[OTH],"School days, school days, teacher's golden ru..."
[OTH],"Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again."
[OTH],Eat banana.
[OTH],"Ike, you can't come to school with me."
Cartman,"Yeah, go home you little dildo!"
[OTH],"Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!"
[OTH],What's a dildo?
[OTH],"Well, I don't know... and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!"
Cartman,I know what it means!
[OTH],"Well, what?"
Cartman,I'm not telling you.
[OTH],"What's a dildo, Kenny?"
[OTH],(It's a plastic dick that goes in a vagina.)
Cartman,"He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right! Ow!"
[OTH],"Dude, that kicks ass!"
[OTH],"Yeah, check this one out. Ready Ike? Kick the baby!"
[OTH],Don't kick the baby.
[OTH],Kick the baby.
[OTH],"Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night."
Cartman,That's 'cause I was having these bogus nightmares.
[OTH],Really? What about?
Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed..."
Cartman,"...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room."
Cartman,Then slowly my bedroom door began to open...
Cartman,"...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway."
Cartman,Weeaak!
Cartman,Then I was lying on a table...
Cartman,...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
[OTH],Dude! Visitors!
[OTH],Totally!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!"
Cartman,"No, it was just a dream, my mom said so."
[OTH],Visitors are real.
[OTH],"Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows."
Cartman,"Oh, shut up, guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working."
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?"
[OTH],"Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley."
Cartman,Kick ass.
[OTH],"Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?"
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"Yeah, fat boy saw it!"
Cartman,"Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!"
[OTH],"Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?"
Cartman,Oh!
[OTH],They took him on their ship.
[OTH],Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
Cartman,Oh!
[OTH],What's an anal probe?
[OTH],That's when they put this big metal hoop-a-joop up yo' butt.
[OTH],Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Cartman,"No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?"
[OTH],"Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!"
Cartman,No!
[OTH],Eneh probe.
Cartman,"Shut up, dildo!"
[OTH],"Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control."
Cartman,Oh!
[OTH],We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
Cartman,"God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!"
[OTH],Why you walkin' so funny Cartman?

[OTH],"Good morning, Miss Crabtree."
[OTH],"SIT DOWN! WE""RE RUNNING LATE!"
[OTH],"Damn it, he's still there."
[OTH],"Oh, don't worry about him."
[OTH],"No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me."
[OTH],SIT DOWN BACK THERE! AAAAAAH!!
[OTH],"Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch."
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?
[OTH],I said I have a bad itch.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Oh, my God!"
[OTH],Visitors!
[OTH],(Oh nooo!)
[OTH],"Ike! STOP THE BUUUUUS! Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!"
[OTH],"SIT DOWN, KID!"

[OTH],But I...
[OTH],Arrgghhh!
[OTH],Arrghh!
[OTH],Arrrggghhh!
[OTH],"Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw?"
Cartman,"Shut up you guys, it's not working."
[OTH],We have to do something!
[OTH],"Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us."
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],"Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do."
[OTH],What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens. You farted.
Cartman,"Heh, somebody's baking brownies."
[OTH],That's the third cow this month. At this rate all my cattle are gonna die before the winter's through.
[OTH],This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time.
[OTH],People been saying they've been seeing UFO's around.
[OTH],UFO's?
[OTH],"Yeah, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks."
[OTH],That is the silliest thing I've ever heard.
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],"That, that was a pigeon."
[OTH],"What am I supposed to do, Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one?"
[OTH],Hey! My cattle!
[OTH],You see? There is somethin' funny goin' on!
[OTH],There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
[OTH],"And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus."
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492, Columbus started a restaurant..."
[OTH],"Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, ""Where's your brother, Kyle?"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"""
[OTH],"Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him."
[OTH],"""You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?"""
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Is there a problem, boys?"
[OTH],"Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now."
[OTH],"Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?"
[OTH],"No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens. It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe."
Cartman,"Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?"
[OTH],"I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!"
[OTH],Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
[OTH],"Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?"
[OTH],"Well, Kyle, NO!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!"
[OTH],"Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle."
[OTH],Damn it!
Cartman,"Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you."
Cartman,Ow! My ass!
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Damn, Cartman!"
Cartman,Uh... Ow! My ass!
[OTH],"Dude, he's farting fire!"
[OTH],It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
Cartman,"No, that was just a dream."
[OTH],"Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?"
Cartman,"No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine."
[OTH],"Hey, you cows can't get on this train! This is a people train. You cows have no business on a people train, all right? 'Cause you're cows."
[OTH],"No, no, no. Don't try any of that cow hypnosis on me, all right? 'Cause it's not gonna work."
[OTH],"Hold it right there, cows!"
[OTH],Come back here! Now then!
[OTH],"So then I had bad, bad gas."
[OTH],"Ya, seriously, killer."
Cartman,"Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry."
[OTH],How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Cartman,"Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature."
[OTH],"Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger."
[OTH],Where?
Cartman,Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger.
[OTH],"Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!"
Cartman,I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
[OTH],I do not!
[OTH],"Hi, guys."
Cartman,"Hi, Wendy."
[OTH],"Here, Stan. This is for you."
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
Cartman,"Bye, Wendy."
[OTH],"Dude, what does the note say?"
[OTH],Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.
[OTH],Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
Cartman,Or slip her the tongue.
[OTH],"(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)"
[OTH],What? How do you know she has a cat?
[OTH],"Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back."
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How are you doing?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?"
[OTH],"Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.

I'm gonna make love to you woman
Gonna lay you down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make you moooooan and perspi-yah!
Gonna--"
[OTH],"Uh, Chef?"
[OTH],--get those juices flowin'--
[OTH],Chef.
[OTH],--we're makin' love gravy--
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],"--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!"
[OTH],CHEF!!!
[OTH],"Love luh--

 Huh?"
[OTH],Do you feel better?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day."
[OTH],Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!"
[OTH],Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
Cartman,You are making it up.
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],That was cool!
[OTH],"It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device."
[OTH],This could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us.
Cartman,"Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?"
[OTH],"It's no joke, children, this is big!"
[OTH],"Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me."
[OTH],"Uuh, hold on now, hold on now. Uhyouyouyou you gotta help the children."
Cartman,"Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!"
[OTH],"Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out! Okay children, this is your chance!"
[OTH],"Killer! Thanks, Chef."
[OTH],"Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I've got to get myself ready."
[OTH],"We got out of school,
No more school today,
We got out of school..."
Cartman,"Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!"
[OTH],"Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now."
Cartman,"I would if I could, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?"
Cartman,"Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control!"
Cartman,"I love to singa,
About the moon-a and the June-a and the springa,
I love to sing-a,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
[OTH],What the hell was that?
[OTH],He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors!
Cartman,"Ah, son of a bitch!"
Cartman,"You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control."
[OTH],Hey!
Cartman,Uh...
[OTH],If you Visitors can hear me-
Cartman,Hey...
[OTH],"-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!"
Cartman,"Ow! That hurts, you buttlicker!"
[OTH],"Kyle, look! It's them."
[OTH],Give me back my brother!
[OTH],Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
[OTH],You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!
[OTH],"Damn it, we were so close!"
[OTH],"Hey look, I think Kenny's okay."
[OTH],"(Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!)"
[OTH],Owww.
[OTH],"(Nope, I'm all fine. Agh!)"
[OTH],"Wow, poor Kenny."
[OTH],"Now do you believe us, Cartman?"
Cartman,No!
[OTH],"Cartman, they killed Kenny!"
Cartman,He's not dead.
[OTH],"Dude, Kenny is dead!"
[OTH],See?
Cartman,"Shut up, you guys."
[OTH],"He's dead, Cartman!"
Cartman,"God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe! Screw you guys, I'm goin' home."
[OTH],"Go on and go home, you fat chicken!"
Cartman,Dildo!
[OTH],"You're all I have left, Stan."
[OTH],"Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger."
[OTH],"You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!"
[OTH],"Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot."
[OTH],Rats.
Cartman,"Hello, Eric."
Cartman,"Hi, Mom."
[OTH],How are you doing?
Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off!"
[OTH],"Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise."
Cartman,I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
[OTH],"You're not fat, you're big boned."
Cartman,That's what I said.
[OTH],"You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?"
Cartman,No!
[OTH],Just a weensy eensy woo woo?
Cartman,"No, leave me alone mom!"
[OTH],"How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?"
Cartman,"What? Well, that does sound pretty good."
Cartman,"Uh, Mom?"
[OTH],"Yes, hon?"
Cartman,"If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?"
[OTH],"Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?"
Cartman,"Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs."
[OTH],"Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now."
[OTH],But her note said she'd be here.
[OTH],"Hi, Stan."
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
[OTH],"You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do."
[OTH],"But why, Stan?"
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
[OTH],"Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Just make sweet love down by the fire.
[OTH],What happened to your little brother?
[OTH],"As the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns."
Cartman,"Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck."
[OTH],"Could it be that aliens are trying to make contact with us, here on Earth?"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie."
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!"
Cartman,Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
[OTH],"Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight!"
Cartman,What?
[OTH],...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
[OTH],"Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back."
[OTH],"Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman."
[OTH],"Come on, Stan."
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
[OTH],"Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, you can't have any!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!"
Cartman,"Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty."
[OTH],"Eric, look who's here."
Cartman,"Dude, weak mom."
[OTH],"Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop."
Cartman,"I can't, my mom said..."
[OTH],"That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends."
Cartman,"But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--"
[OTH],"Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow."
Cartman,God damn it!
Cartman,"You guys, I have to get home."
[OTH],"Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again."
Cartman,"Oh, man, this sucks."
[OTH],How come the Visitors aren't coming for him?
[OTH],I think we have to signal them somehow.
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"Hey, he's like Rudolph."
[OTH],"Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come!"
Cartman,"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight."
[OTH],Sure you do!
[OTH],"Come on Cartman, fart!"
Cartman,I don't wanna.
[OTH],He can't hold it in forever.
[OTH],"Fart, damn you!"
Cartman,"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!"
Cartman,I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
[OTH],"Hey, it's happening again."
[OTH],"Whoa, look at that."
[OTH],"Now, do you believe us, Cartman?"
Cartman,You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
[OTH],"Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!"
Cartman,"Sure, you guys, what-ever."
[OTH],"Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom! And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on."
Cartman,"You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!"
Cartman,"Oh, God damn it!"
[OTH],"What the? I tell you, there's some crazy stuff going on in this town."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Come down here, you stinking aliens!"
[OTH],"Uh, uh..."
[OTH],"Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back."
[OTH],"Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again."
[OTH],"That was beautiful, dude."
[OTH],Did it work?
[OTH],"No, they're leaving."
[OTH],"Hey, you scrawny-eyed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
[OTH],"Hey Wendy, what's a fuck?"
[OTH],Help me doy tair.
[OTH],"Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!"
[OTH],Don't hurt me.
[OTH],"Moo... Moo...Moo moo, moo moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.)"
[OTH],Moo?? (Really??)
[OTH],"Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!"
[OTH],Don't kick the baby.
[OTH],"Moo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)"
Cartman,What the hell are they talking about?
[OTH],Moo moo? (Why did you turn some of us inside out?)
[OTH],"Moo moo, moo. Moo. (Oh, that was Carl's fault. He's new.)"
[OTH],"Moo...moo...moo moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!)"
[OTH],Ike!
[OTH],Moo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.)
[OTH],Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
[OTH],It's my turn!
[OTH],"Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)"
Cartman,"You guys, get me down from here!"
Cartman,Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
[OTH],"Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with."
[OTH],"Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike."
[OTH],"Oh, he fly out the sky."
[OTH],"Wait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back!"
[OTH],"Well, Chef, where's this amazing thing you were going to show us."
[OTH],"Well, i- it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in."
[OTH],"Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner."
[OTH],"Thanks for your help, Wendy."
[OTH],"Whatever, dude."
[OTH],"Hey, I didn't throw up."
[OTH],Cool!
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],"Hey, look. A French fry."
[OTH],Cool.
[OTH],And what is that?
[OTH],I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.
[OTH],"Hey, what's that?"
[OTH],"That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago."
[OTH],"Oh hey, what about that?"
[OTH],I don't know what the hell that is...
[OTH],"Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around."
[OTH],"Yeah, we're running out of friends."
[OTH],I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows.
[OTH],Mooo.
[OTH],Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now.
[OTH],"I love to sing-a,
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a,
I love to sing-a,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
Cartman,Puh!
[OTH],"Oh, hey Cartman."
[OTH],"Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school."
Cartman,"Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night."
[OTH],"Really, what about?"
Cartman,"Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye."
[OTH],"That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened."
Cartman,"Oh right, why don't I have pinkeye then?"
[OTH],"Cartman, you do have pinkeye!"
Cartman,"Ahh, son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"School days, school days, teacher's golden ru..."
[OTH],"Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again."
[OTH],Eat banana.
[OTH],"Ike, you can't come to school with me."
Cartman,"Yeah, go home you little dildo!"
[OTH],"Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!"
[OTH],What's a dildo?
[OTH],"Well, I don't know... and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!"
Cartman,I know what it means!
[OTH],"Well, what?"
Cartman,I'm not telling you.
[OTH],"What's a dildo, Kenny?"
[OTH],(It's a plastic dick that goes in a vagina.)
Cartman,"He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right! Ow!"
[OTH],"Dude, that kicks ass!"
[OTH],"Yeah, check this one out. Ready Ike? Kick the baby!"
[OTH],Don't kick the baby.
[OTH],Kick the baby.
[OTH],"Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night."
Cartman,That's 'cause I was having these bogus nightmares.
[OTH],Really? What about?
Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed..."
Cartman,"...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room."
Cartman,Then slowly my bedroom door began to open...
Cartman,"...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway."
Cartman,Weeaak!
Cartman,Then I was lying on a table...
Cartman,...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
[OTH],Dude! Visitors!
[OTH],Totally!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!"
Cartman,"No, it was just a dream, my mom said so."
[OTH],Visitors are real.
[OTH],"Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows."
Cartman,"Oh, shut up, guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working."
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?"
[OTH],"Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley."
Cartman,Kick ass.
[OTH],"Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?"
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"Yeah, fat boy saw it!"
Cartman,"Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!"
[OTH],"Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?"
Cartman,Oh!
[OTH],They took him on their ship.
[OTH],Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
Cartman,Oh!
[OTH],What's an anal probe?
[OTH],That's when they put this big metal hoop-a-joop up yo' butt.
[OTH],Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Cartman,"No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?"
[OTH],"Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!"
Cartman,No!
[OTH],Eneh probe.
Cartman,"Shut up, dildo!"
[OTH],"Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control."
Cartman,Oh!
[OTH],We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
Cartman,"God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!"
[OTH],Why you walkin' so funny Cartman?
Cartman,Shut up!
[OTH],Oh foonuh bebe.
[OTH],"No, Ike, go home."

[OTH],"Good morning, Miss Crabtree."
[OTH],"SIT DOWN! WE""RE RUNNING LATE!"
[OTH],"Damn it, he's still there."
[OTH],"Oh, don't worry about him."
[OTH],"No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me."
[OTH],SIT DOWN BACK THERE! AAAAAAH!!
[OTH],"Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch."
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?
[OTH],I said I have a bad itch.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Oh, my God!"
[OTH],Visitors!

[OTH],"Ike! STOP THE BUUUUUS! Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!"
[OTH],"SIT DOWN, KID!"
[OTH],But I have to get off!
[OTH],DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL!?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],Then sit down!
[OTH],But I...
[OTH],Arrgghhh!
[OTH],Arrghh!
[OTH],Arrrggghhh!
[OTH],"Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw?"
Cartman,"Shut up you guys, it's not working."
[OTH],We have to do something!
[OTH],"Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us."
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],"Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do."
[OTH],What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens. You farted.
Cartman,"Heh, somebody's baking brownies."
[OTH],That's the third cow this month. At this rate all my cattle are gonna die before the winter's through.
[OTH],This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time.
[OTH],People been saying they've been seeing UFO's around.
[OTH],UFO's?
[OTH],"Yeah, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks."
[OTH],That is the silliest thing I've ever heard.
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],"That, that was a pigeon."
[OTH],"What am I supposed to do, Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one?"
[OTH],Hey! My cattle!
[OTH],You see? There is somethin' funny goin' on!
[OTH],There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
[OTH],"And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus."
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492, Columbus started a restaurant..."
[OTH],"Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, ""Where's your brother, Kyle?"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"""
[OTH],"Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him."
[OTH],"""You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?"""
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Is there a problem, boys?"
[OTH],"Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now."
[OTH],"Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?"
[OTH],"No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens. It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe."
Cartman,"Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?"
[OTH],"I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!"
[OTH],Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
[OTH],"Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?"
[OTH],"Well, Kyle, NO!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!"
[OTH],"Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle."
[OTH],Damn it!
Cartman,"Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you."
Cartman,Ow! My ass!
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Damn, Cartman!"
Cartman,Uh... Ow! My ass!
[OTH],"Dude, he's farting fire!"
[OTH],It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
Cartman,"No, that was just a dream."
[OTH],"Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?"
Cartman,"No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine."
[OTH],"Hey, you cows can't get on this train! This is a people train. You cows have no business on a people train, all right? 'Cause you're cows."
[OTH],"No, no, no. Don't try any of that cow hypnosis on me, all right? 'Cause it's not gonna work."
[OTH],"Hold it right there, cows!"
[OTH],Come back here! Now then!
[OTH],"So then I had bad, bad gas."
[OTH],"Ya, seriously, killer."
Cartman,"Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry."
[OTH],How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Cartman,"Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature."
[OTH],"Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger."
[OTH],Where?
Cartman,Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger.
[OTH],"Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!"
Cartman,I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
[OTH],I do not!
[OTH],"Hi, guys."
Cartman,"Hi, Wendy."
[OTH],"Here, Stan. This is for you."
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
Cartman,"Bye, Wendy."
[OTH],"Dude, what does the note say?"
[OTH],Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.
[OTH],Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
Cartman,Or slip her the tongue.
[OTH],"(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)"
[OTH],What? How do you know she has a cat?
[OTH],"Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back."
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How are you doing?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?"
[OTH],"Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.

I'm gonna make love to you woman
Gonna lay you down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make you moooooan and perspi-yah!
Gonna--"
[OTH],"Uh, Chef?"
[OTH],--get those juices flowin'--
[OTH],Chef.
[OTH],--we're makin' love gravy--
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],"--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!"
[OTH],CHEF!!!
[OTH],"Love luh--

 Huh?"
[OTH],Do you feel better?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day."
[OTH],Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!"
[OTH],Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
Cartman,You are making it up.
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],That was cool!
[OTH],"It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device."
[OTH],This could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us.
Cartman,"Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?"
[OTH],"It's no joke, children, this is big!"
[OTH],"Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me."
[OTH],"Uuh, hold on now, hold on now. Uhyouyouyou you gotta help the children."
Cartman,"Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!"
[OTH],"Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out! Okay children, this is your chance!"
[OTH],"Killer! Thanks, Chef."
[OTH],"Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I've got to get myself ready."
[OTH],"We got out of school,
No more school today,
We got out of school..."
Cartman,"Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!"
[OTH],"Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now."
Cartman,"I would if I could, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?"
Cartman,"Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control!"
Cartman,"I love to singa,
About the moon-a and the June-a and the springa,
I love to sing-a,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
[OTH],What the hell was that?
[OTH],He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors!
Cartman,"Ah, son of a bitch!"
Cartman,"You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control."
[OTH],Hey!
Cartman,Uh...
[OTH],If you Visitors can hear me-
Cartman,Hey...
[OTH],"-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!"
Cartman,"Ow! That hurts, you buttlicker!"
[OTH],"Kyle, look! It's them."
[OTH],Give me back my brother!
[OTH],Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
[OTH],You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!
[OTH],"Damn it, we were so close!"
[OTH],"Hey look, I think Kenny's okay."
[OTH],"(Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!)"
[OTH],Owww.
[OTH],"(Nope, I'm all fine. Agh!)"
[OTH],"Wow, poor Kenny."
[OTH],"Now do you believe us, Cartman?"
Cartman,No!
[OTH],"Cartman, they killed Kenny!"
Cartman,He's not dead.
[OTH],"Dude, Kenny is dead!"
[OTH],See?
Cartman,"Shut up, you guys."
[OTH],"He's dead, Cartman!"
Cartman,"God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe! Screw you guys, I'm goin' home."
[OTH],"Go on and go home, you fat chicken!"
Cartman,Dildo!
[OTH],"You're all I have left, Stan."
[OTH],"Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger."
[OTH],"You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!"
[OTH],"Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot."
[OTH],Rats.
Cartman,"Hello, Eric."
Cartman,"Hi, Mom."
[OTH],How are you doing?
Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off!"
[OTH],"Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise."
Cartman,I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
[OTH],"You're not fat, you're big boned."
Cartman,That's what I said.
[OTH],"You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?"
Cartman,No!
[OTH],Just a weensy eensy woo woo?
Cartman,"No, leave me alone mom!"
[OTH],"How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?"
Cartman,"What? Well, that does sound pretty good."
Cartman,"Uh, Mom?"
[OTH],"Yes, hon?"
Cartman,"If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?"
[OTH],"Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?"
Cartman,"Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs."
[OTH],"Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now."
[OTH],But her note said she'd be here.
[OTH],"Hi, Stan."
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
[OTH],"You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do."
[OTH],"But why, Stan?"
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
[OTH],"Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Just make sweet love down by the fire.
[OTH],What happened to your little brother?
[OTH],"As the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns."
Cartman,"Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck."
[OTH],"Could it be that aliens are trying to make contact with us, here on Earth?"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie."
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!"
Cartman,Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
[OTH],"Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight!"
Cartman,What?
[OTH],...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
[OTH],"Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back."
[OTH],"Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman."
[OTH],"Come on, Stan."
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
[OTH],"Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, you can't have any!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!"
Cartman,"Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty."
[OTH],"Eric, look who's here."
Cartman,"Dude, weak mom."
[OTH],"Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop."
Cartman,"I can't, my mom said..."
[OTH],"That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends."
Cartman,"But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--"
[OTH],"Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow."
Cartman,God damn it!
Cartman,"You guys, I have to get home."
[OTH],"Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again."
Cartman,"Oh, man, this sucks."
[OTH],How come the Visitors aren't coming for him?
[OTH],I think we have to signal them somehow.
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"Hey, he's like Rudolph."
[OTH],"Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come!"
Cartman,"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight."
[OTH],Sure you do!
[OTH],"Come on Cartman, fart!"
Cartman,I don't wanna.
[OTH],He can't hold it in forever.
[OTH],"Fart, damn you!"
Cartman,"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!"
Cartman,I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
[OTH],"Hey, it's happening again."
[OTH],"Whoa, look at that."
[OTH],"Now, do you believe us, Cartman?"
Cartman,You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
[OTH],"Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!"
Cartman,"Sure, you guys, what-ever."
[OTH],"Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom! And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on."
Cartman,"You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!"
Cartman,"Oh, God damn it!"
[OTH],"What the? I tell you, there's some crazy stuff going on in this town."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Come down here, you stinking aliens!"
[OTH],"Uh, uh..."
[OTH],"Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back."
[OTH],"Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again."
[OTH],"That was beautiful, dude."
[OTH],Did it work?
[OTH],"No, they're leaving."
[OTH],"Hey, you scrawny-eyed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
[OTH],"Hey Wendy, what's a fuck?"
[OTH],Help me doy tair.
[OTH],"Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!"
[OTH],Don't hurt me.
[OTH],"Moo... Moo...Moo moo, moo moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.)"
[OTH],Moo?? (Really??)
[OTH],"Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!"
[OTH],Don't kick the baby.
[OTH],"Moo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)"
Cartman,What the hell are they talking about?
[OTH],Moo moo? (Why did you turn some of us inside out?)
[OTH],"Moo moo, moo. Moo. (Oh, that was Carl's fault. He's new.)"
[OTH],"Moo...moo...moo moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!)"
[OTH],Ike!
[OTH],Moo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.)
[OTH],Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
[OTH],It's my turn!
[OTH],"Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)"
Cartman,"You guys, get me down from here!"
Cartman,Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
[OTH],"Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with."
[OTH],"Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike."
[OTH],"Oh, he fly out the sky."
[OTH],"Wait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back!"
[OTH],"Well, Chef, where's this amazing thing you were going to show us."
[OTH],"Well, i- it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in."
[OTH],"Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner."
[OTH],"Thanks for your help, Wendy."
[OTH],"Whatever, dude."
[OTH],"Hey, I didn't throw up."
[OTH],Cool!
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Eww!
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],"Hey, look. A French fry."
[OTH],Cool.
[OTH],And what is that?
[OTH],I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.
[OTH],"Hey, what's that?"
[OTH],"That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago."
[OTH],"Oh hey, what about that?"
[OTH],I don't know what the hell that is...
[OTH],"Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around."
[OTH],"Yeah, we're running out of friends."
[OTH],I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows.
[OTH],Mooo.
[OTH],Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now.
[OTH],"I love to sing-a,
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a,
I love to sing-a,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
Cartman,Puh!
[OTH],"Oh, hey Cartman."
[OTH],"Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school."
Cartman,"Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night."
[OTH],"Really, what about?"
Cartman,"Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye."
[OTH],"That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened."
Cartman,"Oh right, why don't I have pinkeye then?"
[OTH],"Cartman, you do have pinkeye!"
Cartman,"Ahh, son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?"
[OTH],"Yeah, it was huge."
Cartman,"Ugh, I hate those things."
[OTH],Nobody hates rainbows.
[OTH],"Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?"
Cartman,"Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: ""HEY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!"""
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?"
Cartman,"I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!"
[OTH],Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Cartman,"Ohh, rainbows. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool."
[OTH],What were you talking about?
Cartman,"Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it."
[OTH],"No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?"
Cartman,Nothing..!
[OTH],"Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month? One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize."
[OTH],"Wow, I knew I would win."
[OTH],"Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting."
[OTH],"That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper."
Cartman,Kick ass!
[OTH],"That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart."
Cartman,"Yeah I do, Pop-Tarts are frosted."
[OTH],"Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner."
[OTH],"Wow, what did you write about Cartman?"
Cartman,"Oh, you know, this and that."
[OTH],He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
[OTH],What was your paper about Wendy?
[OTH],My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins.
Cartman,"There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid."
[OTH],"Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet."
Cartman,"Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford?"
[OTH],Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?!
[OTH],And the presentation will be on national television.
[OTH],Television!
[OTH],Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.
[OTH],Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
[OTH],"Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity."
[OTH],"Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator."
[OTH],Maybe even a State Senator.
[OTH],"Mayor, we should decorate the town square."
[OTH],"Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town."
[OTH],"That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?"
[OTH],"Black as the night itself, Mayor."
[OTH],Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
[OTH],If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.
[OTH],Ohhh.
[OTH],Ouch. Thank you.
Cartman,"You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous."
[OTH],Hitler was famous too.
[OTH],Hello there children.
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How are my little crackers today?
[OTH],Good.
[OTH],Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
[OTH],"Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest."
Cartman,Hey!
[OTH],Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
[OTH],"Wow, are you gonna do it?"
[OTH],"Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation."
[OTH],"Yeah, that'd be cool."
[OTH],"(How big's your penis, Chef?)"
[OTH],"Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway."
[OTH],"Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement."
[OTH],Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
[OTH],Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?
[OTH],"Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child."
[OTH],"We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge."
[OTH],"Knock knock, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],Who's there?
[OTH],Orange.
[OTH],Orange who?
[OTH],Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win."
[OTH],"And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein."
[OTH],"If they could see me now, that little gang of mine.
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine.
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer first-rate chums I attract All I can say is, ""Wow-wee, look-a where I am."" Tonight I landed, Pow!, right in a pot of jam.
What a setup! Holy Cow!
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now!"
[OTH],It wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that?
[OTH],"But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better."
[OTH],How?
[OTH],"No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!"
[OTH],"Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay."
Cartman,That kid is me.
[OTH],"Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park."
[OTH],"That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat."
[OTH],Kill her.
[OTH],Mr. Hat!
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play."
[OTH],"Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her."
[OTH],"Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated."
[OTH],"Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!"
[OTH],And who's our little prize winner again?
Cartman,Me! Eric Cartman!
[OTH],"How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?"
Cartman,"Yes ma'am. I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television."
Cartman,"...I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television..."
[OTH],"We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy."
Cartman,"Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish."
[OTH],"Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly."
Cartman,Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
[OTH],Dolphins are way smarter than you!
Cartman,"If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?"
[OTH],"Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!"
Cartman,"Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!"
[OTH],Tell me what you wrote about!
Cartman,I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
[OTH],"Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!"
Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!"
[OTH],"We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals, after this."
[OTH],Hey!! You need to get in shape fast?! Wanna look your best?! Tired of the other guys getting all the chicks?! Are you tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!
Cartman,"Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds."
[OTH],"Then bulk up quick, with Weight Gain 4000!!"
Cartman,Yes!
[OTH],"With over 4,000 grams of saturated fat per serving, its patented formula is designed to enter the mouth, and go directly to the stomach where it is distributed to the bloodstream. Now available in stores everywhere. Get some today, and say with me: 'Beefcake!'"
Cartman,Beefcake!
[OTH],Beefcake!
Cartman,Beefcake!
[OTH],Beefcake!
Cartman,BEEFCAKE!

Cartman,"Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?"
[OTH],"Okay Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow."
Cartman,"But mom, I need it for tomorrow."
[OTH],But tomorrow is grocery day Eric.
Cartman,"Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!"
[OTH],"Okay, okay, then. I guess I'll be going to the store now then."
[OTH],"No, no!"
[OTH],Kill her.
[OTH],"No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it."
[OTH],Kill!
[OTH],"That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],She'll make a fool of you again.
[OTH],"Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy."
Cartman,Hey dudes.
[OTH],"What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?"
Cartman,"Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?"
[OTH],What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
Cartman,"I'm up to 94, thank you very much."
[OTH],(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)
[OTH],"Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's."
Cartman,"Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff."
[OTH],What's that stuff?
Cartman,"Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up."
[OTH],"Bulk up to what, fat-ass?"
[OTH],Super fat-ass?
Cartman,Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
Cartman,"Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh."
[OTH],"Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!"
[OTH],Mooooo?
[OTH],"Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?"
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top."
[OTH],"Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it."
[OTH],"Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage."
[OTH],Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage.
[OTH],"Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?"
[OTH],Do you have a feather on your head?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Then you're an Indian.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Okay Bebe, this is your line."
[OTH],This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
[OTH],"Oh, don't they look adorable?"
[OTH],"Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers."
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy."
[OTH],"The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford."
[OTH],"Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days."
[OTH],Take that you stupid Indian!
[OTH],Dow!
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?"
[OTH],To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!
[OTH],"Oh my God, what have I said?"
[OTH],"He said, ""To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"""
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play."
[OTH],It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.
[OTH],I can't kill her Mr. Hat...you're gonna have to do it.
[OTH],"Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load."
Cartman,"Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely."
[OTH],"You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!"
Cartman,I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
[OTH],"Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"""
Cartman,"No they don't, you jealous weakling!"
[OTH],"God damn, that's a big fat ass!"
Cartman,Hey!
[OTH],Hi guys.
Cartman,"Oh look, another hippie."
Cartman,"Peace, Wendy."
[OTH],Shut up Cartman!
Cartman,"Oooh, 
Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree..."
[OTH],I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.
Cartman,...K I S S I N G. First comes the baby and...
[OTH],Can I help you?
[OTH],Yes... I need a gun.
[OTH],"Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?"
[OTH],Other.
[OTH],"Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!"
[OTH],That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
[OTH],"You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? I don't know, it's a little small."
[OTH],"Okay, how about this?"
[OTH],"You talkin' to me? Hmm, no, I don't like this one either."
[OTH],"Here's the same gun, with a wood finish."
[OTH],"You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me. I'll take it!"
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"My essay by Eric Cartman: ""When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."""
[OTH],"Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!"
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],"Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun."
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],Nice gun Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],Thanks.
[OTH],Hello Officer Barbrady.
[OTH],Nice Gun.
[OTH],"Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee."
[OTH],"Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet."
[OTH],"Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],No problem.
[OTH],Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee!
[OTH],Where is she?
Cartman,This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
[OTH],I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
[OTH],"You guys, we have to stop him!"
[OTH],Stop who?
[OTH],Mr. Garrison! He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford!
Cartman,"Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame."
[OTH],He's got a gun!
Cartman,"You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you."
[OTH],"It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!"
[OTH],"Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?"
[OTH],"Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?"
[OTH],"Uh oh, we're losing him."
[OTH],Here she comes.
[OTH],"Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford."
[OTH],"We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh."
[OTH],"I love you, too."
[OTH],"Come on you little bitch. You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy."
[OTH],It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
[OTH],"...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford."
[OTH],"Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of uh, the humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.

Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you dowwwwn.
And lick every inch of your bodaay with my tongue."
[OTH],WHAT?!
[OTH],"Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy."
[OTH],What? Oh God!
[OTH],How 'bout you and meee-
[OTH],"Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song."
[OTH],"-get together and make... sweet... 

 love?"
[OTH],Thank you Chef!
[OTH],"Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!"
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!"
[OTH],What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute.
[OTH],"Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee."
[OTH],"Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ..."
[OTH],"Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!"
[OTH],"Wendy, look!"
[OTH],"And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman..."
Cartman,"Cartman, God damn it."
[OTH],"...is your favorite celebrity, and mine, Kathie Lee Gifford!"
[OTH],Thank you. I love you all.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, stop!"
[OTH],Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
[OTH],I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
[OTH],You can't know.
[OTH],You should have won that talent show.
[OTH],"It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?"
Cartman,"Here it is, my big moment of fame."
[OTH],...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
[OTH],"I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer."
[OTH],"It is... too late for me, young Wendy."
[OTH],"You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose."
[OTH],You... you're right.
[OTH],Gooood.
[OTH],"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?"
[OTH],The bitch must die!
[OTH],Aaaooghhhh!
[OTH],(Oh no!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!"
[OTH],Gun!
[OTH],Gun!
[OTH],"Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play."
[OTH],"I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up."
Cartman,Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
[OTH],"Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest."
Cartman,But I won the environmental essay contest.
[OTH],You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.
[OTH],"I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place."
[OTH],Who cares?
[OTH],"Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone."
[OTH],"What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?"
[OTH],"Well, not if it's Cartman."
[OTH],"Hey, where are you all going!"
[OTH],They don't even know what Walden is.
[OTH],I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.
[OTH],"Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches."
[OTH],"Ah, what the hell."
[OTH],"Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!"
[OTH],"Uh, Mayor, the mic is on."
[OTH],"Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids."
[OTH],You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt.
[OTH],We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],"Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy."
[OTH],We can still get her! Let mmm--
[OTH],I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
[OTH],"Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway."
[OTH],"Really, on what?"
[OTH],"Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat-ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house."
Cartman,When is this going to be on the air?
[OTH],Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?
Cartman,"Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!"
[OTH],He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
[OTH],"Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?"
[OTH],"Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?"
[OTH],"Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?"
[OTH],"Yeah, it was huge."
Cartman,"Ugh, I hate those things."
[OTH],Nobody hates rainbows.
[OTH],"Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?"
Cartman,"Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: ""HEY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!"""
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?"
Cartman,"I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!"
[OTH],Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Cartman,"Ohh, rainbows. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool."
[OTH],What were you talking about?
Cartman,"Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it."
[OTH],"No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?"
Cartman,Nothing..!
[OTH],"Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month? One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize."
[OTH],"Wow, I knew I would win."
[OTH],"Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting."
[OTH],"That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper."
Cartman,Kick ass!
[OTH],"That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart."
Cartman,"Yeah I do, Pop-Tarts are frosted."
[OTH],"Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner."
[OTH],"Wow, what did you write about Cartman?"
Cartman,"Oh, you know, this and that."
[OTH],He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
[OTH],What was your paper about Wendy?
[OTH],My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins.
Cartman,"There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid."
[OTH],"Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet."
Cartman,"Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford?"
[OTH],Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?!
[OTH],And the presentation will be on national television.
[OTH],Television!
[OTH],Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.
[OTH],Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
[OTH],"Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity."
[OTH],"Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator."
[OTH],Maybe even a State Senator.
[OTH],"Mayor, we should decorate the town square."
[OTH],"Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town."
[OTH],"That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?"
[OTH],"Black as the night itself, Mayor."
[OTH],Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
[OTH],If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.
[OTH],Ohhh.
[OTH],Ouch. Thank you.
Cartman,"You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous."
[OTH],Hitler was famous too.
[OTH],Hello there children.
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How are my little crackers today?
[OTH],Good.
[OTH],Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
[OTH],"Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest."
Cartman,Hey!
[OTH],Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
[OTH],"Wow, are you gonna do it?"
[OTH],"Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation."
[OTH],"Yeah, that'd be cool."
[OTH],"(How big's your penis, Chef?)"
[OTH],"Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway."
[OTH],"Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement."
[OTH],Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
[OTH],Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?
[OTH],"Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child."
[OTH],"We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge."
[OTH],"Knock knock, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],Who's there?
[OTH],Orange.
[OTH],Orange who?
[OTH],Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win."
[OTH],"And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein."
[OTH],"If they could see me now, that little gang of mine.
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine.
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer first-rate chums I attract All I can say is, ""Wow-wee, look-a where I am."" Tonight I landed, Pow!, right in a pot of jam.
What a setup! Holy Cow!
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now!"
[OTH],It wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that?
[OTH],"But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better."
[OTH],How?
[OTH],"No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!"
[OTH],"Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay."
Cartman,That kid is me.
[OTH],"Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park."
[OTH],"That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat."
[OTH],Kill her.
[OTH],Mr. Hat!
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play."
[OTH],"Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her."
[OTH],"Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated."
[OTH],"Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!"
[OTH],And who's our little prize winner again?
Cartman,Me! Eric Cartman!
[OTH],"How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?"
Cartman,"Yes ma'am. I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television."
Cartman,"...I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television..."
[OTH],"We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy."
Cartman,"Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish."
[OTH],"Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly."
Cartman,Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
[OTH],Dolphins are way smarter than you!
Cartman,"If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?"
[OTH],"Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!"
Cartman,"Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!"
[OTH],Tell me what you wrote about!
Cartman,I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
[OTH],"Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!"
Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!"

[OTH],"Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!"
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],"Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun."
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],Nice gun Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],Thanks.
[OTH],Hello Officer Barbrady.
[OTH],Nice Gun.
[OTH],"Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee."
[OTH],"Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet."
[OTH],"Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],No problem.
[OTH],Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee!
[OTH],Where is she?
Cartman,This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
[OTH],I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
[OTH],"You guys, we have to stop him!"
[OTH],Stop who?
[OTH],Mr. Garrison! He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford!
Cartman,"Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame."
[OTH],He's got a gun!
Cartman,"You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you."
[OTH],"It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!"
[OTH],"Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?"
[OTH],"Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?"
[OTH],"Uh oh, we're losing him."
[OTH],Here she comes.
[OTH],"Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford."
[OTH],"We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh."
[OTH],"I love you, too."
[OTH],"Come on you little bitch. You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy."
[OTH],It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
[OTH],"...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford."
[OTH],"Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of uh, the humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.

Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you dowwwwn.
And lick every inch of your bodaay with my tongue."
[OTH],WHAT?!
[OTH],"Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy."
[OTH],What? Oh God!
[OTH],How 'bout you and meee-
[OTH],"Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song."
[OTH],"-get together and make... sweet... 

 love?"
[OTH],Thank you Chef!
[OTH],"Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!"
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!"
[OTH],What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute.
[OTH],"Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee."
[OTH],"Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ..."
[OTH],"Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!"
[OTH],"Wendy, look!"
[OTH],"And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman..."
Cartman,"Cartman, God damn it."
[OTH],"...is your favorite celebrity, and mine, Kathie Lee Gifford!"
[OTH],Thank you. I love you all.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, stop!"
[OTH],Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
[OTH],I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
[OTH],You can't know.
[OTH],You should have won that talent show.
[OTH],"It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?"
Cartman,"Here it is, my big moment of fame."
[OTH],...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
[OTH],"I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer."
[OTH],"It is... too late for me, young Wendy."
[OTH],"You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose."
[OTH],You... you're right.
[OTH],Gooood.
[OTH],"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?"
[OTH],The bitch must die!
[OTH],Aaaooghhhh!
[OTH],(Oh no!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!"
[OTH],Gun!
[OTH],Gun!
[OTH],"Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play."
[OTH],"I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up."
Cartman,Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
[OTH],"Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest."
Cartman,But I won the environmental essay contest.
[OTH],You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.
[OTH],"I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place."
[OTH],Who cares?
[OTH],"Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone."
[OTH],"What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?"
[OTH],"Well, not if it's Cartman."
[OTH],"Hey, where are you all going!"
[OTH],They don't even know what Walden is.
[OTH],I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.
[OTH],"Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches."
[OTH],"Ah, what the hell."
[OTH],"Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!"
[OTH],"Uh, Mayor, the mic is on."
[OTH],"Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids."
[OTH],You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt.
[OTH],We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],"Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy."
[OTH],We can still get her! Let mmm--
[OTH],I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
[OTH],"Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway."
[OTH],"Really, on what?"
[OTH],"Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat-ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house."
Cartman,When is this going to be on the air?
[OTH],Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?
Cartman,"Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!"
[OTH],He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
[OTH],"Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?"
[OTH],"Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?"
[OTH],"Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous."
Cartman,"Okay, Mom."
[OTH],"Ready to go hunting, Cartman?"
[OTH],"Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?"
[OTH],"That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning."
[OTH],"Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts."
[OTH],"Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe."
[OTH],"Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?"
[OTH],"Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy."
Cartman,"Dude, that's sick mom."
[OTH],"And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away."
Cartman,"Drive, Drive!"
[OTH],You give your mommy a kissy.
Cartman,"Drive the car damn-it, drive!"
[OTH],Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
Cartman,"Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing."
[OTH],"Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman."
[OTH],(Maybe she'll suck my dick.)
[OTH],"Oh, ho, that's disgusting."
Cartman,"You piece of crap, I'll kill you!"
[OTH],"That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'."
Cartman,Eeeeenh!
[OTH],"Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber."
[OTH],"Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer."
[OTH],You what?!?
[OTH],"mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm."
[OTH],I like chocolate milk.
[OTH],"Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization."
[OTH],"Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes."
Cartman,"Hey, I didn't get a gun."
Cartman,Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
[OTH],"You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman."
[OTH],Were you stationed in Da Nang?
[OTH],"Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says."
Cartman,"Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off."
[OTH],"Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer."
[OTH],"My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa."
[OTH],"Wow, that'd be cool."
Cartman,My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
[OTH],"Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!"
[OTH],"Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there."
[OTH],"Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting."
Cartman,Democrats piss me off!
[OTH],"They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'"
[OTH],"Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo."
[OTH],"Mmm, Jimbo look, mm."
[OTH],"Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!"
Cartman,Kickass!!
[OTH],"Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck."
[OTH],"Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock."
[OTH],"Let's move, moove!"
[OTH],Is this hunting?
[OTH],I guess so.
Cartman,"Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks."
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,"Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!"
[OTH],This one's yours Stan.
[OTH],It's coming right for us.
[OTH],It's coming right for us.
[OTH],Shoot it Stan.
Cartman,"I got your back, soldier."
[OTH],I can't.
[OTH],What the? What's wrong with you?
[OTH],I don't wanna shoot the bunny.
[OTH],"What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical."
[OTH],"I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny."
[OTH],No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.
Cartman,"Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything."
[OTH],"I can shoot you, fat ass!"
Cartman,I can shoot you too!
[OTH],I'll kill you!
Cartman,I'll fill you full of lead!
[OTH],"Hey, what's that?"
[OTH],What the heck is this?
[OTH],"Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!"
Cartman,My weenies won't cook.
[OTH],"Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm."
[OTH],"Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick."
[OTH],"Mmm, yepper."
[OTH],"Mmm, aahh, oh."
[OTH],"Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?"
[OTH],"Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm."
Cartman,"Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah."
[OTH],"But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?"
[OTH],"We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but..."
[OTH],"Mayor, the geologist is here to see you."
[OTH],My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
[OTH],"No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth."
[OTH],"Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!"
[OTH],"I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker."
[OTH],Just send in the geometrist.
[OTH],Geologist...
[OTH],"You are fired, buddy!"
[OTH],"Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you."
[OTH],"Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt."
[OTH],What does this mean to the town?
[OTH],"Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad."
[OTH],Right now South Park is here.
[OTH],My God!
[OTH],"Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!"
[OTH],"Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there?"
[OTH],"Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted."
[OTH],"Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh. Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control."
[OTH],"And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day."
[OTH],Mmmowwwh.
[OTH],"Hah, got ya."
Cartman,"Heh, tha-that's not scary."
[OTH],You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!
Cartman,"Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!"
[OTH],"Hey Ned, hand me that gin."
[OTH],You boys want to tie one on?
[OTH],"No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee."
[OTH],"Yeah, Cartman's pee."
Cartman,"Hey, you would taste my pee!"
[OTH],What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?
[OTH],"Christ, look at that little bastard go!"
[OTH],"Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!"
[OTH],"Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too."
Cartman,Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!"
Cartman,Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of Scuzzlebutt?
[OTH],Whatabutt?
Cartman,"Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top."
[OTH],Why?
Cartman,"Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body."
[OTH],Deformed how?
Cartman,"Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has..."
[OTH],A hook.
[OTH],A knife.
Cartman,No! A piece of celery.
[OTH],Celery?
Cartman,"Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy."
[OTH],"Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!"
Cartman,"What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink."
[OTH],"Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories."
[OTH],"Yeah, give me that flashlight."
[OTH],"(Hey, what's that?)"
[OTH],What is that?
[OTH],Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Cartman,"Hey, it might be!"
[OTH],"Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand."
Cartman,Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
[OTH],"Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song."
[OTH],"Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah. Mmmoh lord, Kumbayah.
Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah..."
Cartman,They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!
[OTH],"...Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah."
[OTH],"Stan, Stan, wake up!"
[OTH],"What, dude?"
[OTH],I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
[OTH],Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
[OTH],They're out fishing with Kenny.
[OTH],"With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?"
[OTH],"Well Stan, you want to know what I think?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!"
[OTH],"Mmm, got it."
[OTH],Great instincts boy.
[OTH],"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!"
[OTH],Who? The fat kid?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!"
[OTH],"Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit."
[OTH],Moh man it smells like dead fish here.
[OTH],(A little like a vagina.)
[OTH],"Em-moh man, that is nasty."
[OTH],"Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew."
[OTH],(Thanks.)
[OTH],"The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony."
[OTH],Yeahhh.
[OTH],"Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!"
[OTH],"Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?"
[OTH],"All we know right now is that some of our children are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Well you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1 All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids."
[OTH],Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
[OTH],"Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off."
[OTH],"There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on."
[OTH],"Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast."
[OTH],Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.
[OTH],"Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!"
[OTH],"Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun."
[OTH],Look!
Cartman,"I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg."
[OTH],"Mmm, what is it?"
[OTH],"Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying."
[OTH],Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
[OTH],"We'll be on the cover of ""Guns & Ammo""."
[OTH],This calls for some HJ-14.
Cartman,Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
[OTH],Fire in the hoooole!
Cartman,Holy crap!
[OTH],"Damn it, I think I missed."
Cartman,What the hell is wrong with you people?!
[OTH],"C'mon, let's move, move!"
Cartman,"Hey, wait, aah!"
[OTH],"Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!"
[OTH],"Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea."
[OTH],"Huh, what?"
[OTH],"Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely."
[OTH],"And, that would be good? Right?"
[OTH],Uh - pretty sure.
[OTH],"Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!"
[OTH],"These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!! The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe."
[OTH],"Look, up there."
Cartman,"You guys, it's just me."
[OTH],Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?
[OTH],Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?
[OTH],I can't tell; let's kill it!
Cartman,"Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume."
[OTH],"Kenny, you take the front."
[OTH],No!
[OTH],I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
[OTH],"That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!"
Cartman,"You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!"
[OTH],"As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary."
[OTH],"Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please."
[OTH],"Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt."
[OTH],"That's right Jane, duck and cover."
[OTH],So what will you -do when you hear a volcano erupting?
[OTH],"That's right, duck and cover."
[OTH],Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.
[OTH],"OK, any questions?"
[OTH],That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
[OTH],That's enough out of you!
[OTH],I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Cartman,"Hey, seriously you guys!"
[OTH],"Kill it, Stan. Kill it. Come on Stan, kill it."
[OTH],"Ah, damn it, I can't do it!"
[OTH],You pansy! give me that gun.
Cartman,Hey!
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,"Goddammit, don't shoot me!"
[OTH],What the Sam Hell?
Cartman,"I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now."
[OTH],"Mmm, so much for the cover of ""Guns & Ammo""."
[OTH],"Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Mmm, holy crap."
[OTH],The mountain! It's blown it's top!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],"(Nope, I'm okay.)"
[OTH],(It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)
[OTH],(Ugh.)
[OTH],"Look, the volcano."
[OTH],"Quick, duck and cover."
Cartman,Aaaaah!
[OTH],That lava's coming right for us!!
[OTH],"Oh no, look."
[OTH],What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
[OTH],"It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava."
[OTH],"God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-"
Cartman,Help!
[OTH],"Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!"
Cartman,What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
[OTH],Oh my God! Look at his leg!
[OTH],"Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy."
[OTH],"Quick Ned, shoot it!"
[OTH],"Mmmoh no, out of ammo."
[OTH],Grrrr.
[OTH],What... is that thing?
[OTH],That's Scuzzlebutt.
[OTH],"Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets."
[OTH],This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
[OTH],"Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed."
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],"Whoa, he built a wicker basket."
[OTH],"Hey, he's saving us."
[OTH],Grrr.
[OTH],Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
[OTH],And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
[OTH],Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
[OTH],Uhh...
[OTH],Aaaaah.
[OTH],South Park is saved.
[OTH],"Hey look, Kenny's okay."
[OTH],"(Hey guys, what's goin' down?)"
[OTH],And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.
[OTH],"Mmmm
Baby every time that we kiss,
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava,
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat,
Lava so warm and red and wet,
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr."
[OTH],"Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?"
[OTH],"Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt."
[OTH],Friend.
[OTH],"Oh, how sweet."
[OTH],"I did it, I did it, I finally killed something."
[OTH],Oh my God! What has he done?
[OTH],Turn off the cameras!
[OTH],"Hey, that was easy!"
[OTH],Noooo! Why God? Why?!
[OTH],"Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!"
[OTH],What?! Why?!
[OTH],"Yeah, make up your mind, dude!"
[OTH],"Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm."
[OTH],"(Oh, no!)"
[OTH],"But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny."
[OTH],"But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?"
[OTH],"Dude, I don't understand hunting at all."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons."
Cartman,"Yeah, cartoons kick ass!"
[OTH],"Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous."
Cartman,"Okay, Mom."
[OTH],"Ready to go hunting, Cartman?"
[OTH],"Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?"
[OTH],"That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning."
[OTH],"Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts."
[OTH],"Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe."
[OTH],"Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?"
[OTH],"Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy."
Cartman,"Dude, that's sick mom."
[OTH],"And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away."
Cartman,"Drive, Drive!"
[OTH],You give your mommy a kissy.
Cartman,"Drive the car damn-it, drive!"
[OTH],Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
Cartman,"Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing."
[OTH],"Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman."
[OTH],(Maybe she'll suck my dick.)
[OTH],"Oh, ho, that's disgusting."
Cartman,"You piece of crap, I'll kill you!"
[OTH],"That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'."
Cartman,Eeeeenh!
[OTH],"Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber."
[OTH],"Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer."
[OTH],You what?!?
[OTH],"mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm."
[OTH],I like chocolate milk.
[OTH],"Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization."
[OTH],"Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes."
Cartman,"Hey, I didn't get a gun."
Cartman,Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
[OTH],"You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman."
[OTH],Were you stationed in Da Nang?
[OTH],"Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says."
Cartman,"Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off."
[OTH],"Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer."
[OTH],"My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa."
[OTH],"Wow, that'd be cool."
Cartman,My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
[OTH],"Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!"
[OTH],"Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there."
[OTH],"Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting."
Cartman,Democrats piss me off!
[OTH],"They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'"
[OTH],"Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo."
[OTH],"Mmm, Jimbo look, mm."
[OTH],"Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!"
Cartman,Kickass!!
[OTH],"Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck."
[OTH],"Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock."
[OTH],"Let's move, moove!"
[OTH],Is this hunting?
[OTH],I guess so.
Cartman,"Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks."
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,"Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!"
[OTH],This one's yours Stan.
[OTH],It's coming right for us.
[OTH],It's coming right for us.
[OTH],Shoot it Stan.
Cartman,"I got your back, soldier."
[OTH],I can't.
[OTH],What the? What's wrong with you?
[OTH],I don't wanna shoot the bunny.
[OTH],"What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical."
[OTH],"I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny."
[OTH],No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.
Cartman,"Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything."
[OTH],"I can shoot you, fat ass!"
Cartman,I can shoot you too!
[OTH],I'll kill you!
Cartman,I'll fill you full of lead!
[OTH],"Hey, what's that?"
[OTH],What the heck is this?
[OTH],"Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!"
Cartman,My weenies won't cook.
[OTH],"Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm."
[OTH],"Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick."
[OTH],"Mmm, yepper."
[OTH],"Mmm, aahh, oh."
[OTH],"Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?"
[OTH],"Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm."
Cartman,"Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah."
[OTH],"But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?"
[OTH],"We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but..."
[OTH],"Mayor, the geologist is here to see you."
[OTH],My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
[OTH],"No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth."
[OTH],"Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!"
[OTH],"I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker."
[OTH],Just send in the geometrist.
[OTH],Geologist...
[OTH],"You are fired, buddy!"
[OTH],"Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you."
[OTH],"Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt."
[OTH],What does this mean to the town?
[OTH],"Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad."
[OTH],Right now South Park is here.
[OTH],My God!
[OTH],"Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!"
[OTH],"Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there?"
[OTH],"Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted."
[OTH],"Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh. Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control."
[OTH],"And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day."
[OTH],Mmmowwwh.
[OTH],"Hah, got ya."
Cartman,"Heh, tha-that's not scary."
[OTH],You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!
Cartman,"Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!"
[OTH],"Hey Ned, hand me that gin."
[OTH],You boys want to tie one on?
[OTH],"No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee."
[OTH],"Yeah, Cartman's pee."
Cartman,"Hey, you would taste my pee!"
[OTH],What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?
[OTH],"Christ, look at that little bastard go!"
[OTH],"Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!"
[OTH],"Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too."
Cartman,Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!"
Cartman,Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of Scuzzlebutt?
[OTH],Whatabutt?
Cartman,"Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top."
[OTH],Why?
Cartman,"Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body."
[OTH],Deformed how?
Cartman,"Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has..."
[OTH],A hook.
[OTH],A knife.
Cartman,No! A piece of celery.
[OTH],Celery?
Cartman,"Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy."
[OTH],"Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!"
Cartman,"What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink."
[OTH],"Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories."
[OTH],"Yeah, give me that flashlight."
[OTH],"(Hey, what's that?)"
[OTH],What is that?
[OTH],Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Cartman,"Hey, it might be!"
[OTH],"Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand."
Cartman,Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
[OTH],"Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song."
[OTH],"Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah. Mmmoh lord, Kumbayah.
Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah..."
Cartman,They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!
[OTH],"...Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah."
[OTH],"Stan, Stan, wake up!"
[OTH],"What, dude?"
[OTH],I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
[OTH],Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
[OTH],They're out fishing with Kenny.
[OTH],"With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?"
[OTH],"Well Stan, you want to know what I think?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!"
[OTH],"Mmm, got it."
[OTH],Great instincts boy.
[OTH],"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!"
[OTH],Who? The fat kid?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!"
[OTH],"Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit."
[OTH],Moh man it smells like dead fish here.
[OTH],(A little like a vagina.)
[OTH],"Em-moh man, that is nasty."
[OTH],"Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew."
[OTH],(Thanks.)
[OTH],"The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony."
[OTH],Yeahhh.
[OTH],"Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!"
[OTH],"Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?"
[OTH],"All we know right now is that some of our children are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Well you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1 All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids."
[OTH],Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
[OTH],"Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off."
[OTH],"There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on."
[OTH],"Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast."
[OTH],Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.
[OTH],"Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!"
[OTH],"Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun."
[OTH],Look!
Cartman,"I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg."
[OTH],"Mmm, what is it?"
[OTH],"Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying."
[OTH],Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
[OTH],"We'll be on the cover of ""Guns & Ammo""."
[OTH],This calls for some HJ-14.
Cartman,Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
[OTH],Fire in the hoooole!
Cartman,Holy crap!
[OTH],"Damn it, I think I missed."
Cartman,What the hell is wrong with you people?!
[OTH],"C'mon, let's move, move!"
Cartman,"Hey, wait, aah!"
[OTH],"Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!"
[OTH],"Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea."
[OTH],"Huh, what?"
[OTH],"Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely."
[OTH],"And, that would be good? Right?"
[OTH],Uh - pretty sure.
[OTH],"Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!"
[OTH],"These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!! The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe."
[OTH],"Look, up there."
Cartman,"You guys, it's just me."
[OTH],Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?
[OTH],Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?
[OTH],I can't tell; let's kill it!
Cartman,"Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume."
[OTH],"Kenny, you take the front."
[OTH],No!
[OTH],I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
[OTH],"That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!"
Cartman,"You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!"
[OTH],"As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary."
[OTH],"Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please."
[OTH],"Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt."
[OTH],"That's right Jane, duck and cover."
[OTH],So what will you -do when you hear a volcano erupting?
[OTH],"That's right, duck and cover."
[OTH],Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.
[OTH],"OK, any questions?"
[OTH],That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
[OTH],That's enough out of you!
[OTH],I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Cartman,"Hey, seriously you guys!"
[OTH],"Kill it, Stan. Kill it. Come on Stan, kill it."
[OTH],"Ah, damn it, I can't do it!"
[OTH],You pansy! give me that gun.
Cartman,Hey!
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,"Goddammit, don't shoot me!"
[OTH],What the Sam Hell?
Cartman,"I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now."
[OTH],"Mmm, so much for the cover of ""Guns & Ammo""."
[OTH],"Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Mmm, holy crap."
[OTH],The mountain! It's blown it's top!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],"(Nope, I'm okay.)"
[OTH],(It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)
[OTH],(Ugh.)
[OTH],"Look, the volcano."
[OTH],"Quick, duck and cover."
Cartman,Aaaaah!
[OTH],That lava's coming right for us!!
[OTH],"Oh no, look."
[OTH],What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
[OTH],"It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava."
[OTH],"God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-"
Cartman,Help!
[OTH],"Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!"
Cartman,What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
[OTH],Oh my God! Look at his leg!
[OTH],"Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy."
[OTH],"Quick Ned, shoot it!"
[OTH],"Mmmoh no, out of ammo."
[OTH],Grrrr.
[OTH],What... is that thing?
[OTH],That's Scuzzlebutt.
[OTH],"Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets."
[OTH],This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
[OTH],"Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed."
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],"Whoa, he built a wicker basket."
[OTH],"Hey, he's saving us."
[OTH],Grrr.
[OTH],Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
[OTH],And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
[OTH],Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
[OTH],Uhh...
[OTH],Aaaaah.
[OTH],South Park is saved.
[OTH],"Hey look, Kenny's okay."
[OTH],"(Hey guys, what's goin' down?)"
[OTH],And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.
[OTH],"Mmmm
Baby every time that we kiss,
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava,
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat,
Lava so warm and red and wet,
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr."
[OTH],"Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?"
[OTH],"Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt."
[OTH],Friend.
[OTH],"Oh, how sweet."
[OTH],"I did it, I did it, I finally killed something."
[OTH],Oh my God! What has he done?
[OTH],Turn off the cameras!
[OTH],"Hey, that was easy!"
[OTH],Noooo! Why God? Why?!
[OTH],"Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!"
[OTH],What?! Why?!
[OTH],"Yeah, make up your mind, dude!"
[OTH],"Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm."
[OTH],"(Oh, no!)"
[OTH],"But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny."
[OTH],"But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?"
[OTH],"Dude, I don't understand hunting at all."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons."
Cartman,"Yeah, cartoons kick ass!"
[OTH],"Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice."
[OTH],"Hiya, Sparky."
[OTH],Who's that?
[OTH],That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
[OTH],Wow! Cool!
[OTH],"Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?"
Cartman,"Eh. You're making me sick, dude."
[OTH],He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
Cartman,No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
[OTH],Arrrrrr.
[OTH],He's not meaner than Sparky.
Cartman,"Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!"
[OTH],Sparky'll kick his ass.
Cartman,I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
[OTH],"You're on, dude!"
[OTH],"That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!"
Cartman,"Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass."
[OTH],Sparky! Bad dog!
[OTH],"(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)"
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,"Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay."
[OTH],What do you mean?
Cartman,That dog is a gay homosexual.
[OTH],He's just confused.
[OTH],I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
[OTH],"(No, check his penis.)"
[OTH],"Sick, shut up dude!"
Cartman,Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.
[OTH],"Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park."
[OTH],Who's Middle Park?
Cartman,What's homecoming?
[OTH],"But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. Now, let's start practice."
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?"
[OTH],"Yes Pip, what is it?"
[OTH],"Uh, I still don't have a helmet."
[OTH],"I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody."
[OTH],"Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?"
[OTH],"Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Sorry son, now get your ass in there."
[OTH],Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
[OTH],Hike the damn ball!
[OTH],Aaaaaaaargh!
[OTH],"Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef?"
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, fine, fine."
[OTH],I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.
[OTH],Elementary school alumni?
[OTH],That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
[OTH],I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
[OTH],Middle Park by 70 points.
[OTH],Hmmm...
[OTH],I don't think we have a chance.
[OTH],Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Atta boy!
[OTH],"Great pass, Stan!"
[OTH],"Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie!"
[OTH],Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
[OTH],"Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?"
[OTH],"Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart."
[OTH],"Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time."
[OTH],"Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- Sparky, get down!"
[OTH],Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!
Cartman,There he goes again.
[OTH],"Get down, Sparky! Down!"
Cartman,Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
[OTH],Make him stop!
[OTH],Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!
[OTH],I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.
[OTH],"Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan."
[OTH],Gay dog.
Cartman,"...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television."
[OTH],"Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-."
Cartman,"Ah, dammit!"
[OTH],"Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?"
[OTH],"Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next."
[OTH],"Um, I'm not really prepared either."
[OTH],"Well, just make something up, like Eric did."
[OTH],"Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-"
[OTH],Excellent. A-.
Cartman,Eeyy!
[OTH],"Wow, cool!"
Cartman,"Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?"
[OTH],"Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people."
Cartman,That's not fair!
[OTH],"Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it."
Cartman,Stupid puppet.
[OTH],"Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?"
[OTH],"Well of course Stanley, what is it?"
[OTH],What's a... homosexual?
[OTH],"Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down."
[OTH],"Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold, black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?"
[OTH],I guess.
[OTH],"Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual."
Cartman,You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
[OTH],You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Cartman,"Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog."
[OTH],"Shut up, dude!"
[OTH],"Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?"
[OTH],"Bark, bark."
Cartman,"Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen."
[OTH],"He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky."
[OTH],"Good boy, now shake."
[OTH],"Good boy. Now, don't be gay."
[OTH],"Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay."
[OTH],Did it work?
[OTH],I don't know.
Cartman,He still looks pretty gay to me.
[OTH],"Huh, huh."
[OTH],"Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?"
[OTH],"Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbra Streisand concert. Stupid little gay dog."
[OTH],Gay dog.
[OTH],"Come on you guys, I have an idea."
[OTH],I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
[OTH],Are you crazy?
[OTH],"No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread."
[OTH],I want to put all my money on the Cows.
[OTH],"Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it."
[OTH],"Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too."
[OTH],I got 500 on the Cows.
[OTH],"Well, I'll put my money on the Cows."
[OTH],"Whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now uh..."
[OTH],"You better be right about this, Jimbo."
[OTH],"Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself."
[OTH],Are you sure Stan is that good?
[OTH],"Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?"
[OTH],You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.
[OTH],I love that song.
[OTH],"'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget."
[OTH],"Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-"
[OTH],"Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!"
[OTH],"No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi."
[OTH],Ooh-la-la.
Cartman,There he goes!
[OTH],"Atta boy, Spark! Get her!"
[OTH],Yes!
[OTH],Ah crap! Now what do I do?
[OTH],Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
Cartman,"No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France."
[OTH],(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
[OTH],"I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil."
[OTH],"Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else."
[OTH],Like who?
[OTH],And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.
[OTH],"Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air."
[OTH],"Yeah, is- is this Jesus?"
[OTH],Yes my son.
[OTH],"This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife."
[OTH],Of course Robert. How are things now?
[OTH],"Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins too, that was really nice of you."
[OTH],"Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air."
[OTH],"Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual."
[OTH],"My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-"
[OTH],"That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews."
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],What'd he say?
[OTH],I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Cartman,"Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!"
[OTH],Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
[OTH],"Come on dude, we have to get to practice."
[OTH],"No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!"
[OTH],I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!
[OTH],"Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover. Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm."
[OTH],"Uh, Chef?"
[OTH],"Spank it, ever so gently."
[OTH],Chef.
[OTH],Spank it.
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],"Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays."
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Chef sir?"
[OTH],"No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you."
[OTH],"Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?"
[OTH],"That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?"
[OTH],"No um, I guess not."
[OTH],"What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime."
[OTH],What moment would that be?
[OTH],"Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F."
[OTH],What high F?
[OTH],"You know, 
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah."
[OTH],"Right, right, so you want the trigger on the doo-nn-doo?"
[OTH],"No, dammit! The aaaaah!"
[OTH],Aaaaahh?
[OTH],Aaaaahh.
[OTH],Aaaaahh!
[OTH],Aaaaahh.
[OTH],Great.
[OTH],Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo - Aaah.
[OTH],Doo-nn-doo-doo
[OTH],You got it.
[OTH],Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...
[OTH],Aaa - dooo...
[OTH],Aaaaahh!
[OTH],"Alright, yeah, okay..."
[OTH],"What's the matter, Stan? You seem down."
[OTH],"I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay."
[OTH],"Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks."
[OTH],"Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda."
[OTH],Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Well, you're gay aren't you?"
[OTH],What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
[OTH],"Well, you sure do act like it."
[OTH],"I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass."
[OTH],What's the matter dude?
[OTH],I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Cartman,Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. Ow!
[OTH],"Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al."
[OTH],Have you been outcast?
[OTH],"Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?"
[OTH],"Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here."
[OTH],"Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back."
[OTH],"Wow, it's been like two days."
[OTH],I think he might've run away.
Cartman,Did you check the shopping ma- Ow!
[OTH],"We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan."
[OTH],I'm not playing.
[OTH],You what?!
[OTH],I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog.
[OTH],"Come on Ned, and keep quiet."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Hello there, Enrique."
[OTH],What are we doing here?
[OTH],"Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead."
[OTH],"And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in ""Loving You"", BOOM!"
[OTH],No more Middle Park players!
[OTH],"God damn, I love football!"
[OTH],Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
[OTH],Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!
[OTH],"Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows."
[OTH],"Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up."
[OTH],"Oohh, come on, Stan..."
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?"
[OTH],"No Pip, I'm sorry!"
[OTH],Sparky! Sparky!
[OTH],Play ball.
[OTH],"You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle."
[OTH],But I never practiced quarterback.
[OTH],Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now.
[OTH],"Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski."
[OTH],"Hey hey, where is little Stanley?"
[OTH],"Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?"
[OTH],"Ned, look!"
[OTH],"They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached."
[OTH],Yay.
[OTH],"Hi little fella, how are you doing today?"
[OTH],"Fine, how are you?"
[OTH],"I'm super, thanks for asking."
[OTH],My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
[OTH],"Well, let's see. Come on in."
[OTH],Do you have lots of gay dogs here?
[OTH],We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.
[OTH],Rooaar.
[OTH],"And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!"
[OTH],"Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy."
[OTH],"Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance?"
[OTH],"Oww, we can both be gay!"
[OTH],"Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?!"
[OTH],Break!
[OTH],You guys are toast.
[OTH],"Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in."
Cartman,We'll just see about that.
[OTH],"Set, set."
[OTH],Damn it Cartman!
[OTH],What's the matter?
[OTH],Cartman farted!
Cartman,No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
[OTH],Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
[OTH],No way dude!
[OTH],Hike! The! Ball!
[OTH],"Ah, dude, weak."
Cartman,"That's right, you get back there."
[OTH],Hike!
[OTH],Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes!
[OTH],"Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter."
[OTH],Hell's bells.
[OTH],"Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King."
[OTH],"Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again."
[OTH],"Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that."
[OTH],"We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo."
[OTH],"Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh."
[OTH],...both be gay.
[OTH],"Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?"
[OTH],Ruff.
[OTH],"I missed you old pal, you really had me scared."
[OTH],Barr.
[OTH],"Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game."
[OTH],We can work on making you not gay together.
[OTH],Sparky?
[OTH],"Young man, it appears you still don't understand."
[OTH],What don't I understand?
[OTH],"Come this way, I have to show you something."
[OTH],"With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0."
[OTH],"Hut, hut."
[OTH],"Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant."
[OTH],Dude! Now that is not cool.
[OTH],"Sorry, sorry."
[OTH],"Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride."
[OTH],"Step aboard, Stanley."
[OTH],"Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time."
[OTH],And the South Park Cows are set to receive...
[OTH],"There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick."
[OTH],"He's at the 50, the 40, the 30."
[OTH],"Hold him, hold him!"
[OTH],"Hold him, hold him!"
[OTH],Yaaah!
[OTH],The little running back is down. I think he's...
[OTH],"Yes, he's been decapitated."
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!"
[OTH],"Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank."
[OTH],Ouch-a-roo!
[OTH],"Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field!"
[OTH],"Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot."
[OTH],"You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan."
[OTH],"Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!"
[OTH],"Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely."
[OTH],"We're all gay, and it's okay,
'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.
We're not sad anymore, cause we're out the closet door.
It's okay, hey, to be gay!"
[OTH],"Sooo, what do you think, Stan?"
[OTH],"This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand."
[OTH],Isn't this precious?
[OTH],"And now, here to sing the touching song Loving You, is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother..."
[OTH],Alright Richard!
[OTH],"Loving you,
is easy cause you're beautiful,
-doo-n-doo-n-doo-doooo-
Aaaaah!"
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],What the hell?!
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],He didn't sing the high F!
[OTH],"Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this."
[OTH],Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked.
[OTH],Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala la la lala...
[OTH],It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
[OTH],"Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!"
[OTH],Ruff!
[OTH],"No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?"
[OTH],"No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!"
[OTH],Oh Stan?
[OTH],"When you get back to town, tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately."
[OTH],"I will Big Gay Al, I will."
[OTH],"Ooh, my carrot cake!"
[OTH],Hike!
[OTH],And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since...
[OTH],"I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo."
[OTH],"Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game."
[OTH],"You're a dead man, Jimbo!"
[OTH],"Well, this should just about wrap it up for-"
[OTH],"Wait a minute, what's this?"
[OTH],Yeah! Yohooooh!
[OTH],"It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback!"
[OTH],Where the hell have you been Stan?!
[OTH],I've been getting my best friend back.
[OTH],Just get in there boy!
[OTH],"Give 'em hell, Stanley!"
[OTH],"Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?"
[OTH],Leave me alone.
[OTH],Hike!
[OTH],Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.
[OTH],"Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think!"
[OTH],Mph!
[OTH],"And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid!"
[OTH],Oof.
[OTH],"Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],Touchdown!
[OTH],Yeah! Wooo!
[OTH],"The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread!"
[OTH],Yeah! Woohoo!
[OTH],Speech!
[OTH],"Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?"
[OTH],Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
[OTH],"Yeah, alright!"
[OTH],And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!
[OTH],Wooooh!
[OTH],And it's okay to be gay!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing."
[OTH],What the hell is he talking about?
[OTH],"Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?"
[OTH],"I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety."
[OTH],"It's true, I'll show you."
[OTH],But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...
Cartman,"Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man."
[OTH],Oliver! I thought you ran away all those months ago!
[OTH],Sidney!
[OTH],Willy!
[OTH],Carlos!
[OTH],I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.
[OTH],"Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?"
[OTH],"I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done."
[OTH],"Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"You guys, you guys! I can do it."
[OTH],Do what?
[OTH],"Loving you,
Is easy cause you're beautiful,
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Mroo-
[OTH],"Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice."
[OTH],"Hiya, Sparky."
[OTH],Who's that?
[OTH],That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
[OTH],Wow! Cool!
[OTH],"Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?"
Cartman,"Eh. You're making me sick, dude."
[OTH],He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
Cartman,No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
[OTH],Arrrrrr.
[OTH],He's not meaner than Sparky.
Cartman,"Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!"
[OTH],Sparky'll kick his ass.
Cartman,I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
[OTH],"You're on, dude!"
[OTH],"That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!"
Cartman,"Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass."
[OTH],Sparky! Bad dog!
[OTH],"(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)"
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,"Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay."
[OTH],What do you mean?
Cartman,That dog is a gay homosexual.
[OTH],He's just confused.
[OTH],I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
[OTH],"(No, check his penis.)"
[OTH],"Sick, shut up dude!"
Cartman,Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.
[OTH],"Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park."
[OTH],Who's Middle Park?
Cartman,What's homecoming?
[OTH],"But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. Now, let's start practice."
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?"
[OTH],"Yes Pip, what is it?"
[OTH],"Uh, I still don't have a helmet."
[OTH],"I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody."
[OTH],"Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?"
[OTH],"Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Sorry son, now get your ass in there."
[OTH],Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
[OTH],Hike the damn ball!
[OTH],Aaaaaaaargh!
[OTH],"Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef?"
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, fine, fine."
[OTH],I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.
[OTH],Elementary school alumni?
[OTH],That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
[OTH],I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
[OTH],Middle Park by 70 points.
[OTH],Hmmm...
[OTH],I don't think we have a chance.
[OTH],Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Atta boy!
[OTH],"Great pass, Stan!"
[OTH],"Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie!"
[OTH],Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
[OTH],"Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?"
[OTH],"Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart."
[OTH],"Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time."
[OTH],"Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- Sparky, get down!"
[OTH],Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!
Cartman,There he goes again.
[OTH],"Get down, Sparky! Down!"
Cartman,Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
[OTH],Make him stop!
[OTH],Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!
[OTH],I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.
[OTH],"Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan."
[OTH],Gay dog.
Cartman,"...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television."
[OTH],"Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-."
Cartman,"Ah, dammit!"
[OTH],"Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?"
[OTH],"Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next."
[OTH],"Um, I'm not really prepared either."
[OTH],"Well, just make something up, like Eric did."
[OTH],"Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-"
[OTH],Excellent. A-.
Cartman,Eeyy!
[OTH],"Wow, cool!"
Cartman,"Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?"
[OTH],"Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people."
Cartman,That's not fair!
[OTH],"Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it."
Cartman,Stupid puppet.
[OTH],"Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?"
[OTH],"Well of course Stanley, what is it?"
[OTH],What's a... homosexual?
[OTH],"Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down."
[OTH],"Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold, black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?"
[OTH],I guess.
[OTH],"Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual."
Cartman,You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
[OTH],You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Cartman,"Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog."
[OTH],"Shut up, dude!"
[OTH],"Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?"
[OTH],"Bark, bark."
Cartman,"Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen."
[OTH],"He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky."
[OTH],"Good boy, now shake."
[OTH],"Good boy. Now, don't be gay."
[OTH],"Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay."
[OTH],Did it work?
[OTH],I don't know.
Cartman,He still looks pretty gay to me.
[OTH],"Huh, huh."
[OTH],"Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?"
[OTH],"Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbra Streisand concert. Stupid little gay dog."
[OTH],Gay dog.
[OTH],"Come on you guys, I have an idea."
[OTH],I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
[OTH],Are you crazy?
[OTH],"No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread."
[OTH],I want to put all my money on the Cows.
[OTH],"Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it."
[OTH],"Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too."
[OTH],I got 500 on the Cows.
[OTH],"Well, I'll put my money on the Cows."
[OTH],"Whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now uh..."
[OTH],"You better be right about this, Jimbo."
[OTH],"Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself."
[OTH],Are you sure Stan is that good?
[OTH],"Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?"
[OTH],You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.
[OTH],I love that song.
[OTH],"'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget."
[OTH],"Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-"
[OTH],"Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!"
[OTH],"No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi."
[OTH],Ooh-la-la.
Cartman,There he goes!
[OTH],"Atta boy, Spark! Get her!"
[OTH],Yes!
[OTH],Ah crap! Now what do I do?
[OTH],Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
Cartman,"No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France."
[OTH],(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
[OTH],"I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil."
[OTH],"Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else."
[OTH],Like who?
[OTH],And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.
[OTH],"Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air."
[OTH],"Yeah, is- is this Jesus?"
[OTH],Yes my son.
[OTH],"This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife."
[OTH],Of course Robert. How are things now?
[OTH],"Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins too, that was really nice of you."
[OTH],"Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air."
[OTH],"Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual."
[OTH],"My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-"
[OTH],"That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews."
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],What'd he say?
[OTH],I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Cartman,"Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!"
[OTH],Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
[OTH],"Come on dude, we have to get to practice."
[OTH],"No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!"
[OTH],I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!
[OTH],"Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover. Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm."
[OTH],"Uh, Chef?"
[OTH],"Spank it, ever so gently."
[OTH],Chef.
[OTH],Spank it.
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],"Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays."
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Chef sir?"
[OTH],"No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you."
[OTH],"Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?"
[OTH],"That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?"
[OTH],"No um, I guess not."
[OTH],"What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime."
[OTH],What moment would that be?
[OTH],"Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F."
[OTH],What high F?
[OTH],"You know, 
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah."
[OTH],"Right, right, so you want the trigger on the doo-nn-doo?"
[OTH],"No, dammit! The aaaaah!"
[OTH],Aaaaahh?
[OTH],Aaaaahh.
[OTH],Aaaaahh!
[OTH],Aaaaahh.
[OTH],Great.
[OTH],Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo - Aaah.
[OTH],Doo-nn-doo-doo
[OTH],You got it.
[OTH],Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...
[OTH],Aaa - dooo...
[OTH],Aaaaahh!
[OTH],"Alright, yeah, okay..."
[OTH],"What's the matter, Stan? You seem down."
[OTH],"I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay."
[OTH],"Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks."
[OTH],"Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda."
[OTH],Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Well, you're gay aren't you?"
[OTH],What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
[OTH],"Well, you sure do act like it."
[OTH],"I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass."
[OTH],What's the matter dude?
[OTH],I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Cartman,Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. Ow!
[OTH],"Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al."
[OTH],Have you been outcast?
[OTH],"Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?"
[OTH],"Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here."
[OTH],"Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back."
[OTH],"Wow, it's been like two days."
[OTH],I think he might've run away.
Cartman,Did you check the shopping ma- Ow!
[OTH],"We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan."
[OTH],I'm not playing.
[OTH],You what?!
[OTH],I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog.
[OTH],"Come on Ned, and keep quiet."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Hello there, Enrique."
[OTH],What are we doing here?
[OTH],"Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead."
[OTH],"And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in ""Loving You"", BOOM!"
[OTH],No more Middle Park players!
[OTH],"God damn, I love football!"
[OTH],Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
[OTH],Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!
[OTH],"Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows."
[OTH],"Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up."
[OTH],"Oohh, come on, Stan..."
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?"
[OTH],"No Pip, I'm sorry!"
[OTH],Sparky! Sparky!
[OTH],Play ball.
[OTH],"You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle."
[OTH],But I never practiced quarterback.
[OTH],Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now.
[OTH],"Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski."
[OTH],"Hey hey, where is little Stanley?"
[OTH],"Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?"
[OTH],"Ned, look!"
[OTH],"They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached."
[OTH],Yay.
[OTH],"Hi little fella, how are you doing today?"
[OTH],"Fine, how are you?"
[OTH],"I'm super, thanks for asking."
[OTH],My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
[OTH],"Well, let's see. Come on in."
[OTH],Do you have lots of gay dogs here?
[OTH],We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.
[OTH],Rooaar.
[OTH],"And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!"
[OTH],"Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy."
[OTH],"Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance?"
[OTH],"Oww, we can both be gay!"
[OTH],"Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?!"
[OTH],Break!
[OTH],You guys are toast.
[OTH],"Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in."
Cartman,We'll just see about that.
[OTH],"Set, set."
[OTH],Damn it Cartman!
[OTH],What's the matter?
[OTH],Cartman farted!
Cartman,No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
[OTH],Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
[OTH],No way dude!
[OTH],Hike! The! Ball!
[OTH],"Ah, dude, weak."
Cartman,"That's right, you get back there."
[OTH],Hike!
[OTH],Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes!
[OTH],"Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter."
[OTH],Hell's bells.
[OTH],"Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King."
[OTH],"Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again."
[OTH],"Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that."
[OTH],"We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo."
[OTH],"Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh."
[OTH],...both be gay.
[OTH],"Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?"
[OTH],Ruff.
[OTH],"I missed you old pal, you really had me scared."
[OTH],Barr.
[OTH],"Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game."
[OTH],We can work on making you not gay together.
[OTH],Sparky?
[OTH],"Young man, it appears you still don't understand."
[OTH],What don't I understand?
[OTH],"Come this way, I have to show you something."
[OTH],"With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0."
[OTH],"Hut, hut."
[OTH],"Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant."
[OTH],Dude! Now that is not cool.
[OTH],"Sorry, sorry."
[OTH],"Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride."
[OTH],"Step aboard, Stanley."
[OTH],"Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time."
[OTH],And the South Park Cows are set to receive...
[OTH],"There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick."
[OTH],"He's at the 50, the 40, the 30."
[OTH],"Hold him, hold him!"
[OTH],"Hold him, hold him!"
[OTH],Yaaah!
[OTH],The little running back is down. I think he's...
[OTH],"Yes, he's been decapitated."
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!"
[OTH],"Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank."
[OTH],Ouch-a-roo!
[OTH],"Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field!"
[OTH],"Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot."
[OTH],"You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan."
[OTH],"Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!"
[OTH],"Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely."
[OTH],"We're all gay, and it's okay,
'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.
We're not sad anymore, cause we're out the closet door.
It's okay, hey, to be gay!"
[OTH],"Sooo, what do you think, Stan?"
[OTH],"This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand."
[OTH],Isn't this precious?
[OTH],"And now, here to sing the touching song Loving You, is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother..."
[OTH],Alright Richard!
[OTH],"Loving you,
is easy cause you're beautiful,
-doo-n-doo-n-doo-doooo-
Aaaaah!"
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],What the hell?!
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],He didn't sing the high F!
[OTH],"Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this."
[OTH],Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked.
[OTH],Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala la la lala...
[OTH],It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
[OTH],"Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!"
[OTH],Ruff!
[OTH],"No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?"
[OTH],"No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!"
[OTH],Oh Stan?
[OTH],"When you get back to town, tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately."
[OTH],"I will Big Gay Al, I will."
[OTH],"Ooh, my carrot cake!"
[OTH],Hike!
[OTH],And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since...
[OTH],"I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo."
[OTH],"Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game."
[OTH],"You're a dead man, Jimbo!"
[OTH],"Well, this should just about wrap it up for-"
[OTH],"Wait a minute, what's this?"
[OTH],Yeah! Yohooooh!
[OTH],"It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback!"
[OTH],Where the hell have you been Stan?!
[OTH],I've been getting my best friend back.
[OTH],Just get in there boy!
[OTH],"Give 'em hell, Stanley!"
[OTH],"Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?"
[OTH],Leave me alone.
[OTH],Hike!
[OTH],Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.
[OTH],"Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think!"
[OTH],Mph!
[OTH],"And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid!"
[OTH],Oof.
[OTH],"Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],Touchdown!
[OTH],Yeah! Wooo!
[OTH],"The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread!"
[OTH],Yeah! Woohoo!
[OTH],Speech!
[OTH],"Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?"
[OTH],Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
[OTH],"Yeah, alright!"
[OTH],And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!
[OTH],Wooooh!
[OTH],And it's okay to be gay!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing."
[OTH],What the hell is he talking about?
[OTH],"Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?"
[OTH],"I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety."
[OTH],"It's true, I'll show you."
[OTH],But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...
Cartman,"Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man."
[OTH],Oliver! I thought you ran away all those months ago!
[OTH],Sidney!
[OTH],Willy!
[OTH],Carlos!
[OTH],I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.
[OTH],"Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?"
[OTH],"I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done."
[OTH],"Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"You guys, you guys! I can do it."
[OTH],Do what?
[OTH],"Loving you,
Is easy cause you're beautiful,
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Mroo-
Cartman,"Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?"
[OTH],"Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere."
Cartman,"Your sister beat you up again, huh?"
[OTH],No!
Cartman,"Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass."
[OTH],She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.
[OTH],"Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan."
Cartman,"I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"""
[OTH],"My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!"
Cartman,"Be a man Stan. Just say, ""Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."""
[OTH],"Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?"
[OTH],You mean this one?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],He's my new pet elephant.
[OTH],Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?
[OTH],"I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three."
[OTH],"Wow, that's cool!"
[OTH],"No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch."
Cartman,That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.
[OTH],"(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)"
[OTH],"Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants."
[OTH],Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing?
[OTH],"Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid."
[OTH],Oh—I'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus.
[OTH],"Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya."
Cartman,"If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-"""
[OTH],SIT DOWN KID!!!
Cartman,Yes ma'am.
[OTH],"And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering."
[OTH],"That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better."
[OTH],Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],Yes Kyle.
[OTH],"With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?"
[OTH],"Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes."
[OTH],That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants.
[OTH],"They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs."
[OTH],That'd be cool!
[OTH],I want a pot-bellied elephant.
[OTH],"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
[OTH],That's stupid.
[OTH],"Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want."
[OTH],"Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig."
[OTH],I'll bet you can't.
[OTH],Watch me plebeian.
[OTH],"Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war."
[OTH],"Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people."
[OTH],"You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month."
[OTH],Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet!
[OTH],"Wait, wait. We still need a pig."
[OTH],We can use Cartman's pig.
Cartman,"Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!"
[OTH],"We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood."
Cartman,"You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!"
[OTH],"Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?
[OTH],Yes...
[OTH],"Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it."
[OTH],"I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?"
[OTH],"Oh, neither. It's my sister."
[OTH],"Your sister?! Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!"
[OTH],Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions...
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],"Yeah, is this Jesus?"
[OTH],"Yes, my son."
[OTH],Hi Shelly.
[OTH],Are you looking at my headgear?
[OTH],Headgear? What headgear?
[OTH],Are you looking at my headgear?
[OTH],"Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice."
[OTH],You little liar.
[OTH],"No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH!"
[OTH],Ready to go Stan?
[OTH],Go where?
[OTH],To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
[OTH],We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
Cartman,Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
[OTH],I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!
[OTH],Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
Cartman,"Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, ""Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"""
[OTH],Who said that?
[OTH],This must be it.
Cartman,"Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time."
[OTH],"No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together."
Cartman,"It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you."
[OTH],It's just a stupid pig.
[OTH],"Yeah, quit being such a baby."
Cartman,"Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!"
[OTH],At least I'm not a little pig-fucker!
Cartman,Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.
[OTH],"What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!"
Cartman,Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
[OTH],"There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!"
Cartman,I'll kick you in the nuts!
[OTH],Can I help you?
[OTH],Mmmmmm!
[OTH],Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
[OTH],"Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs."
[OTH],"No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets."
[OTH],"Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in."
[OTH],I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
Cartman,"Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you."
[OTH],"It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses."
[OTH],Mhhh.
[OTH],How does that make the world better?
[OTH],"And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose."
[OTH],Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
[OTH],"Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish."
Cartman,"Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings."
[OTH],"And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard."
[OTH],"Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?"
[OTH],"Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?"
[OTH],Which song is that?
[OTH],"Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!


Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours."
Cartman,You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
[OTH],"You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days."
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Hmm? What? Oh, excuse me."
[OTH],"Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?"
[OTH],"Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I have some hair please?"
[OTH],Watch out Stan! Genetic engineers are crazy.
Cartman,Come on Fluffy!
[OTH],This fish is just hurting my anus.
[OTH],"Naw, it's pretty fresh."
Cartman,UUuuhh. I sure am hungry.
[OTH],"'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?"
[OTH],"Lunchy munchies, hmmm?"
Cartman,"Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!"
[OTH],"Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!"
[OTH],"Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue..."
Cartman,"God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass."
[OTH],"Yeah! Go away, Pip!"
[OTH],Righto.
Cartman,"Gah, French people piss me off."
[OTH],Hey dumb-asses. You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?
[OTH],No! We're already halfway done.
[OTH],Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.
[OTH],"Yeah, it's probably a gay pig too."
[OTH],Stupid gay pig.
[OTH],It's more than you've got!
[OTH],Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way.
[OTH],Oh my God! They cloned a foot.
Cartman,Ugh!... Hey! I'll kick your ass!
[OTH],Eho!
[OTH],"By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being. Good luck with your stupid little pig."
[OTH],Hello there children.
[OTH],Hey Chef.
[OTH],How you doin'?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice."
[OTH],"Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?"
[OTH],"Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't...


A pig-elephant. Say, now that's not a bad idea."
[OTH],I told you guys.
[OTH],"Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house. Children, we could make a fortune with this."
[OTH],You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!
[OTH],"Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love."
Cartman,Whaaat?!
[OTH],I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
Cartman,I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
[OTH],Sure they would. But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.
[OTH],So how do we do that?
[OTH],"Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk."
[OTH],"Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?"
[OTH],"We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk."
[OTH],"Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?"
Cartman,Why? Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
[OTH],Shut up Cartman!
[OTH],(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
[OTH],"Yeah Stan, she's just a girl."
Cartman,"Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, ""hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"""
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!"
Cartman,"I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all."
[OTH],"Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly. The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, ""Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."""
[OTH],"(""And I want to see you handling your breasts."")"
[OTH],"Sick dude, she's my sister."
[OTH],"Try it. We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig."
Cartman,"No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig! You leave Fluffy out of this!"
[OTH],Come on Kenny.
Cartman,"Kyle no, seriously. No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I... Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts."
[OTH],Crap.
[OTH],And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park Public Access...
[OTH],Are you staring at my neck-brace?
[OTH],"No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neck-brace?"
[OTH],"Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that... that you're my sister, and I love you."
[OTH],"No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me."
[OTH],You'll never be bigger than me Stan. Never!
[OTH],"Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful. My son, I think we've finally done it."
[OTH],"Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone."
[OTH],Hopefully not a gay clone.
[OTH],"Yeah, that was stupid."
[OTH],Stupid.
[OTH],That was stupid.
[OTH],"Come on elephant, keep drinking."
[OTH],"Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig."
[OTH],Dammit! This is never gonna work.
[OTH],Hello children. I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
[OTH],"Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex."
[OTH],"Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood."
[OTH],"Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.

Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!"
[OTH],"Oooo tonight
Oooo it's all right
Oooo tonight is right for love, love gravy."
[OTH],Thank you Elton.
[OTH],"Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay."
[OTH],Hey look! It's working.
[OTH],"Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life. The beauty of Mother Nature."
[OTH],Aah!
[OTH],Sick!
Cartman,Fluffy!
[OTH],"Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt."
[OTH],"How luscious. Our creature has come to fruition, boys."
[OTH],"Dad, you're the best."
[OTH],"Oh my God! He only has one ass. He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room."
[OTH],"Oh no, this entire experiment is turning out very bad."
[OTH],Me bad??
[OTH],"Eeegads, he's out of control. We'll have to destroy him."
[OTH],But he's our science fair project!
[OTH],"Uhhh, me baad, aba-ba-chewy-chomp."
[OTH],He's too dangerous son.
[OTH],But dad! I want a human clone.
[OTH],"Son, no."
[OTH],"Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake. You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy."
[OTH],"They're all stupid anyway. Come on guys, let's go."
[OTH],"Yeahh, they're all gay."
[OTH],Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
[OTH],"Oh, they will. It's gonna be one uuuugly sight."
[OTH],I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
[OTH],"Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?"
[OTH],"Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children."
[OTH],"Uh oh, here we go."
[OTH],"Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig."
[OTH],Or a big fat elephant.
[OTH],"Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?"
[OTH],"Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days."
[OTH],Couple of days? But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
Cartman,"Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?"
Cartman,Hey!
[OTH],"Oh thank Buddha I found you boys. You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately?"
[OTH],"Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig."
[OTH],"No, no, I said odd."
[OTH],"Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill."
[OTH],"Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy... then... uhhhhh... hmmm... oh, nevermind. I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch. You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free."
[OTH],(A big mutant Stan?!)
[OTH],A big mutant version of me?
[OTH],Is he bigger than a regular clone?
[OTH],He's terribly dangerous. His brain is identical to yours. I need you to help me find him.
[OTH],Ah chewy-chewy-chomp.
[OTH],Oh my Gooodd!
[OTH],"Stan, are you wearing a different hat?"
[OTH],Uhhhyahhuhhh.
[OTH],"Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention."
[OTH],Aaaaaah!
[OTH],Ooooh.
[OTH],How big do you think he is?
[OTH],I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
[OTH],"Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?"
[OTH],(Look at that! What's he doin'?)
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],"It appears that the horrible, destructive creature is actually eight-year old Stan Marsh of South Park. When asked why he was wreaking so much havoc on his home town, the little boy replies simply, ""Me Stan, ba-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp. Back to you in the studio."
[OTH],"Thanks Tom, police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year old boy you immediately kill him and burn his body. That's all for now."
[OTH],Now back to Jesus and Pals.
[OTH],"-- Yea, the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and-"
[OTH],Ba-ba-chomp-betchaba-chewy-chewy-chomp-aaah.
[OTH],Jesus!
[OTH],its-to-the-left-mayoueyea.
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town. We have to find him."
[OTH],"You boys have been watching the ""X-Files"" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -"
[OTH],Ahhhh.
[OTH],"Whoa! Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here."
[OTH],"Come on, let's go!"
[OTH],"There you are! Stanley, you tore up my entire gun shop, you better have a good explanation for this mister!"
[OTH],"It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone."
[OTH],"Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?! You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!"
[OTH],I'm gonna go have a word with your father Stanley.
[OTH],"Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this."
[OTH],"Wait, Stan, there he goes."
[OTH],Stop!
[OTH],"Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp?"
[OTH],He recognizes you dude.
[OTH],"That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down."
[OTH],"Ba-chomp, eh mee ahh jaran."
[OTH],What should we do with him?
[OTH],"Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?"
[OTH],"Ahhhh, yeahhh."
[OTH],"...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelly, kick her ass. Shelly bad, Shelly very bad."
[OTH],Me bad??
[OTH],"No! Shelly bad, you good."
[OTH],"He's tearing up the house, stop him!"
[OTH],"Come on Kyle, Cartman."
[OTH],Ah.
[OTH],What the hell do you want?
[OTH],Chewy-chewy-chomp.
[OTH],Ahhh. Uhhh.
[OTH],"Boys! Boys, I'm lusciously sorry for everything."
[OTH],"Hey, they've got our clone. He belongs to us."
[OTH],"No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere. Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such - inconvenience. I tried to play God, and I failed."
[OTH],Daddy! Nooooo!
[OTH],"All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed. Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations. Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics."
[OTH],"You cheating bastards. This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow."
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!"
[OTH],"Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me."
Cartman,I ain't helpin' crap! I want to eat some paeh.
[OTH],You can't just leave me here alone.
Cartman,"Oh yeah, watch me."
[OTH],"Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not. See ya."
[OTH],Thanks a lot.
[OTH],"Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now."
[OTH],It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! Mom and dad are gonna send me away! I don't want to be sent away! I want to stay here! Eehhhehehe!
[OTH],"Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?"
[OTH],Everybody in town is upset with you young man. What's going on? Are you on drugs?
[OTH],It's not Stan's fault.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"It wasn't Stan, he was... he was with me the whole time."
[OTH],"Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions."
[OTH],"Oh honey, please forgive us son."
[OTH],"Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together."
[OTH],"Uh, ahh, oooh."
[OTH],"Everyone, let's give Casey and his weed a big hand."
[OTH],"Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project."
[OTH],"Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now."
[OTH],"Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'. Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project."
[OTH],"Thank you Mr. Garrison. Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man. I present to you, the five-assed monkey."
[OTH],Ahhheh.
[OTH],"Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful."
[OTH],"Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth. It, it had a baby!"
[OTH],It had a baby?
[OTH],Oh wow!
[OTH],What's it look like?
[OTH],"Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?"
Cartman,"Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence? Hmm, what are the odds of that?"
[OTH],Hmmm. You boys get first prize.
Cartman,That'll do pig.
Cartman,"Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?"
[OTH],"Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere."
Cartman,"Your sister beat you up again, huh?"
[OTH],No!
Cartman,"Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass."
[OTH],She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.
[OTH],"Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan."
Cartman,"I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"""
[OTH],"My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!"
Cartman,"Be a man Stan. Just say, ""Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."""
[OTH],"Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?"
[OTH],You mean this one?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],He's my new pet elephant.
[OTH],Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?
[OTH],"I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three."
[OTH],"Wow, that's cool!"
[OTH],"No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch."
Cartman,That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.
[OTH],"(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)"
[OTH],"Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants."
[OTH],Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing?
[OTH],"Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid."
[OTH],Oh—I'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus.
[OTH],"Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya."
Cartman,"If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-"""
[OTH],SIT DOWN KID!!!
Cartman,Yes ma'am.
[OTH],"And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering."
[OTH],"That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better."
[OTH],Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],Yes Kyle.
[OTH],"With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?"
[OTH],"Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes."
[OTH],That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants.
[OTH],"They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs."
[OTH],That'd be cool!
[OTH],I want a pot-bellied elephant.
[OTH],"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
[OTH],That's stupid.
[OTH],"Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want."
[OTH],"Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig."
[OTH],I'll bet you can't.
[OTH],Watch me plebeian.
[OTH],"Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war."
[OTH],"Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people."
[OTH],"You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month."
[OTH],Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet!
[OTH],"Wait, wait. We still need a pig."
[OTH],We can use Cartman's pig.
Cartman,"Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!"
[OTH],"We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood."
Cartman,"You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!"
[OTH],"Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?
[OTH],Yes...
[OTH],"Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it."
[OTH],"I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?"
[OTH],"Oh, neither. It's my sister."
[OTH],"Your sister?! Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!"
[OTH],Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions...
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],"Yeah, is this Jesus?"
[OTH],"Yes, my son."
[OTH],Hi Shelly.
[OTH],Are you looking at my headgear?
[OTH],Headgear? What headgear?
[OTH],Are you looking at my headgear?
[OTH],"Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice."
[OTH],You little liar.
[OTH],"No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH!"
[OTH],Ready to go Stan?
[OTH],Go where?
[OTH],To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
[OTH],We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
Cartman,Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
[OTH],I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!
[OTH],Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
Cartman,"Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, ""Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"""
[OTH],Who said that?
[OTH],This must be it.
Cartman,"Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time."
[OTH],"No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together."
Cartman,"It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you."
[OTH],It's just a stupid pig.
[OTH],"Yeah, quit being such a baby."
Cartman,"Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!"
[OTH],At least I'm not a little pig-fucker!
Cartman,Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.
[OTH],"What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!"
Cartman,Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
[OTH],"There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!"
Cartman,I'll kick you in the nuts!
[OTH],Can I help you?
[OTH],Mmmmmm!
[OTH],Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
[OTH],"Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs."
[OTH],"No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets."
[OTH],"Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in."
[OTH],I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
Cartman,"Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you."
[OTH],"It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses."
[OTH],Mhhh.
[OTH],How does that make the world better?
[OTH],"And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose."
[OTH],Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
[OTH],"Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish."
Cartman,"Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings."
[OTH],"And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard."
[OTH],"Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?"
[OTH],"Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?"
[OTH],Which song is that?
[OTH],"Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!


Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours."
Cartman,You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
[OTH],"You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days."
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Hmm? What? Oh, excuse me."
[OTH],"Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?"
[OTH],"Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I have some hair please?"
[OTH],Watch out Stan! Genetic engineers are crazy.
Cartman,Come on Fluffy!
[OTH],This fish is just hurting my anus.
[OTH],"Naw, it's pretty fresh."
Cartman,UUuuhh. I sure am hungry.
[OTH],"'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?"
[OTH],"Lunchy munchies, hmmm?"
Cartman,"Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!"
[OTH],"Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!"
[OTH],"Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue..."
Cartman,"God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass."
[OTH],"Yeah! Go away, Pip!"
[OTH],Righto.
Cartman,"Gah, French people piss me off."
[OTH],Hey dumb-asses. You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?
[OTH],No! We're already halfway done.
[OTH],Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.
[OTH],"Yeah, it's probably a gay pig too."
[OTH],Stupid gay pig.
[OTH],It's more than you've got!
[OTH],Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way.
[OTH],Oh my God! They cloned a foot.
Cartman,Ugh!... Hey! I'll kick your ass!
[OTH],Eho!
[OTH],"By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being. Good luck with your stupid little pig."
[OTH],Hello there children.
[OTH],Hey Chef.
[OTH],How you doin'?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice."
[OTH],"Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?"
[OTH],"Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't...


A pig-elephant. Say, now that's not a bad idea."
[OTH],I told you guys.
[OTH],"Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house. Children, we could make a fortune with this."
[OTH],You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!
[OTH],"Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love."
Cartman,Whaaat?!
[OTH],I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
Cartman,I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
[OTH],Sure they would. But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.
[OTH],So how do we do that?
[OTH],"Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk."
[OTH],"Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?"
[OTH],"We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk."
[OTH],"Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?"
Cartman,Why? Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
[OTH],Shut up Cartman!
[OTH],(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
[OTH],"Yeah Stan, she's just a girl."
Cartman,"Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, ""hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"""
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!"
Cartman,"I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all."
[OTH],"Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly. The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, ""Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."""
[OTH],"(""And I want to see you handling your breasts."")"
[OTH],"Sick dude, she's my sister."
[OTH],"Try it. We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig."
Cartman,"No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig! You leave Fluffy out of this!"
[OTH],Come on Kenny.
Cartman,"Kyle no, seriously. No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I... Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts."
[OTH],Crap.
[OTH],And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park Public Access...
[OTH],Are you staring at my neck-brace?
[OTH],"No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neck-brace?"
[OTH],"Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that... that you're my sister, and I love you."
[OTH],"No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me."
[OTH],You'll never be bigger than me Stan. Never!
[OTH],"Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful. My son, I think we've finally done it."
[OTH],"Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone."
[OTH],Hopefully not a gay clone.
[OTH],"Yeah, that was stupid."
[OTH],Stupid.
[OTH],That was stupid.
[OTH],"Come on elephant, keep drinking."
[OTH],"Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig."
[OTH],Dammit! This is never gonna work.
[OTH],Hello children. I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
[OTH],"Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex."
[OTH],"Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood."
[OTH],"Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.

Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.

[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!"
[OTH],"Oooo tonight
Oooo it's all right
Oooo tonight is right for love, love gravy."
[OTH],Thank you Elton.
[OTH],"Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay."
[OTH],Hey look! It's working.
[OTH],"Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life. The beauty of Mother Nature."
[OTH],Aah!
[OTH],Sick!
Cartman,Fluffy!
[OTH],"Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt."
[OTH],"How luscious. Our creature has come to fruition, boys."
[OTH],"Dad, you're the best."
[OTH],"Oh my God! He only has one ass. He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room."
[OTH],"Oh no, this entire experiment is turning out very bad."
[OTH],Me bad??
[OTH],"Eeegads, he's out of control. We'll have to destroy him."
[OTH],But he's our science fair project!
[OTH],"Uhhh, me baad, aba-ba-chewy-chomp."
[OTH],He's too dangerous son.
[OTH],But dad! I want a human clone.
[OTH],"Son, no."
[OTH],"Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake. You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy."
[OTH],"They're all stupid anyway. Come on guys, let's go."
[OTH],"Yeahh, they're all gay."
[OTH],Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
[OTH],"Oh, they will. It's gonna be one uuuugly sight."
[OTH],I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
[OTH],"Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?"
[OTH],"Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children."
[OTH],"Uh oh, here we go."
[OTH],"Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig."
[OTH],Or a big fat elephant.
[OTH],"Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?"
[OTH],"Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days."
[OTH],Couple of days? But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
Cartman,"Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?"
Cartman,Hey!
[OTH],"Oh thank Buddha I found you boys. You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately?"
[OTH],"Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig."
[OTH],"No, no, I said odd."

[OTH],"Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy... then... uhhhhh... hmmm... oh, nevermind. I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch. You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free."
[OTH],(A big mutant Stan?!)
[OTH],A big mutant version of me?
[OTH],Is he bigger than a regular clone?
[OTH],He's terribly dangerous. His brain is identical to yours. I need you to help me find him.
[OTH],Ah chewy-chewy-chomp.
[OTH],Oh my Gooodd!
[OTH],"Stan, are you wearing a different hat?"
[OTH],Uhhhyahhuhhh.
[OTH],"Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention."
[OTH],Aaaaaah!
[OTH],Ooooh.
[OTH],How big do you think he is?
[OTH],I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
[OTH],"Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?"

[OTH],"There you are! Stanley, you tore up my entire gun shop, you better have a good explanation for this mister!"
[OTH],"It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone."
[OTH],"Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?! You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!"
[OTH],I'm gonna go have a word with your father Stanley.
[OTH],"Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this."
[OTH],"Wait, Stan, there he goes."
[OTH],Stop!
[OTH],"Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp?"
[OTH],He recognizes you dude.
[OTH],"That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down."
[OTH],"Ba-chomp, eh mee ahh jaran."
[OTH],What should we do with him?
[OTH],"Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?"
[OTH],"Ahhhh, yeahhh."
[OTH],"...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelly, kick her ass. Shelly bad, Shelly very bad."
[OTH],Me bad??
[OTH],"No! Shelly bad, you good."
[OTH],"He's tearing up the house, stop him!"
[OTH],"Come on Kyle, Cartman."
[OTH],Ah.
[OTH],What the hell do you want?
[OTH],Chewy-chewy-chomp.
[OTH],Ahhh. Uhhh.
[OTH],"Boys! Boys, I'm lusciously sorry for everything."
[OTH],"Hey, they've got our clone. He belongs to us."
[OTH],"No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere. Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such - inconvenience. I tried to play God, and I failed."
[OTH],Daddy! Nooooo!
[OTH],"All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed. Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations. Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics."
[OTH],"You cheating bastards. This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow."
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!"
[OTH],"Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me."
Cartman,I ain't helpin' crap! I want to eat some paeh.
[OTH],You can't just leave me here alone.
Cartman,"Oh yeah, watch me."
[OTH],"Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not. See ya."
[OTH],Thanks a lot.
[OTH],"Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now."
[OTH],It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! Mom and dad are gonna send me away! I don't want to be sent away! I want to stay here! Eehhhehehe!
[OTH],"Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?"
[OTH],Everybody in town is upset with you young man. What's going on? Are you on drugs?
[OTH],It's not Stan's fault.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"It wasn't Stan, he was... he was with me the whole time."
[OTH],"Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions."
[OTH],"Oh honey, please forgive us son."
[OTH],"Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together."
[OTH],"Uh, ahh, oooh."
[OTH],"Everyone, let's give Casey and his weed a big hand."
[OTH],"Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project."
[OTH],"Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now."
[OTH],"Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'. Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project."
[OTH],"Thank you Mr. Garrison. Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man. I present to you, the five-assed monkey."
[OTH],Ahhheh.
[OTH],"Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful."
[OTH],"Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth. It, it had a baby!"
[OTH],It had a baby?
[OTH],Oh wow!
[OTH],What's it look like?
[OTH],"Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?"
Cartman,"Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence? Hmm, what are the odds of that?"
[OTH],Hmmm. You boys get first prize.
Cartman,That'll do pig.
[OTH],"Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear grandpa..."
[OTH],Uhhhhh.
[OTH],...Happy birthday to you.
[OTH],Now blow out the candles grandpa.
[OTH],Hurray!!!
[OTH],"How's it feel to be 102, paps?"
[OTH],Shoot me.
[OTH],Make a wish grandpa.
[OTH],I wish I were dead
[OTH],"Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa."
[OTH],"I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old."
[OTH],"Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?"
[OTH],I will.
[OTH],Me.
[OTH],"It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on."
[OTH],"That show's for babies, it's so stupid."
[OTH],"Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?"
[OTH],"Oh, alright, but take your grandpa with you."
[OTH],"Aw, dammit!"
[OTH],Language.
[OTH],And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
[OTH],"Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart."
[OTH],"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb."
[OTH],Heheheh hehehe...
[OTH],Uhhhhh
[OTH],"Ah, dammit!"
[OTH],How would you like to make a dollar Billy?
[OTH],"My name's not Billy, grandpa. It's Stan."
[OTH],"Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
[OTH],"I'm not gonna kill you, grandpa."
[OTH],Why not?
[OTH],'Cause I'll get in trouble.
[OTH],I killed my grandpa when I was your age.
[OTH],"Leave me alone, grandpa."
[OTH],What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents.
[OTH],"Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too."
[OTH],"Ohhh, you farted."
[OTH],"Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?"
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?"
[OTH],I sure would Terrance.
[OTH],"Alrighty then, here's a two-lip."
[OTH],What is this?
[OTH],It's horrible!
[OTH],"Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip."
[OTH],"Take that, you stupid dick."
[OTH],What did he say?
[OTH],"You're an asshole, Phillip."
[OTH],Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?
[OTH],"Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!"
[OTH],But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
[OTH],Oh really? Is that so?
[OTH],"Oh no, Phillip, looks like you're about to fart."
[OTH],"You're exactly right, Terrance. Oh."
[OTH],Oh no.
Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!"
[OTH],"Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth."
Cartman,That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
[OTH],"Ohhh, okay hon."
[OTH],"I'm not going to kill you, grandpa!"
[OTH],Ingrate!
[OTH],"Good night, grandpa."
[OTH],You pompous son of a whore!
[OTH],"Huh huh, I had another ..."
[OTH],Ow! What the hell was that for?!
Cartman,That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
[OTH],"Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?"
[OTH],Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
Cartman,"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!"
[OTH],Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
Cartman,"Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?"
[OTH],"She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip."
[OTH],"Yeahh, woohoo!"
[OTH],"Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Hat. Shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor'. They don't expand your minds."
[OTH],"You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash."
[OTH],"Kenny, why are you late to class?"
[OTH],"Oh, okay Kenny, be seated."
[OTH],"Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because..."
[OTH],"Yes Kenny, what is it?"
[OTH],(I have to go poop.)
[OTH],I thought you just came from the bathroom.
[OTH],"(I did, I gotta go again...)"
[OTH],"Okay okay, go ahead."
[OTH],"As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment."
[OTH],"Whoa! Smells like you slaughtered a cow in there, Kenny!"
[OTH],Pay attention children!
[OTH],"I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?
[OTH],"That's right, children. Are there any questions?"
[OTH],"Yes, Stanley?"
[OTH],Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
[OTH],"What, what do you mean?"
[OTH],"My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should."
[OTH],"Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna."
[OTH],Really??
[OTH],"Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all."
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,"Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!"
[OTH],"So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],"Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole."
[OTH],(OH MY GOD!)
[OTH],(Owww!)
Cartman,Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.
[OTH],"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late."
[OTH],But won't your grandpa be there?
[OTH],Yeah...
Cartman,"Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money."
[OTH],Hello there children.
[OTH],Hey Chef.
[OTH],How's it goin'?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?"
[OTH],"You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on."
[OTH],"No, I mean, kill my grandpa."
[OTH],"No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal."
[OTH],"See, I told you dude."
[OTH],"Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?"
Cartman,"Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?"
[OTH],I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
[OTH],What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this???
[OTH],And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean.
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, guess what?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Fart.
[OTH],"Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny."
[OTH],"Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh."
[OTH],Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
[OTH],"Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters."
[OTH],"Ha ha, green apple splatters."
[OTH],Uhhhh.
[OTH],"Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay."
[OTH],"Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet."
[OTH],"No grandpa, I'll get in trouble."
[OTH],"Kill me, God dammit!"
[OTH],"No, I can't even kill a deer."
[OTH],"Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?"
Cartman,I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
[OTH],"Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch."
Cartman,What!
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],Grandpa!
[OTH],"And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too."
Cartman,Hey!
[OTH],"Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma."
Cartman,You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
[OTH],"That's the spirit, Tubby."
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman, he's just trying to get to you."
Cartman,Don't talk about my mom like that!
[OTH],We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
[OTH],"I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?"
Cartman,"Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes."
Cartman,"Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang."
[OTH],"I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die."
[OTH],"I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance."
[OTH],"Hey, yeah!"
[OTH],"And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access."
[OTH],"Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace."
[OTH],"First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'."
[OTH],"Yeah, is this Jesus?"
[OTH],"Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback."
[OTH],"Oh, sorry."
[OTH],"Uh, this is Martin..."
[OTH],"Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know."
[OTH],How the hell'd you know that?
[OTH],"Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?"
[OTH],"Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-"
[OTH],"Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance."
[OTH],"Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus."
[OTH],"Next caller, you're on the air."
[OTH],Jesus?
[OTH],Yes my son?
[OTH],"Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?"
[OTH],My son...
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.
[OTH],Next caller.
[OTH],Goddammit!
[OTH],I heard that.
[OTH],What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Cartman,"Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!"
[OTH],"Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?"
[OTH],"Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole!"
Cartman,"Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer."
[OTH],"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Oh, biiitch."
Cartman,Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.
[OTH],And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans."
[OTH],"Oho yeah, I love beans."
Cartman,"Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming."
[OTH],"Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa, please?"
[OTH],"Okay, grandpa, okay. Just get out of the way of the TV."
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart."
[OTH],"Well, don't fart on me, Terrance."
Cartman,"Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again."
[OTH],(Oh my God!)
Cartman,"Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny."
[OTH],"You're such an asshole, Terrance."
[OTH],"Haha, that I am!"
[OTH],(Ow!)
Cartman,"Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart."
[OTH],Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
[OTH],"We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it."
[OTH],"No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?!"
[OTH],"Tug - a - little harder, Billy."
[OTH],Aaah!!
[OTH],"Uh, ow."
[OTH],You little jerk!
[OTH],You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom!
[OTH],Dammit! I was so close.
[OTH],"Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather."
[OTH],"Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?"
[OTH],"We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and..."
[OTH],"Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame."
[OTH],"These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!"
[OTH],Woooo!
[OTH],Huh? Oh god! Oh god!
[OTH],"We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!"
[OTH],"We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!"
[OTH],"We want more quality television, like Full House."
[OTH],"Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me."
[OTH],"Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh."
[OTH],I just had a brown baby boy.
[OTH],"Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around."
[OTH],"Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever."
[OTH],Whoopeee!
[OTH],"Come here Billy, I want to show you something."
[OTH],"Aww, do I have to?"
[OTH],"Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me..."
[OTH],"...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa."
[OTH],"Hey, what are you doing?!"
[OTH],What are they doing in there?
Cartman,I don't know.
[OTH],"Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready, Billy?"
[OTH],"Uh, I guess."
[OTH],"Okay, you, you can let me out now."
[OTH],Not just yet.
[OTH],"Let me out, grandpa!"
[OTH],"I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time."
[OTH],"That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa."
[OTH],"'Gonna fly, gonna fly, gonna fly'"
[OTH],"Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand."
[OTH],"So now will you kill me, Billy?"
[OTH],"Sure I will grandpa, I will."
[OTH],"Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working."
[OTH],"It'll work, it has to."
[OTH],Look! It's the president of the network.
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warsog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network."
[OTH],Fuck you.
[OTH],"Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there."
[OTH],"Hey, you will not get away with this!"
[OTH],"That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'."
[OTH],"Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?"
[OTH],"Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?"
[OTH],"Ohhh, yes, indeedy."
[OTH],"Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. You got the cow all tied up?"
[OTH],"Yep, all done."
[OTH],"'Kay, come on guys."
Cartman,Why don't we just shoot him?
[OTH],"You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted."
[OTH],"Yeah, stupid!"
[OTH],"That's good Billy, a little higher now."
[OTH],Moooo!
[OTH],"The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?"
[OTH],"Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!"
[OTH],"We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes."
[OTH],"Are you ready, grandpa?"
[OTH],Does the pope crap in the woods?
[OTH],"7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52."
[OTH],Mooo!
[OTH],Carry on.
[OTH],"Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you."
[OTH],"Uhh, cut the damn rope already!"
[OTH],What is that?!
[OTH],"Well, it, it looks like..."
[OTH],Death!
[OTH],Mrrrrr!
[OTH],It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.
[OTH],"Come on, let's go."
[OTH],What the...?
[OTH],"Hey, he's coming towards us."
[OTH],Why is Death coming after us?
[OTH],Mrrr.
[OTH],Ahhh!
Cartman,"Aaaah, runrunruuun!"
[OTH],Mrrr.
[OTH],What are we gonna do?
[OTH],Mooorrrr!
[OTH],"As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors."
[OTH],"Here Carol, I think it's your boy."
[OTH],"Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?"
[OTH],"Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!"
[OTH],"Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there."
[OTH],"Yeah, but, mom!"
[OTH],"Here honey, talk to your father."
[OTH],Did you turn the heat down?
[OTH],"Dad, Death is coming!"
[OTH],"Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather."
[OTH],Mrrrr!
[OTH],"Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place."
[OTH],"Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids."
[OTH],"(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)"
[OTH],Totally dude.
[OTH],Good point man.
[OTH],Mrrrr!
[OTH],Ahhhh!
[OTH],"Quick, jump through the window."
Cartman,"Ehh, eh, ehhhh!"
[OTH],Mrrrr!
[OTH],Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
[OTH],"Come back here, you pompousy son of a pansy!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
[OTH],"Come over here, you son of a whore!"
[OTH],"Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?"
[OTH],"Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?"
[OTH],"Oh, you farted."
[OTH],Ohho God.
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?"
[OTH],"No Terrance, why don't you tell me?"
[OTH],"Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!"
[OTH],Hey look!
[OTH],"Oh, there's one."
[OTH],"Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is..."
[OTH],"Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!"
[OTH],"Wait, wait."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked."
[OTH],"Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Somers."
[OTH],"Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!"
[OTH],"Huh, oh no!"
[OTH],"At last, now we can return to normality."
[OTH],"Hey, Phillip."
[OTH],"Yes, Terrance?"
[OTH],Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
[OTH],"Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check."
Cartman,"Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on."
[OTH],We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.
[OTH],Mrrrrr!
[OTH],Ahhh!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!"
[OTH],"Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time."
[OTH],"Hey, you were supposed to kill me!"
[OTH],Mrrr.
[OTH],"That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Billllyyyy...
[OTH],Grandpa?
[OTH],"That's right, Billy."
[OTH],"My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?"
[OTH],"I asked you to kill me, Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo."
[OTH],Limbo?
[OTH],"I was wrong to put you in that position, Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes."
[OTH],But I've been waiting for 25 years.
[OTH],"Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes..."
[OTH],"Come on you guys, let's go home."
[OTH],Here they are!
[OTH],"Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air.
Cartman,"You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!"
[OTH],But look what they put on.
[OTH],And now back to She's the Sheriff.
Cartman,"Ohhh, God, No!"
[OTH],You are the one behind all these shenanigans.
[OTH],"Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it."
[OTH],What did he say?
[OTH],"Up yours, butt-munch."
[OTH],Whatwhatwhaaat!!!
[OTH],"Come on everybody, back to New York!"
[OTH],"Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?"
[OTH],"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes."
Cartman,My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
[OTH],"Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?"
[OTH],Cool!
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],What are you doing grandpa?
[OTH],I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?
[OTH],That's my silly grandpa.
[OTH],"Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear grandpa..."
[OTH],Uhhhhh.
[OTH],...Happy birthday to you.
[OTH],Now blow out the candles grandpa.
[OTH],Hurray!!!
[OTH],"How's it feel to be 102, paps?"
[OTH],Shoot me.
[OTH],Make a wish grandpa.
[OTH],I wish I were dead
[OTH],"Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa."
[OTH],"I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old."
[OTH],"Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?"
[OTH],I will.
[OTH],Me.
[OTH],"It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on."
[OTH],"That show's for babies, it's so stupid."
[OTH],"Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?"
[OTH],"Oh, alright, but take your grandpa with you."
[OTH],"Aw, dammit!"
[OTH],Language.
[OTH],And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
[OTH],"Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart."
[OTH],"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb."
[OTH],Heheheh hehehe...
[OTH],Uhhhhh
[OTH],"Ah, dammit!"
[OTH],How would you like to make a dollar Billy?
[OTH],"My name's not Billy, grandpa. It's Stan."
[OTH],"Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
[OTH],"I'm not gonna kill you, grandpa."
[OTH],Why not?
[OTH],'Cause I'll get in trouble.
[OTH],I killed my grandpa when I was your age.
[OTH],"Leave me alone, grandpa."
[OTH],What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents.
[OTH],"Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too."
[OTH],"Ohhh, you farted."
[OTH],"Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?"
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?"
[OTH],I sure would Terrance.
[OTH],"Alrighty then, here's a two-lip."
[OTH],What is this?
[OTH],It's horrible!
[OTH],"Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip."
[OTH],"Take that, you stupid dick."
[OTH],What did he say?
[OTH],"You're an asshole, Phillip."
[OTH],Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?
[OTH],"Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!"
[OTH],But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
[OTH],Oh really? Is that so?
[OTH],"Oh no, Phillip, looks like you're about to fart."
[OTH],"You're exactly right, Terrance. Oh."
[OTH],Oh no.
Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!"
[OTH],"Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth."
Cartman,That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
[OTH],"Ohhh, okay hon."
[OTH],"I'm not going to kill you, grandpa!"
[OTH],Ingrate!
[OTH],"Good night, grandpa."
[OTH],You pompous son of a whore!
[OTH],"Huh huh, I had another ..."
[OTH],Ow! What the hell was that for?!
Cartman,That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
[OTH],"Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?"
[OTH],Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
Cartman,"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!"
[OTH],Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
Cartman,"Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?"
[OTH],"She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip."
[OTH],"Yeahh, woohoo!"
[OTH],"Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Hat. Shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor'. They don't expand your minds."
[OTH],"You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash."
[OTH],"Kenny, why are you late to class?"
[OTH],"Oh, okay Kenny, be seated."
[OTH],"Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because..."
[OTH],"Yes Kenny, what is it?"
[OTH],(I have to go poop.)
[OTH],I thought you just came from the bathroom.
[OTH],"(I did, I gotta go again...)"
[OTH],"Okay okay, go ahead."
[OTH],"As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment."
[OTH],"Whoa! Smells like you slaughtered a cow in there, Kenny!"
[OTH],Pay attention children!
[OTH],"I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?
[OTH],"That's right, children. Are there any questions?"
[OTH],"Yes, Stanley?"
[OTH],Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
[OTH],"What, what do you mean?"
[OTH],"My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should."
[OTH],"Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna."
[OTH],Really??
[OTH],"Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all."
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,"Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!"
[OTH],"So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],"Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole."
[OTH],(OH MY GOD!)
[OTH],(Owww!)
Cartman,Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.
[OTH],"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late."
[OTH],But won't your grandpa be there?
[OTH],Yeah...
Cartman,"Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money."
[OTH],Hello there children.
[OTH],Hey Chef.
[OTH],How's it goin'?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?"
[OTH],"You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on."
[OTH],"No, I mean, kill my grandpa."
[OTH],"No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal."
[OTH],"See, I told you dude."
[OTH],"Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?"
Cartman,"Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?"
[OTH],I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
[OTH],What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this???
[OTH],And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean.
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, guess what?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Fart.
[OTH],"Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny."
[OTH],"Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh."
[OTH],Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
[OTH],"Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters."
[OTH],"Ha ha, green apple splatters."
[OTH],Uhhhh.
[OTH],"Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay."
[OTH],"Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet."
[OTH],"No grandpa, I'll get in trouble."
[OTH],"Kill me, God dammit!"
[OTH],"No, I can't even kill a deer."
[OTH],"Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?"
Cartman,I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
[OTH],"Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch."
Cartman,What!
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],Grandpa!
[OTH],"And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too."
Cartman,Hey!
[OTH],"Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma."
Cartman,You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
[OTH],"That's the spirit, Tubby."
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman, he's just trying to get to you."
Cartman,Don't talk about my mom like that!
[OTH],We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
[OTH],"I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?"
Cartman,"Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes."
Cartman,"Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang."
[OTH],"I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die."
[OTH],"I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance."
[OTH],"Hey, yeah!"
[OTH],"And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access."
[OTH],"Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace."
[OTH],"First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'."
[OTH],"Yeah, is this Jesus?"
[OTH],"Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback."
[OTH],"Oh, sorry."
[OTH],"Uh, this is Martin..."
[OTH],"Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know."
[OTH],How the hell'd you know that?
[OTH],"Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?"
[OTH],"Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-"
[OTH],"Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance."
[OTH],"Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus."
[OTH],"Next caller, you're on the air."
[OTH],Jesus?
[OTH],Yes my son?
[OTH],"Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?"
[OTH],My son...
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.
[OTH],Next caller.
[OTH],Goddammit!
[OTH],I heard that.
[OTH],What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Cartman,"Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!"
[OTH],"Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?"
[OTH],"Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole!"
Cartman,"Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer."
[OTH],"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Oh, biiitch."
Cartman,Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.
[OTH],And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans."
[OTH],"Oho yeah, I love beans."
Cartman,"Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming."
[OTH],"Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa, please?"
[OTH],"Okay, grandpa, okay. Just get out of the way of the TV."
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart."
[OTH],"Well, don't fart on me, Terrance."
Cartman,"Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again."
[OTH],(Oh my God!)
Cartman,"Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny."
[OTH],"You're such an asshole, Terrance."
[OTH],"Haha, that I am!"
[OTH],(Ow!)
Cartman,"Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart."
[OTH],Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
[OTH],"We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it."
[OTH],"No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?!"
[OTH],"Tug - a - little harder, Billy."
[OTH],Aaah!!
[OTH],"Uh, ow."
[OTH],You little jerk!
[OTH],You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom!
[OTH],Dammit! I was so close.
[OTH],"Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather."
[OTH],"Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?"
[OTH],"We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and..."
[OTH],"Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame."
[OTH],"These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!"
[OTH],Woooo!
[OTH],Huh? Oh god! Oh god!
[OTH],"We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!"
[OTH],"We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!"
[OTH],"We want more quality television, like Full House."
[OTH],"Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me."
[OTH],"Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh."
[OTH],I just had a brown baby boy.
[OTH],"Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around."
[OTH],"Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever."
[OTH],Whoopeee!
[OTH],"Come here Billy, I want to show you something."
[OTH],"Aww, do I have to?"
[OTH],"Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me..."
[OTH],"...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa."
[OTH],"Hey, what are you doing?!"
[OTH],What are they doing in there?
Cartman,I don't know.
[OTH],"Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready, Billy?"
[OTH],"Uh, I guess."
[OTH],"Okay, you, you can let me out now."
[OTH],Not just yet.
[OTH],"Let me out, grandpa!"
[OTH],"I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time."
[OTH],"That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa."
[OTH],"'Gonna fly, gonna fly, gonna fly'"
[OTH],"Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand."
[OTH],"So now will you kill me, Billy?"
[OTH],"Sure I will grandpa, I will."
[OTH],"Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working."
[OTH],"It'll work, it has to."
[OTH],Look! It's the president of the network.
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warsog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network."
[OTH],Fuck you.
[OTH],"Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there."
[OTH],"Hey, you will not get away with this!"
[OTH],"That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'."
[OTH],"Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?"
[OTH],"Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?"
[OTH],"Ohhh, yes, indeedy."
[OTH],"Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. You got the cow all tied up?"
[OTH],"Yep, all done."
[OTH],"'Kay, come on guys."
Cartman,Why don't we just shoot him?
[OTH],"You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted."
[OTH],"Yeah, stupid!"
[OTH],"That's good Billy, a little higher now."
[OTH],Moooo!
[OTH],"The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?"
[OTH],"Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!"
[OTH],"We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes."
[OTH],"Are you ready, grandpa?"
[OTH],Does the pope crap in the woods?
[OTH],"7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52."
[OTH],Mooo!
[OTH],Carry on.
[OTH],"Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you."
[OTH],"Uhh, cut the damn rope already!"
[OTH],What is that?!
[OTH],"Well, it, it looks like..."
[OTH],Death!
[OTH],Mrrrrr!
[OTH],It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.
[OTH],"Come on, let's go."
[OTH],What the...?
[OTH],"Hey, he's coming towards us."
[OTH],Why is Death coming after us?
[OTH],Mrrr.
[OTH],Ahhh!
Cartman,"Aaaah, runrunruuun!"
[OTH],Mrrr.
[OTH],What are we gonna do?
[OTH],Mooorrrr!
[OTH],"As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors."
[OTH],"Here Carol, I think it's your boy."
[OTH],"Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?"
[OTH],"Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!"
[OTH],"Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there."
[OTH],"Yeah, but, mom!"
[OTH],"Here honey, talk to your father."
[OTH],Did you turn the heat down?
[OTH],"Dad, Death is coming!"
[OTH],"Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather."
[OTH],Mrrrr!
[OTH],"Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place."
[OTH],"Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids."
[OTH],"(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)"
[OTH],Totally dude.
[OTH],Good point man.
[OTH],Mrrrr!
[OTH],Ahhhh!
[OTH],"Quick, jump through the window."
Cartman,"Ehh, eh, ehhhh!"
[OTH],Mrrrr!
[OTH],Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
[OTH],"Come back here, you pompousy son of a pansy!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
[OTH],"Come over here, you son of a whore!"
[OTH],"Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?"
[OTH],"Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?"
[OTH],"Oh, you farted."
[OTH],Ohho God.
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?"
[OTH],"No Terrance, why don't you tell me?"
[OTH],"Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!"
[OTH],Hey look!
[OTH],"Oh, there's one."
[OTH],"Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is..."
[OTH],"Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!"
[OTH],"Wait, wait."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked."
[OTH],"Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Somers."
[OTH],"Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!"
[OTH],"Huh, oh no!"
[OTH],"At last, now we can return to normality."
[OTH],"Hey, Phillip."
[OTH],"Yes, Terrance?"
[OTH],Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
[OTH],"Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check."
Cartman,"Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on."
[OTH],We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.
[OTH],Mrrrrr!
[OTH],Ahhh!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!"
[OTH],"Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time."
[OTH],"Hey, you were supposed to kill me!"
[OTH],Mrrr.
[OTH],"That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Billllyyyy...
[OTH],Grandpa?
[OTH],"That's right, Billy."
[OTH],"My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?"
[OTH],"I asked you to kill me, Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo."
[OTH],Limbo?
[OTH],"I was wrong to put you in that position, Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes."
[OTH],But I've been waiting for 25 years.
[OTH],"Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes..."
[OTH],"Come on you guys, let's go home."
[OTH],Here they are!
[OTH],"Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air.
Cartman,"You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!"
[OTH],But look what they put on.
[OTH],And now back to She's the Sheriff.
Cartman,"Ohhh, God, No!"
[OTH],You are the one behind all these shenanigans.
[OTH],"Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it."
[OTH],What did he say?
[OTH],"Up yours, butt-munch."
[OTH],Whatwhatwhaaat!!!
[OTH],"Come on everybody, back to New York!"
[OTH],"Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?"
[OTH],"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes."
Cartman,My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
[OTH],"Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?"
[OTH],Cool!
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],What are you doing grandpa?
[OTH],I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?
[OTH],That's my silly grandpa.
[OTH],Vladned chaviski. Bodad comrade Dobalsted.(Propulsion systems stable... No problems with Mir...)
[OTH],Graaah.
[OTH],Ayyy!
[OTH],"Porchad. Hehe, vlided il chalfeka(Gotcha, Happy Halloween)"
[OTH],"Shtaad, boded but shtaad.(You scared me, you communist bastard)"
[OTH],"Oh, shtool.(Oh...Crap)"
[OTH],Shtool.(Crap)
[OTH],Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
[OTH],You bastards!
Cartman,What the hell is that thing?
[OTH],It looks like a UFO.
Cartman,There's no such thing as UFOs.
[OTH],Let's get 'im to the morgue.
Cartman,"Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass."
[OTH],"Dude, it can't be cooler than mine."
[OTH],"Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready."
[OTH],"You know, I think death is least funny when it happens to a child."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah... I know what you mean."
[OTH],"Marty, do you have to put that stuff on everything?"
[OTH],"I don't know, it ju- it just makes everything taste so...English."
[OTH],"Well, let's let him drain."
[OTH],"...So then the necrophiliac says, ""If this ain't a cadaver then I-"""
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],God damn! That little turd bit me!
[OTH],Me too!
[OTH],"Ha ha, you look like a pansy."
[OTH],Shut up Kyle!
[OTH],"What uh, what are you supposed to be?"
[OTH],I'm Raggedy Andy.
[OTH],Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
[OTH],"Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure."
[OTH],No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
[OTH],Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
[OTH],Wow! Cool!
Cartman,"Hey, dudes."
[OTH],Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
Cartman,"It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil."
[OTH],Where'd you get that?
Cartman,"My mom made it, isn't it cool?"
[OTH],No it's not cool!
Cartman,"What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?"
[OTH],"No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass!"
Cartman,"Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool."
[OTH],Hehe. Sissy.
[OTH],"I'll kick your ass, Kyle!"
Cartman,"Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!"
[OTH],"Hey look, Kenny's not dead."
[OTH],You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.
[OTH],"Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?"
[OTH],"Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?"
Cartman,"Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage."
Cartman,"I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!"
Cartman,"I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!"
Cartman,Poor piece of crap.
[OTH],"COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING LATE!"
[OTH],"Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank."
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],"I said, ""I can't wait to own a fishing tank."""
[OTH],"Oh, neither can I."
[OTH],Very interesting.
[OTH],"What, what is it doc?"
[OTH],"Well, your- your temperature is only 55 degrees, you have no pulse, no heartbeat, and your, your eyes are all puffy and sticky."
[OTH],"Oh no, you mean..."
[OTH],"Yeah, I'm afraid the two of you have - Pink Eye."
[OTH],"I'd give you topical medicine, but I don't wanna touch ya."
[OTH],"Oh I'm so hungry, and all I can think about eating is, eh, brains!"
[OTH],"Yeah, well for God sake don't touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some antibiotics."
[OTH],Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous...
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
[OTH],It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.
[OTH],Roar.
[OTH],Dammit!
[OTH],Wendy?
[OTH],"Hi, Stan."
[OTH],"You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?"
[OTH],Yeahhh?
[OTH],We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
[OTH],"I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look."
[OTH],You what?!
[OTH],"I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca."
[OTH],Heheh. Heheh.
[OTH],"Hey Stan, you look almost pretty enough to kiss."
[OTH],"Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh."
[OTH],Yehaha.
[OTH],Huhuh.
Cartman,"There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?"
[OTH],"Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!"
Cartman,You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
[OTH],Wookies don't live on Endor!
Cartman,Wookies don't live on Endor.
[OTH],Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Cartman,What?! What did you say?
[OTH],"Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel-"
[OTH],Eww.
[OTH],Is there a problem Kenny?
[OTH],"Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?"
[OTH],I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
[OTH],"Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things..."
[OTH],Hello there!
[OTH],Uuuhh.
[OTH],Happy Halloween!
[OTH],Must eat brains.
[OTH],"It's the most wonderful time of the year,
do do do do do do do do-"
[OTH],Aaargh!!! Oh my God!!!
[OTH],I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
Cartman,"Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding? No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like. Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you."
[OTH],Aren't you hungry Kenny?
[OTH],"He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything."
[OTH],"Hello, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
Cartman,Eating Kenny's pudding.
[OTH],"Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef."
[OTH],Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
[OTH],"Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?"
[OTH],"Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!"
[OTH],Eric! God bless it! what do you think you're doing?!
Cartman,"Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself."
Cartman,"That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool."
[OTH],"Where did you get that costume, young man?!"
Cartman,"My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!"
[OTH],"Shhh! Oh, God bless America."
[OTH],You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
Cartman,"Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o."
[OTH],"Owww, you bit my arm!"
[OTH],"Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal."
[OTH],Watch the video Eric.
[OTH],"Adolf Hitler was a very, very naughty man!"
[OTH],Schnell ach. Lovental bros lieben. Alle Menschen werden Brüder. Doktor Stalin? Alarm! Menchoss? Zellan vei zamboa-
Cartman,"Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!"
[OTH],"So remember kids, dressing like Hitler in school isn't cool!"
[OTH],"Now, do you have any questions?"
Cartman,Could I see that again? That was cool.
[OTH],"You must remove that costume, immediately!"
Cartman,"I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy."
[OTH],"Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now."
[OTH],"Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?"
Cartman,I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
[OTH],"Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man."
[OTH],"Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around."
Cartman,Boo! I'm a ghost.
[OTH],"Oh man, I feel like a total choad."
Cartman,"Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad."
[OTH],"Hello, children."
Cartman,Hey Chef.
[OTH],Aaaaah!
Cartman,"Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?"
[OTH],"Hey, where's Kyle?"
[OTH],Check this out!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
Cartman,What is that?
[OTH],I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
[OTH],"Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes."
[OTH],"Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers."
Cartman,Who?
[OTH],"Dude, I thought she was dead."
[OTH],"Yeah, me too."
[OTH],"Thank you Miss Yothers. Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume."
[OTH],"...And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume!"
[OTH],"What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!"
[OTH],"And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children. Yeah."
[OTH],"Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!"
[OTH],Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
[OTH],I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
[OTH],"Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe."
[OTH],"That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing."
[OTH],Brainnns. Ahh.
[OTH],Wait your turn Clyde.
[OTH],Uuuuuuuuuuuuuhh!
[OTH],"Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?"
[OTH],Piiink eyyye.
[OTH],Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye!
[OTH],"...And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, ""Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussy space station."""
[OTH],"In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini."
[OTH],"Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus."
[OTH],"Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes."
[OTH],Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
Cartman,"Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him."
[OTH],I bet I get more candy than you dude.
Cartman,Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
[OTH],"No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference."
Cartman,"Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking."
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!"
Cartman,"God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!"
[OTH],Hey dudes.
[OTH],"Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight..."
Cartman,Check.
[OTH],Plastic pumpkin pails...
[OTH],Check.
[OTH],Taser...
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],"For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something."
Cartman,"Yeah, granola pisses me off."
[OTH],Hey Kenny.
Cartman,"Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny."
[OTH],You still didn't get a costume Kenny?
Cartman,"Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire."
Cartman,"I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!"
Cartman,"I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate."
[OTH],Hi guys.
Cartman,Hi Wendy.
[OTH],How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?
[OTH],"Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi."
Cartman,You what?! Are you insane?!
[OTH],Let's go trick-or-treats.
[OTH],"I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day."
[OTH],"Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad."
Cartman,How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
[OTH],"Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!"
[OTH],But Stan!
[OTH],"No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!"
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAH!
[OTH],Doctor!
[OTH],"Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?"
[OTH],"No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead."
[OTH],What the hell are you talking about?
[OTH],"Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!"
[OTH],"Chef, Ah- I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Le- let me give you some, some topical cream."
[OTH],"Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!"
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],"Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef."
[OTH],"Oh, sorry."
[OTH],"But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here."
[OTH],"Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years."
[OTH],"Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?"
[OTH],"Well, uh, i- it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeah."
[OTH],Aaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],"Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody."
[OTH],Ahh!
[OTH],Trick-or-treat!
[OTH],"Ohh, how cute."
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],"Dude, Kenny!"
[OTH],"Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911!"
Cartman,"Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy."
[OTH],Call 911!
[OTH],"Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops."
Cartman,"You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!"
[OTH],"Mayor, we've got a big problem."
[OTH],Ugh!
[OTH],"Why, why Chef. What a surprise!"
[OTH],You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
[OTH],"Actually, uh-"
[OTH],"Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia."
[OTH],Not a thingy-dingy.
[OTH],I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
[OTH],"You mean, Tina Yothers?"
[OTH],"No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!"
[OTH],"Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?"
[OTH],"Aw, the hell with you both!"
[OTH],"Well, let's get back to it."
[OTH],Righty-o.
[OTH],Trick-or-treat.
[OTH],Hope you kids like chocolate-peanut butter-cream puffies.
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah!
Cartman,Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
[OTH],"Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!"
[OTH],"Oh, God!"

[OTH],"Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them."
Cartman,Can we have some candy now please?!
[OTH],"Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!"
Cartman,I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
[OTH],"Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha!"
[OTH],What are you talking about Chef?
[OTH],Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
[OTH],"Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains."
[OTH],"Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town."
[OTH],"Oh my God, that means..."
[OTH],If everyone is turned into zombies...
Cartman,"Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!"
Cartman,Aaah!
[OTH],"Chef, you've gotta help us!"
[OTH],I'm working on it children.
[OTH],"Wait, where are we going?"
[OTH],"The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue."
Cartman,It was Kyle.
[OTH],I don't know about this Chef.
[OTH],"Yeah, I'm scared."
Cartman,"Remember candy, focus on the candy."
[OTH],What are we doing here Chef?
[OTH],Just look for anything suspicious.
[OTH],I found it! I found it!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"See Cartman, your mom is on the cover."
Cartman,"Eh, shit..."
[OTH],We told you dude.
Cartman,"You guys, shit..."
[OTH],You better let me take that Kyle.
[OTH],Hey Chef. Look
[OTH],I gotta call this hotline number children.

Cartman,It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Look out children!
[OTH],"Ow, ooh, ow, gowuh-"
[OTH],"Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?"
[OTH],Chef!!!
[OTH],"I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid."
[OTH],Let's get out of here!
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
[OTH],We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
Cartman,"Hey, there's a pay phone!"
[OTH],You call the number Kyle.
[OTH],But the zombies are coming!
[OTH],We'll hold 'em off.
[OTH],"Welcome to the Worcestershire Sauce customer service hotline. For Worcestershire sauce recipes please press 1 followed by the pound sign. For Worcestershire sauce product placement, please press 2. If Worcestershire sauce has been used as embalming, please pr..."
Cartman,Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!

[OTH],There's a bunch of zombies here!
[OTH],Please hold.
[OTH],Wendy?
[OTH],Aaahahah!
Cartman,"Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!"
[OTH],"I know, but uh-... but..."
Cartman,Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
[OTH],"Hey, yeah!"
[OTH],"For regular sauce, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you do not just go out and start decapitating zombies left and right. Do you understand? Do not start decapitating zombies left and right!"
[OTH],"Uh, okay. Then what?"
[OTH],Aaahh.
[OTH],"Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it."
Cartman,Kill her Stan!
[OTH],"All you have to do is kill the original zombie. The one that started the whole mess. Once you kill the original zombie, all the others zombies will turn back to normal."
[OTH],"Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!"
[OTH],"We realize you have a choice in worcestershire sauces, we are delighted that..."
[OTH],"Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary."
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],"I, I can't."
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
[OTH],"Oh, what happened? Stan?"
[OTH],Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
[OTH],It's working! They're turning back to normal.
[OTH],You did it children!
Cartman,"Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!"
[OTH],I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
[OTH],"That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead."
[OTH],Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.
[OTH],"Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!"
[OTH],"Oh man, I can't believe he's gone."
[OTH],"Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us."
[OTH],"Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw."
Cartman,"Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way."
[OTH],"You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving."
[OTH],"...No, dude, that's Christmas."
[OTH],"Oh, then, what's Halloween about?"
[OTH],Costumes and candy.
[OTH],Oh.
Cartman,"Well, let's go home, start eating that candy."
[OTH],"We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money."
[OTH],"Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month."
Cartman,"Lehh, eh, screw you guys!"

[OTH],Let's get 'im to the morgue.
Cartman,"Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass."
[OTH],"Dude, it can't be cooler than mine."
[OTH],"Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready."
[OTH],"You know, I think death is least funny when it happens to a child."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah... I know what you mean."
[OTH],"Marty, do you have to put that stuff on everything?"
[OTH],"I don't know, it ju- it just makes everything taste so...English."

[OTH],I'm Raggedy Andy.
[OTH],Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
[OTH],"Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure."
[OTH],No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
[OTH],Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
[OTH],Wow! Cool!
Cartman,"Hey, dudes."
[OTH],Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
Cartman,"It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil."
[OTH],Where'd you get that?
Cartman,"My mom made it, isn't it cool?"
[OTH],No it's not cool!
Cartman,"What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?"
[OTH],"No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass!"
Cartman,"Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool."
[OTH],Hehe. Sissy.
[OTH],"I'll kick your ass, Kyle!"
Cartman,"Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!"
[OTH],"Hey look, Kenny's not dead."
[OTH],You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.
[OTH],"Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?"
[OTH],"Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?"
Cartman,"Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage."
Cartman,"I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!"
Cartman,"I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!"
Cartman,Poor piece of crap.
[OTH],"COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING LATE!"
[OTH],"Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank."
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],"I said, ""I can't wait to own a fishing tank."""
[OTH],"Oh, neither can I."
[OTH],Very interesting.
[OTH],"What, what is it doc?"
[OTH],"Well, your- your temperature is only 55 degrees, you have no pulse, no heartbeat, and your, your eyes are all puffy and sticky."
[OTH],"Oh no, you mean..."
[OTH],"Yeah, I'm afraid the two of you have - Pink Eye."
[OTH],"I'd give you topical medicine, but I don't wanna touch ya."
[OTH],"Oh I'm so hungry, and all I can think about eating is, eh, brains!"
[OTH],"Yeah, well for God sake don't touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some antibiotics."
[OTH],Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous...
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
[OTH],It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.
[OTH],Roar.
[OTH],Dammit!
[OTH],Wendy?
[OTH],"Hi, Stan."
[OTH],"You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?"
[OTH],Yeahhh?
[OTH],We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
[OTH],"I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look."
[OTH],You what?!
[OTH],"I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca."
[OTH],Heheh. Heheh.
[OTH],"Hey Stan, you look almost pretty enough to kiss."
[OTH],"Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh."
[OTH],Yehaha.
[OTH],Huhuh.
Cartman,"There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?"
[OTH],"Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!"
Cartman,You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
[OTH],Wookies don't live on Endor!
Cartman,Wookies don't live on Endor.

[OTH],Aren't you hungry Kenny?
[OTH],"He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything."
[OTH],"Hello, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."

[OTH],"Now, do you have any questions?"
Cartman,Could I see that again? That was cool.
[OTH],"You must remove that costume, immediately!"
Cartman,"I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy."
[OTH],"Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now."
[OTH],"Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?"
Cartman,I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
[OTH],"Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man."
[OTH],"Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around."

[OTH],"In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini."
[OTH],"Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus."
[OTH],"Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes."
[OTH],Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
Cartman,"Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him."
[OTH],I bet I get more candy than you dude.
Cartman,Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
[OTH],"No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference."
Cartman,"Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking."
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!"
Cartman,"God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!"
[OTH],Hey dudes.
[OTH],"Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight..."
Cartman,Check.
[OTH],Plastic pumpkin pails...
[OTH],Check.
[OTH],Taser...
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],"For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something."
Cartman,"Yeah, granola pisses me off."
[OTH],Hey Kenny.
Cartman,"Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny."
[OTH],You still didn't get a costume Kenny?
Cartman,"Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire."
Cartman,"I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!"
Cartman,"I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate."
[OTH],Hi guys.
Cartman,Hi Wendy.
[OTH],How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?
[OTH],"Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi."
Cartman,You what?! Are you insane?!
[OTH],Let's go trick-or-treats.
[OTH],"I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day."
[OTH],"Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad."
Cartman,How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
[OTH],"Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!"
[OTH],But Stan!
[OTH],"No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!"
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAH!
[OTH],Doctor!
[OTH],"Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?"
[OTH],"No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead."
[OTH],What the hell are you talking about?
[OTH],"Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!"
[OTH],"Chef, Ah- I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Le- let me give you some, some topical cream."
[OTH],"Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!"
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],"Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef."
[OTH],"Oh, sorry."
[OTH],"But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here."
[OTH],"Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years."
[OTH],"Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?"
[OTH],"Well, uh, i- it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeah."
[OTH],Aaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],"Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody."
[OTH],Ahh!
[OTH],Trick-or-treat!
[OTH],"Ohh, how cute."
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],"Dude, Kenny!"
[OTH],"Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911!"
Cartman,"Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy."
[OTH],Call 911!
[OTH],"Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops."
Cartman,"You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!"
[OTH],"Mayor, we've got a big problem."
[OTH],Ugh!
[OTH],"Why, why Chef. What a surprise!"
[OTH],You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
[OTH],"Actually, uh-"
[OTH],"Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia."
[OTH],Not a thingy-dingy.
[OTH],I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
[OTH],"You mean, Tina Yothers?"
[OTH],"No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!"
[OTH],"Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?"
[OTH],"Aw, the hell with you both!"
[OTH],"Well, let's get back to it."
[OTH],Righty-o.
[OTH],Trick-or-treat.
[OTH],Hope you kids like chocolate-peanut butter-cream puffies.
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah!
Cartman,Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
[OTH],"Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!"
[OTH],"Oh, God!"
[OTH],Trick-or-treat.
Cartman,Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.
Cartman,One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],Trick-or-t-Aaah!
[OTH],Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
[OTH],"Hey, Chef, trick-"
[OTH],Chef! No!
[OTH],"Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them."
Cartman,Can we have some candy now please?!
[OTH],"Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!"
Cartman,I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
[OTH],"Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha!"
[OTH],What are you talking about Chef?
[OTH],Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
[OTH],"Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains."
[OTH],"Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town."
[OTH],"Oh my God, that means..."
[OTH],If everyone is turned into zombies...
Cartman,"Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!"
Cartman,Aaah!
[OTH],"Chef, you've gotta help us!"
[OTH],I'm working on it children.
[OTH],"Wait, where are we going?"
[OTH],"The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue."
Cartman,It was Kyle.
[OTH],I don't know about this Chef.
[OTH],"Yeah, I'm scared."
Cartman,"Remember candy, focus on the candy."
[OTH],What are we doing here Chef?
[OTH],Just look for anything suspicious.
[OTH],I found it! I found it!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"See Cartman, your mom is on the cover."
Cartman,"Eh, shit..."
[OTH],We told you dude.
Cartman,"You guys, shit..."
[OTH],You better let me take that Kyle.
[OTH],Hey Chef. Look
[OTH],I gotta call this hotline number children.
[OTH],Piiink eye!
Cartman,It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Look out children!
[OTH],"Ow, ooh, ow, gowuh-"
[OTH],"Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?"
[OTH],Chef!!!
[OTH],"I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid."
[OTH],Let's get out of here!
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
[OTH],We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
Cartman,"Hey, there's a pay phone!"
[OTH],You call the number Kyle.
[OTH],But the zombies are coming!
[OTH],We'll hold 'em off.
[OTH],"Welcome to the Worcestershire Sauce customer service hotline. For Worcestershire sauce recipes please press 1 followed by the pound sign. For Worcestershire sauce product placement, please press 2. If Worcestershire sauce has been used as embalming, please pr..."
Cartman,Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!
Cartman,"Aaah, kew!"
[OTH],Sweet!
[OTH],"Worcestershire sauce emergency hotline, this call might be monitored to ensure you the highest quality service, how may I help you?"
[OTH],There's a bunch of zombies here!
[OTH],Please hold.
[OTH],Wendy?
[OTH],Aaahahah!
Cartman,"Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!"
[OTH],"I know, but uh-... but..."
Cartman,Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
[OTH],"Hey, yeah!"
[OTH],"For regular sauce, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you do not just go out and start decapitating zombies left and right. Do you understand? Do not start decapitating zombies left and right!"
[OTH],"Uh, okay. Then what?"
[OTH],Aaahh.
[OTH],"Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it."
Cartman,Kill her Stan!
[OTH],"All you have to do is kill the original zombie. The one that started the whole mess. Once you kill the original zombie, all the others zombies will turn back to normal."
[OTH],"Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!"
[OTH],"We realize you have a choice in worcestershire sauces, we are delighted that..."
[OTH],"Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary."
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],"I, I can't."
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
[OTH],"Oh, what happened? Stan?"
[OTH],Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
[OTH],It's working! They're turning back to normal.
[OTH],You did it children!
Cartman,"Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!"
[OTH],I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
[OTH],"That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead."
[OTH],Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.
[OTH],"Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!"
[OTH],"Oh man, I can't believe he's gone."
[OTH],"Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us."
[OTH],"Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw."
Cartman,"Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way."
[OTH],"You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving."
[OTH],"...No, dude, that's Christmas."
[OTH],"Oh, then, what's Halloween about?"
[OTH],Costumes and candy.
[OTH],Oh.
Cartman,"Well, let's go home, start eating that candy."
[OTH],"We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money."
[OTH],"Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month."
Cartman,"Lehh, eh, screw you guys!"
[OTH],"(Heeeeyyyy, kick ass.)"
[OTH],(Ow!)
[OTH],That was awesome!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?
Cartman,Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
[OTH],Sure hon.
Cartman,"And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!"
[OTH],Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
[OTH],It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here.
[OTH],AAAAAH!
[OTH],Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
Cartman,Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
[OTH],"Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs."
[OTH],"Oh, cool."
[OTH],And now a word from our sponsor.
[OTH],"Here in the heart of Africa children are dying. Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I'm Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help."
[OTH],"Hey, who's that fat chick?"
[OTH],"Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce."
[OTH],Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
[OTH],"Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman."
Cartman,"Yeah, HEY!"
[OTH],For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.
Cartman,"That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?"
[OTH],Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.
Cartman,KICK ASS!!
[OTH],SWEET!
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
[OTH],Did they say if it's waterproof?
[OTH],Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],What did she say?
[OTH],"Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear."
[OTH],Ass-rammer.
[OTH],Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Cartman,When do we get the sports watch?
[OTH],Just a second fat-ass!
Cartman,You vas-deferens!
[OTH],"Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?"
[OTH],"(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Ask her if we get the watch right away.
[OTH],Do we get the sports watch right away?
[OTH],She says we do.
[OTH],Cool.
Cartman,"I get to wear it first, you guys."
[OTH],I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Cartman,"Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said."
[OTH],"Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?"
[OTH],"Yes, Eric?"
Cartman,When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
[OTH],"Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people."
[OTH],A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
[OTH],"You mean, like Kenny?"
[OTH],Exactly.
Cartman,Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
[OTH],"I don't know Eric, they just do."
[OTH],"Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people."
Cartman,"I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!"
[OTH],Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
Cartman,"Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!"
[OTH],This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
Cartman,"Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!"
[OTH],Many would rather die than go to those places!
Cartman,"Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!"
[OTH],"Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],What the hell is going on?!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],"Well, you don't see that everyday."
[OTH],"Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor."
[OTH],It should be something festive.
[OTH],"Mayor, we've got a very big problem."
[OTH],"Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?"
[OTH],"Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving."
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],"You know, to provide food for the needy."
[OTH],Of course.
[OTH],"Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off."
[OTH],Naturally.
[OTH],"Oh, do go on."
[OTH],"We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short."
[OTH],You were saying?
[OTH],"They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil."
[OTH],"Oh, my!"
[OTH],Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.
[OTH],Uh now why would you say that?
[OTH],Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?
Cartman,"I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?"
[OTH],Not yet hon.
[OTH],Damn.
[OTH],"Hey, look you guys."
[OTH],"And now, back to Part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special."
[OTH],"I sure am cold, Phillip."
[OTH],"Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass."
[OTH],"Gosh, I hope we don't starve."
[OTH],"Ah, a squeaker!"
[OTH],The digital sports watch is here.
Cartman,What the hell?
[OTH],"Dude, that's not a digital sports watch."
[OTH],"Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians."
[OTH],"Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch."
[OTH],Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.
[OTH],Whoa! That was cool.
[OTH],"Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?"
[OTH],What's your name dude?
[OTH],Mabin.
[OTH],I think he said his name is Marvin.
Cartman,"Yeah, Starvin' Marvin."
[OTH],Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
Cartman,Hey mooom?
[OTH],Yes hon?
Cartman,"We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?"
[OTH],"Sure, hon."
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow."
[OTH],"Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother."
Cartman,No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
[OTH],It was my mom's credit card.
[OTH],"Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me."
Cartman,"Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor."
[OTH],Totally.
Cartman,Ahh!
[OTH],Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
[OTH],Not as beautiful as you.
[OTH],Ooooh.
[OTH],"Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys."
[OTH],"Oohh, they're so beautiful."
[OTH],Not as beautiful as you.
[OTH],"Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer."
[OTH],Not as beautiful as-
[OTH],This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Cartman,"Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income."
Cartman,Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?
Cartman,"You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers."
[OTH],Ap-ee-tizer.
Cartman,"This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry."
Cartman,"Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers."
Cartman,"No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie."
[OTH],"Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share."
Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right."
Cartman,"Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man? Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here..."
[OTH],"Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive."
[OTH],And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?
[OTH],Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.
[OTH],"Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell."
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah, we do!"
Cartman,"Yeah, that's right."
[OTH],We do!
[OTH],"All right boys, show us what you've brought."
[OTH],"This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin."
[OTH],He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.
Cartman,"No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn."
Cartman,"No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!"
[OTH],"Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?"
[OTH],He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
[OTH],The sports watch from the commercial?
[OTH],"Yeah, that one."
[OTH],I want a Starvin' Marvin.
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
[OTH],"Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me."
[OTH],"Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned."
[OTH],"Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude."
[OTH],"Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now."
[OTH],"Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson."
[OTH],No.
[OTH],You can't care for this child!
[OTH],But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
[OTH],"Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park."
[OTH],So why can't he live here now?
[OTH],Because he can't!
[OTH],Because why?
[OTH],Because eight-year olds can't be parents!
[OTH],Then you take care of him.
[OTH],"I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy."
[OTH],"I send my five dollars a month, see?"
[OTH],"This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend."
Cartman,"Oh well, back to the poor country with you."
[OTH],You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
Cartman,"B-huh, huh. Yeah, right."
[OTH],I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.
[OTH],"Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees."
[OTH],Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.
[OTH],"Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts."
[OTH],"Oh, whoops."
[OTH],Now tell me what you see.
[OTH],"Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA."
[OTH],"Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing."
[OTH],What does it mean?
[OTH],"Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world."
[OTH],"Oh, fudge!"
[OTH],"Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again."
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch."
Cartman,"Hey, hey, what's going on?!"
Cartman,"Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!"
[OTH],"Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up."
Cartman,"Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!"
[OTH],Sweet.
[OTH],So how does this thing work?
[OTH],"Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family."
[OTH],POVVVV?
[OTH],Poverty stricken citizen.
[OTH],"Ohhoho, brilliant."
[OTH],Daah!! What the hell is this!!
[OTH],"I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program."
[OTH],They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.
[OTH],"It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!"
[OTH],"Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!"
[OTH],Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
[OTH],"OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!"
[OTH],We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?"
[OTH],"Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon."
[OTH],"Huh, eh,"
[OTH],wait wait wait.
[OTH],"Eh, eh."
[OTH],"Here it comes, ehhhh."
[OTH],"Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!"
[OTH],Aaaah.
[OTH],I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.
[OTH],I spattered his face!
[OTH],Now he's a smelly Indian.
[OTH],"We'll be back to part 14 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, right after this."
[OTH],Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.
Cartman,"Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!"
[OTH],"So please, call and adopt a child today."
Cartman,I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
[OTH],You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?
[OTH],"Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Sweet.
Cartman,"Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere."
Cartman,"Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?"
Cartman,"Well, screw you too!"
Cartman,What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!
[OTH],"All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa."
[OTH],"Hey, where's Cartman?"
[OTH],"I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?"
[OTH],Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.
[OTH],"Come on, hurry up."
[OTH],Grab a lot son.
[OTH],Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!
[OTH],"Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!"
[OTH],"Come on, Kenny!"
[OTH],"Come on, son!"
[OTH],"Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family."
[OTH],It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- string beans. Hehe.
[OTH],What the-?!
[OTH],"Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!"
[OTH],"Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos."
[OTH],"I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen."
[OTH],"Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your..."
[OTH],What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
[OTH],That's not important right now.
[OTH],No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
[OTH],"Chef, the turkeys!"
[OTH],"Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!"
[OTH],We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
Cartman,"Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat."
Cartman,"Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!"
Cartman,I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
[OTH],"Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up."
Cartman,But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
[OTH],"Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch."
Cartman,WEEEEEEAK!!!
[OTH],"People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys."
[OTH],There's too many of them.
[OTH],Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!
[OTH],We can't stop them.
[OTH],"Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!"
[OTH],"Wooo, yeahhh, woo."
[OTH],"Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!"
[OTH],Here you go turkeys!
[OTH],Does my hair look okay?
Cartman,Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...
Cartman,"I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh."
Cartman,"Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err."
Cartman,"Huh, I wonder what's in here?"
Cartman,SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!
Cartman,Sally Struthers?!
[OTH],Who the hell are you?!
Cartman,Gimme that cake!
[OTH],"Nooho, this is my cake!"
Cartman,"No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!"
[OTH],NOO! You can't have any!
Cartman,"No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!"
Cartman,"You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!"
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],Stay close children.
[OTH],Yeaaa!
[OTH],(O-Oh.)
[OTH],"Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned."
[OTH],We did it!!
[OTH],"My God, what have we done?"
[OTH],We've saved Thanksgiving!
[OTH],"But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead."
[OTH],"Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives."
[OTH],"As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-"
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
[OTH],"Excuse me sir, we're looking for a little starving Ethiopian boy who was accidentally delivered to South Park instead of a Teiko sports watch."
[OTH],Have you seen anyone fitting this description.
[OTH],"Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister."
[OTH],There you are. Are you ready to go home now?
[OTH],"Wow, it sucks he has to leave."
[OTH],"Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman."
[OTH],"You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people."
[OTH],"But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
[OTH],We're terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately.
Cartman,"That's right you will, God-Damnit."
Cartman,"Move it POVs, I'm an American!"
[OTH],"A baba, gluck gluck bababab ga."
[OTH],Baba gook gook ba.
[OTH],(What are you doing? Let me off of here!)
[OTH],"Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us, and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen."
[OTH],Amen.
[OTH],Does anybody have a can opener?
[OTH],God Damn-it.
[OTH],That was awesome!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?
Cartman,Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
[OTH],Sure hon.
Cartman,"And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!"
[OTH],Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
[OTH],It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here.
[OTH],AAAAAH!
[OTH],Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
Cartman,Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
[OTH],"Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs."
[OTH],"Oh, cool."
[OTH],And now a word from our sponsor.
[OTH],"Here in the heart of Africa children are dying. Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I'm Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help."
[OTH],"Hey, who's that fat chick?"
[OTH],"Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce."
[OTH],Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
[OTH],"Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman."
Cartman,"Yeah, HEY!"
[OTH],For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.
Cartman,"That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?"
[OTH],Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.
Cartman,KICK ASS!!
[OTH],SWEET!
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
[OTH],Did they say if it's waterproof?
[OTH],Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],What did she say?
[OTH],"Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear."
[OTH],Ass-rammer.
[OTH],Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Cartman,When do we get the sports watch?
[OTH],Just a second fat-ass!
Cartman,You vas-deferens!
[OTH],"Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?"
[OTH],"(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Ask her if we get the watch right away.
[OTH],Do we get the sports watch right away?
[OTH],She says we do.
[OTH],Cool.
Cartman,"I get to wear it first, you guys."
[OTH],I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Cartman,"Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said."
[OTH],"Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?"
[OTH],"Yes, Eric?"
Cartman,When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
[OTH],"Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people."
[OTH],A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
[OTH],"You mean, like Kenny?"
[OTH],Exactly.
Cartman,Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
[OTH],"I don't know Eric, they just do."
[OTH],"Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people."
Cartman,"I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!"
[OTH],Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
Cartman,"Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!"
[OTH],This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
Cartman,"Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!"
[OTH],Many would rather die than go to those places!
Cartman,"Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!"
[OTH],"Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],What the hell is going on?!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],"Well, you don't see that everyday."
[OTH],"Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor."
[OTH],It should be something festive.
[OTH],"Mayor, we've got a very big problem."
[OTH],"Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?"
[OTH],"Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving."
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],"You know, to provide food for the needy."
[OTH],Of course.
[OTH],"Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off."
[OTH],Naturally.
[OTH],"Oh, do go on."
[OTH],"We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short."
[OTH],You were saying?
[OTH],"They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil."
[OTH],"Oh, my!"
[OTH],Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.
[OTH],Uh now why would you say that?
[OTH],Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?
Cartman,"I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?"
[OTH],Not yet hon.
[OTH],Damn.
[OTH],"Hey, look you guys."
[OTH],"And now, back to Part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special."
[OTH],"I sure am cold, Phillip."
[OTH],"Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass."
[OTH],"Gosh, I hope we don't starve."
[OTH],"Ah, a squeaker!"
[OTH],The digital sports watch is here.
Cartman,What the hell?
[OTH],"Dude, that's not a digital sports watch."
[OTH],"Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians."
[OTH],"Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch."
[OTH],Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.
[OTH],Whoa! That was cool.
[OTH],"Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?"
[OTH],What's your name dude?
[OTH],Mabin.
[OTH],I think he said his name is Marvin.
Cartman,"Yeah, Starvin' Marvin."
[OTH],Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
Cartman,Hey mooom?
[OTH],Yes hon?
Cartman,"We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?"
[OTH],"Sure, hon."
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow."
[OTH],"Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother."
Cartman,No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
[OTH],It was my mom's credit card.
[OTH],"Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me."
Cartman,"Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor."
[OTH],Totally.
Cartman,Ahh!
[OTH],Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
[OTH],Not as beautiful as you.
[OTH],Ooooh.
[OTH],"Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys."
[OTH],"Oohh, they're so beautiful."
[OTH],Not as beautiful as you.
[OTH],"Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer."
[OTH],Not as beautiful as-
[OTH],This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Cartman,"Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income."
Cartman,Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?
Cartman,"You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers."
[OTH],Ap-ee-tizer.
Cartman,"This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry."
Cartman,"Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers."
Cartman,"No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie."
[OTH],"Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share."
Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right."
Cartman,"Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man? Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here..."
[OTH],"Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive."
[OTH],And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?
[OTH],Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.
[OTH],"Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell."
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah, we do!"
Cartman,"Yeah, that's right."
[OTH],We do!
[OTH],"All right boys, show us what you've brought."
[OTH],"This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin."
[OTH],He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.
Cartman,"No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn."
Cartman,"No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!"
[OTH],"Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?"
[OTH],He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
[OTH],The sports watch from the commercial?
[OTH],"Yeah, that one."
[OTH],I want a Starvin' Marvin.
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
[OTH],"Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me."
[OTH],"Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned."
[OTH],"Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude."
[OTH],"Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now."
[OTH],"Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson."
[OTH],No.
[OTH],You can't care for this child!
[OTH],But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
[OTH],"Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park."
[OTH],So why can't he live here now?
[OTH],Because he can't!
[OTH],Because why?
[OTH],Because eight-year olds can't be parents!
[OTH],Then you take care of him.
[OTH],"I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy."
[OTH],"I send my five dollars a month, see?"
[OTH],"This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend."
Cartman,"Oh well, back to the poor country with you."
[OTH],You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
Cartman,"B-huh, huh. Yeah, right."
[OTH],I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.
[OTH],"Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees."
[OTH],Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.
[OTH],"Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts."
[OTH],"Oh, whoops."
[OTH],Now tell me what you see.
[OTH],"Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA."
[OTH],"Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing."
[OTH],What does it mean?
[OTH],"Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world."
[OTH],"Oh, fudge!"
[OTH],"Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again."
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch."
Cartman,"Hey, hey, what's going on?!"
Cartman,"Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!"
[OTH],"Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up."
Cartman,"Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!"
[OTH],Sweet.
[OTH],So how does this thing work?
[OTH],"Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family."
[OTH],POVVVV?
[OTH],Poverty stricken citizen.
[OTH],"Ohhoho, brilliant."
[OTH],Daah!! What the hell is this!!
[OTH],"I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program."
[OTH],They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.
[OTH],"It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!"
[OTH],"Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!"
[OTH],Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
[OTH],"OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!"
[OTH],We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!
[OTH],"Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?"
[OTH],"Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon."
[OTH],"Huh, eh,"
[OTH],wait wait wait.
[OTH],"Eh, eh."
[OTH],"Here it comes, ehhhh."
[OTH],"Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!"
[OTH],Aaaah.
[OTH],I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.
[OTH],I spattered his face!
[OTH],Now he's a smelly Indian.
[OTH],"We'll be back to part 14 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, right after this."
[OTH],Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.
Cartman,"Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!"
[OTH],"So please, call and adopt a child today."
Cartman,I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
[OTH],You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?
[OTH],"Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Sweet.
Cartman,"Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere."
Cartman,"Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?"
Cartman,"Well, screw you too!"
Cartman,What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!
[OTH],"All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa."
[OTH],"Hey, where's Cartman?"
[OTH],"I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?"
[OTH],Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.
[OTH],"Come on, hurry up."
[OTH],Grab a lot son.
[OTH],Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!
[OTH],"Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!"
[OTH],"Come on, Kenny!"
[OTH],"Come on, son!"
[OTH],"Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family."
[OTH],It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- string beans. Hehe.
[OTH],What the-?!
[OTH],"Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!"
[OTH],"Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos."
[OTH],"I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen."
[OTH],"Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your..."
[OTH],What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
[OTH],That's not important right now.
[OTH],No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
[OTH],"Chef, the turkeys!"
[OTH],"Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!"
[OTH],We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
Cartman,"Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat."
Cartman,"Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!"
Cartman,I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
[OTH],"Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up."
Cartman,But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
[OTH],"Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch."
Cartman,WEEEEEEAK!!!

[OTH],"Wooo, yeahhh, woo."
[OTH],"Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!"
[OTH],Here you go turkeys!
[OTH],Does my hair look okay?
Cartman,Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...
Cartman,"I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh."
Cartman,"Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err."
Cartman,"Huh, I wonder what's in here?"
Cartman,SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!
Cartman,Sally Struthers?!
[OTH],Who the hell are you?!
Cartman,Gimme that cake!
[OTH],"Nooho, this is my cake!"
Cartman,"No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!"

[OTH],God Damn-it.
[OTH],"We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year!"
[OTH],"Lights, please."
[OTH],"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,
keeping watch over their flocks by night.
And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them,
and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them,
'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy,
for born unto you this day in the city of
...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace,
goodwill towards men'

And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus."
[OTH],Unh Oh!
[OTH],"Come on, Mary! Push!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],I can see its head!
[OTH],UUuuhh-UUuuhh.
[OTH],It's a boy!
Cartman,Oohhhh!
[OTH],(Kyle has Jesus' head instead!)
[OTH],"Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you?"
[OTH],...Sorry.
[OTH],"And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!"
[OTH],"Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head."
[OTH],How dare you include the Nativity in a school play? Don't you realize my son is Jewish?!
[OTH],...So?
[OTH],So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
[OTH],Because it's Christmas???
[OTH],Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
[OTH],"Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you?"
[OTH],"Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!"
Cartman,Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
[OTH],"Shut up, fat boy!"
Cartman,"I'm not fat, I'm festively plump."
[OTH],"Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?"
[OTH],"How about the dreidel song, bubbe?"
[OTH],I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
[OTH],The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-"
[OTH],Christmas Poo?
Cartman,What the hell is Christmas Poo?
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?"
[OTH],"Kyle, that is enough!"
[OTH],"See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan."
[OTH],"Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison."
[OTH],Oh wait wait wait. I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark?
[OTH],"You guys, look! It's snowing!"
[OTH],"Whoa, Christmas snow!"
[OTH],Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue.
[OTH],It's fun.
[OTH],P'tooui.
[OTH],"That was sick, dude!"
Cartman,Hey!
Cartman,What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
[OTH],"We can, too!"
[OTH],"...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude."
[OTH],Officer Barbrady!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
[OTH],Yyess.
[OTH],Damnit!
[OTH],Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Cartman,"Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents."
[OTH],No. But I get Hanukkah presents for eight days.
Cartman,Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
[OTH],"We'll catch up with you later, Kyle."
[OTH],"Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo."
[OTH],"Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?"
[OTH],Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Cartman,"Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now."
[OTH],"Well! You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!"
Cartman,"You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle."
[OTH],"See you around, dude."
[OTH],"It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas..."
[OTH],"Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas."
[OTH],"Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down."
[OTH],"Mayor, we are deeply offended by the Nativity scene in front of the capital office. Church and State are separate!"
[OTH],No! Wrong!
[OTH],"What's going on, you guys?"
[OTH],The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet.
[OTH],"That isn't all, Mayor! The school play is doing a Nativity scene! It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!"
[OTH],You are the Jewish community!
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah!
Cartman,"Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!"
[OTH],"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Mayor, the Nativity is what Christmas is all about. If you remove Christ, you must remove Santa and Frosty and all of that garbage, too!"
[OTH],Hallelujah!
[OTH],Amen!
[OTH],And we must put a stop to the cutting down of Christmas trees!
[OTH],Raah!
[OTH],Give me a break!
[OTH],"And I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids. If you don't want to spill your coffee, you shouldn't be driving with it."
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah!
[OTH],"Okay, people, we clearly need to reach a compromise. Perhaps we need a new icon for Christmas."
[OTH],"Oooo, brilliant idea, Mayor!"
[OTH],"Hey! How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?"
[OTH],Ex-cuse me?
[OTH],Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
[OTH],Kyle! Sshhh!
[OTH],"It's true. He doesn't care what faith you are. 
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-"
Cartman,Don't mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy.
[OTH],(Kyle's lost it!)
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww."
[OTH],Wait...
[OTH],"Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions?"
[OTH],"Yes, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],Can we get rid of all the Mexicans?
[OTH],"No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans."
[OTH],Rats!
[OTH],"It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!"
[OTH],"Your father's right, Kyle."
[OTH],"Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!"
[OTH],"Listen to your father, Kyle."
[OTH],"Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'."
[OTH],"But dad, he always sh..."
[OTH],Say it!
[OTH],There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],Again!
[OTH],There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],"This is for your own good, bubbe."
[OTH],"Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!"
[OTH],Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.
[OTH],What did you say?!
[OTH],I said Ike's on fire!
[OTH],Oh oh. On flame? Oh oh. On flame?
[OTH],OH MY GOD!
[OTH],It isn't fair! I don't want to be an outcast!
[OTH],Kyle.
[OTH],I'm not hearing that.
[OTH],Kyle.
[OTH],Mr. Hankey?
[OTH],Howwwwdy-hoooo.
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell."
[OTH],"Go away, Mr. Hankey."
[OTH],"You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers."
[OTH],I said go away! My father said you aren't real.
[OTH],"Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song?"
[OTH],"Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'."
[OTH],Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
[OTH],"Folks'll gather round the fire
sing a song, stroll the choir
Pretty song they'll all retire
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'."
[OTH],"Kyle, what are you doing in there?"
[OTH],Nothing.
[OTH],Open this door!
[OTH],"I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we..."
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, come here."
[OTH],KYLE!
[OTH],"Say something, Mr. Hankey!"
[OTH],"Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!"
[OTH],Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?!
[OTH],Howdy-ho!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go?
[OTH],"You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold."
[OTH],"Nobody believes in you, not even my friends."
[OTH],"Aw, gee, that's too bad."
[OTH],"Hey! How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends."
[OTH],"Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas."
[OTH],Yeah! We'll show them!
[OTH],"Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group!"
[OTH],Is mistletoe offensive?
[OTH],Is anyone offended by mistletoe?
[OTH],Lose the mistletoe!
[OTH],You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
Cartman,How do you know?
[OTH],'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
Cartman,"Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000."
[OTH],What's that?
Cartman,"I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet."
[OTH],"Hello, everybodyyy."
[OTH],"What's in the box, dude?"
[OTH],It's a surprise.
Cartman,Let me see!
[OTH],O-Okay. But don't scare him...
[OTH],"Dude, sick!!!"
Cartman,Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
[OTH],(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
[OTH],Wait! You guys! He's alive!
[OTH],"Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep."
[OTH],"Come on, dance! Daaance! Dance, damn you!!"
[OTH],Now this is very simple. I'm going to say words and the computer will measure how offended you are by them. In this way we can find out which words are least offensive for use in the holiday season. Are we ready?
[OTH],Here we go: Christ
[OTH],Hm. Okay. Cherub.
[OTH],Hm... Camel
[OTH],Hm. Sad.
[OTH],Stupid Wop Dago.
[OTH],Bench...
[OTH],"Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?"
[OTH],Mayor's orders.
[OTH],"Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus."
Cartman,Thanks to Kyle's mother.
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
[OTH],So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.
[OTH],"Yes, Eric?"
Cartman,"How about we sing ""Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch"", in D minor."
[OTH],"I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
Cartman,"O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch,
she's a big fat bitch,
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch,
if there ever was a bitch,
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
[OTH],Howdy-ho!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey.
Cartman,"Monday she's a bitch,
on Tuesday she's a bitch,
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different,
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!"
[OTH],"Golly, that isn't very nice."
[OTH],I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.
Cartman,"Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom? 
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BIIIIII-I-I-ITCH - aahh."
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, no!"
[OTH],Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!!
[OTH],What the...
Cartman,"Gross, Kyle!"
[OTH],"Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric?"
[OTH],Uuuuuuhh...
Cartman,YOU SICK BASTARD!
[OTH],"Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?"
[OTH],I don't have a problem.
[OTH],"Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],"Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle."
[OTH],Mookie-stinks?
[OTH],"Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Wull, not on purpose."
[OTH],"So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya?"
[OTH],"Well, sometimes..."
[OTH],And that must make you mad.
[OTH],Well sure.
[OTH],"Mad enough to kill, Kyle???"
[OTH],"No, dude!"
[OTH],"Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?"
[OTH],But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
[OTH],Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have.
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],Howdy-ho.
[OTH],"Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?"
[OTH],"Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way..."
[OTH],"To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac..."
[OTH],"Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy..."
[OTH],Hhmm.
[OTH],"...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?"
[OTH],"Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous."
[OTH],Okay. Now let's practice our...
[OTH],No! Get away from me!
[OTH],Here. Just look more closely at it.
[OTH],"No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay?"
[OTH],"Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please."
[OTH],Reason?
[OTH],I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
[OTH],Any allergies?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],Jacket!
Cartman,"Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on?"
[OTH],"Good, it looks like they have taken the Christmas trees down."
[OTH],"Yes, and there's nothing Christian, either. This should be great!"
[OTH],"Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it."
[OTH],"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma..."
[OTH],Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday...
[OTH],"Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage. That's very offensive to non-Christians."
[OTH],"Oh, come on!"
[OTH],"Hey! Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!"
[OTH],I agree.
[OTH],Oh brother.
[OTH],"Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?"
[OTH],"And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there."
[OTH],(Hunh?)
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday Experience. Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef."
[OTH],"I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights."
[OTH],"You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
You can break my heart, and that means..."
[OTH],I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him.
[OTH],"...We should make love,"
Cartman,"Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it."
[OTH],...'Cause if we don't-
[OTH],"Okay, kids, get ready to take your places."
[OTH],"Thank you, Chef!"
[OTH],(Phew!)
[OTH],"And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass!"
[OTH],"As I turn and look into the sun, the rays burn my eyes."
[OTH],How like a turtle the sun looks.
[OTH],What the hell is this???
[OTH],This is horrible!!!
[OTH],This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!!
[OTH],You're the ones who made it this way!
[OTH],"Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian."
[OTH],It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus!
[OTH],All you bastards ruined Christmas!
[OTH],Get him in the ribs!
[OTH],Oof.
[OTH],Damn tree-hugger!
[OTH],"This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Say, where's Kyle?"
[OTH],We committed him.
[OTH],What? Why?
Cartman,'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
[OTH],Chirstmas poo? You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],Huh?! O-oh.
[OTH],"This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!"
[OTH],Well! You can believe in him now.
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH.
[OTH],I believe.
[OTH],I believe in Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!
[OTH],"Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery."
Cartman,Whoa!!
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, Chef!"
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!"
Cartman,"Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!"
Cartman,Talking poo is where I draw the line!
[OTH],What's all the ruckus?
[OTH],"I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey. The whole town is about to kill each other."
[OTH],I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!
[OTH],STOP FIGHTING!!
[OTH],"Oh my God, what the hell is that thing?"
[OTH],"Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, ""Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies""."
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew..."
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!"
[OTH],"Oh no, I'm not sane yet!"
[OTH],I brought some friends with me.
[OTH],Friends?
[OTH],"Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!"
[OTH],You mean you can see him? Ah-I'm not crazy?
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo..."
[OTH],"...he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you..."
[OTH],...Even if you're a Jew
[OTH],"Sometimes he's nutty, sometimes he's corny,
he can be brown or greenish-brown
But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve,
he might come to your town"
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
He loves me. I love you
Heeeeeeee Looooooves Yoooooouu!"
[OTH],"Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas."
Cartman,Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!
[OTH],Howdy-ho ho ho!
[OTH],"You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too."
[OTH],"Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right."
Cartman,"Yeah, something feels...unfinished."
[OTH],Wh-what could it be?
[OTH],(Yee he hee!)
[OTH],"Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me..."
[OTH],"We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year!"
[OTH],"Lights, please."
[OTH],"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,
keeping watch over their flocks by night.
And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them,
and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them,
'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy,
for born unto you this day in the city of
...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace,
goodwill towards men'

And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus."
[OTH],Unh Oh!
[OTH],"Come on, Mary! Push!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],I can see its head!
[OTH],UUuuhh-UUuuhh.
[OTH],It's a boy!
Cartman,Oohhhh!
[OTH],(Kyle has Jesus' head instead!)
[OTH],"Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you?"
[OTH],...Sorry.
[OTH],"And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!"
[OTH],"Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head."
[OTH],How dare you include the Nativity in a school play? Don't you realize my son is Jewish?!
[OTH],...So?
[OTH],So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
[OTH],Because it's Christmas???
[OTH],Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
[OTH],"Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you?"
[OTH],"Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!"
Cartman,Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
[OTH],"Shut up, fat boy!"
Cartman,"I'm not fat, I'm festively plump."
[OTH],"Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?"
[OTH],"How about the dreidel song, bubbe?"
[OTH],I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
[OTH],The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-"
[OTH],Christmas Poo?
Cartman,What the hell is Christmas Poo?
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?"
[OTH],"Kyle, that is enough!"
[OTH],"See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan."
[OTH],"Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison."
[OTH],Oh wait wait wait. I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark?
[OTH],"You guys, look! It's snowing!"
[OTH],"Whoa, Christmas snow!"
[OTH],Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue.
[OTH],It's fun.
[OTH],P'tooui.
[OTH],"That was sick, dude!"
Cartman,Hey!
Cartman,What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
[OTH],"We can, too!"
[OTH],"...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude."
[OTH],Officer Barbrady!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
[OTH],Yyess.
[OTH],Damnit!
[OTH],Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Cartman,"Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents."

[OTH],"Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo."

Cartman,"Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now."
[OTH],"Well! You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!"
Cartman,"You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle."
[OTH],"See you around, dude."
[OTH],"It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas

[OTH],"I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we..."
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, come here."
[OTH],KYLE!
[OTH],"Say something, Mr. Hankey!"
[OTH],"Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!"
[OTH],Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?!
[OTH],Howdy-ho!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go?
[OTH],"You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold."
[OTH],"Nobody believes in you, not even my friends."
[OTH],"Aw, gee, that's too bad."
[OTH],"Hey! How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends."
[OTH],"Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas."
[OTH],Yeah! We'll show them!
[OTH],"Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group!"
[OTH],Is mistletoe offensive?
[OTH],Is anyone offended by mistletoe?
[OTH],Lose the mistletoe!
[OTH],You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
Cartman,How do you know?
[OTH],'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
Cartman,"Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000."
[OTH],What's that?
Cartman,"I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet."
[OTH],"Hello, everybodyyy."
[OTH],"What's in the box, dude?"
[OTH],It's a surprise.
Cartman,Let me see!
[OTH],O-Okay. But don't scare him...
[OTH],"Dude, sick!!!"
Cartman,Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
[OTH],(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
[OTH],Wait! You guys! He's alive!
[OTH],"Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep."
[OTH],"Come on, dance! Daaance! Dance, damn you!!"
[OTH],Now this is very simple. I'm going to say words and the computer will measure how offended you are by them. In this way we can find out which words are least offensive for use in the holiday season. Are we ready?
[OTH],Here we go: Christ
[OTH],Hm. Okay. Cherub.
[OTH],Hm... Camel
[OTH],Hm. Sad.
[OTH],Stupid Wop Dago.
[OTH],Bench...
[OTH],"Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?"
[OTH],Mayor's orders.
[OTH],"Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus."
Cartman,Thanks to Kyle's mother.
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
[OTH],So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.
[OTH],"Yes, Eric?"
Cartman,"How about we sing ""Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch"", in D minor."
[OTH],"I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
Cartman,"O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch,
she's a big fat bitch,
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch,
if there ever was a bitch,
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
[OTH],Howdy-ho!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey.
Cartman,"Monday she's a bitch,
on Tuesday she's a bitch,
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different,
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!"
[OTH],"Golly, that isn't very nice."
[OTH],I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.
Cartman,"Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom? 
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BIIIIII-I-I-ITCH - aahh."
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, no!"
[OTH],Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!!
[OTH],What the...
Cartman,"Gross, Kyle!"
[OTH],"Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric?"
[OTH],Uuuuuuhh...
Cartman,YOU SICK BASTARD!
[OTH],"Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?"
[OTH],I don't have a problem.
[OTH],"Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],"Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle."
[OTH],Mookie-stinks?
[OTH],"Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Wull, not on purpose."
[OTH],"So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya?"
[OTH],"Well, sometimes..."
[OTH],And that must make you mad.
[OTH],Well sure.
[OTH],"Mad enough to kill, Kyle???"
[OTH],"No, dude!"
[OTH],"Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?"
[OTH],But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
[OTH],Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have.
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],Howdy-ho.
[OTH],"Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?"
[OTH],"Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way..."
[OTH],"To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac..."
[OTH],"Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy..."
[OTH],Hhmm.
[OTH],"...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?"
[OTH],"Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous."
[OTH],Okay. Now let's practice our...
[OTH],No! Get away from me!
[OTH],Here. Just look more closely at it.
[OTH],"No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay?"
[OTH],"Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please."
[OTH],Reason?
[OTH],I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
[OTH],Any allergies?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],Jacket!
Cartman,"Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on?"
[OTH],"Good, it looks like they have taken the Christmas trees down."
[OTH],"Yes, and there's nothing Christian, either. This should be great!"
[OTH],"Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it."
[OTH],"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma..."
[OTH],Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday...
[OTH],"Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage. That's very offensive to non-Christians."
[OTH],"Oh, come on!"
[OTH],"Hey! Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!"
[OTH],I agree.
[OTH],Oh brother.
[OTH],"Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?"
[OTH],"And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there."
[OTH],(Hunh?)
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday Experience. Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef."
[OTH],"I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights."
[OTH],"You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
You can break my heart, and that means..."
[OTH],I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him.
[OTH],"...We should make love,"
Cartman,"Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it."
[OTH],...'Cause if we don't-
[OTH],"Okay, kids, get ready to take your places."
[OTH],"Thank you, Chef!"
[OTH],(Phew!)
[OTH],"And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass!"
[OTH],"As I turn and look into the sun, the rays burn my eyes."
[OTH],How like a turtle the sun looks.
[OTH],What the hell is this???
[OTH],This is horrible!!!
[OTH],This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!!
[OTH],You're the ones who made it this way!
[OTH],"Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian."
[OTH],It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus!
[OTH],All you bastards ruined Christmas!
[OTH],Get him in the ribs!
[OTH],Oof.
[OTH],Damn tree-hugger!
[OTH],"This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Say, where's Kyle?"
[OTH],We committed him.
[OTH],What? Why?
Cartman,'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
[OTH],Chirstmas poo? You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],Huh?! O-oh.
[OTH],"This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!"
[OTH],Well! You can believe in him now.
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH.
[OTH],I believe.
[OTH],I believe in Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!
[OTH],"Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery."
Cartman,Whoa!!
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, Chef!"
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!"
Cartman,"Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!"
Cartman,Talking poo is where I draw the line!
[OTH],What's all the ruckus?
[OTH],"I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey. The whole town is about to kill each other."
[OTH],I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!
[OTH],STOP FIGHTING!!
[OTH],"Oh my God, what the hell is that thing?"
[OTH],"Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, ""Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies""."
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew..."
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!"
[OTH],"Oh no, I'm not sane yet!"
[OTH],I brought some friends with me.
[OTH],Friends?
[OTH],"Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!"
[OTH],You mean you can see him? Ah-I'm not crazy?
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo..."
[OTH],"...he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you..."
[OTH],...Even if you're a Jew
[OTH],"Sometimes he's nutty, sometimes he's corny,
he can be brown or greenish-brown
But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve,
he might come to your town"
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
He loves me. I love you
Heeeeeeee Looooooves Yoooooouu!"
[OTH],"Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas."
Cartman,Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!
[OTH],Howdy-ho ho ho!
[OTH],"You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too."
[OTH],"Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right."
Cartman,"Yeah, something feels...unfinished."
[OTH],Wh-what could it be?
[OTH],(Yee he hee!)
[OTH],"Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me..."
Cartman,"Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan..."
[OTH],"What is this, Cartman?"
Cartman,They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
[OTH],"Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?"
Cartman,"Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday..."
[OTH],"Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever."
Cartman,That's right.
[OTH],"Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too."
Cartman,That's ri-aayy.
[OTH],"Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation."
Cartman,"Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!"
Cartman,I shoved it up my ass!
Cartman,"Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!"
Cartman,"Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde..."
[OTH],"Children, children! Today is a very special day."
Cartman,"No, my birthday isn't until Saturday."
[OTH],"I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today."
Cartman,Eeeeeeh!
[OTH],"Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate... uh-uh, what's your name again?"
[OTH],Damien!
[OTH],Rectus...dominus...
[OTH],"Say 'hi' to Damien! And where are you from, Damien?"
[OTH],The seventh layer of hell!
[OTH],"Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama."
[OTH],"My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father!"
[OTH],... rectus... cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Your father?
[OTH],The Prince of Darkness!
[OTH],"Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era."
[OTH],"Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass..."
Cartman,"Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?"
[OTH],Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
Cartman,"Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?"
[OTH],Rectus... dominus...
Cartman,Byah. Oof!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Sancti...
[OTH],"Damn, what a freak!"
Cartman,Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!
[OTH],Cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.
[OTH],"Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes?"
Cartman,"Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble."
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?"
[OTH],Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
Cartman,Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
[OTH],Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
[OTH],"Yeah, that's weak!"
Cartman,"Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?"
[OTH],Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.
Cartman,"Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then."
[OTH],"Oh great, Green Mega Man it is."
Cartman,"Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is."
[OTH],"Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?"
Cartman,"Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!"
[OTH],Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
[OTH],"You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!"
Cartman,"Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two."
Cartman,Eeyy!
[OTH],"Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me."
[OTH],Then I will call you Pip.
[OTH],Right-o.
[OTH],Hey new kid!
[OTH],"Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog."
[OTH],"(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)"
[OTH],That does it! Woo-paah.
[OTH],... rectus... dominus...
[OTH],What the... ?
[OTH],Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
[OTH],A what?
[OTH],Quack-quack.
Cartman,"Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!"
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How's it going?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak."
[OTH],"Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song, 
We're all special in our own way
everybody's different, but that's okay,
'cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin,
different points of view, be tall or thin,
it doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin,"
[OTH],"With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been,"
[OTH],"Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh..."
[OTH],What were we talking about again?
[OTH],The new kid.
[OTH],Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all!
[OTH],Rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker!
[OTH],"We told you, dude."
[OTH],"We've got to do something, children!"
[OTH],Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus!
[OTH],... rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs... rectus... dominus...
[OTH],Jesus?
[OTH],"Two minutes to air, Jesus."
[OTH],"Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou."
[OTH],"Jesus, Jesus!"
[OTH],"Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show."
[OTH],"No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil."
[OTH],"Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny."
[OTH],Quack-quack.
[OTH],Wow. That's pretty heavy.
[OTH],"This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you."
[OTH],The Dark Prince?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One."
[OTH],Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
[OTH],"Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth."
[OTH],... K.
[OTH],"Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!"
Cartman,"Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money..."
[OTH],Rectus... dominus... sancti...
[OTH],Aaaaa Bebe!
[OTH],Our slide!
[OTH],Feel my wrath!
[OTH],"Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday."
[OTH],I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan!
[OTH],Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.
[OTH],... Rectus... cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Damien!
[OTH],Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!
[OTH],"So it is thou, Son of Lucifer!"
[OTH],"Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes."
[OTH],Let him come then. I shall stop him!
[OTH],Behold! He is already upon us! [Clouds begin to conceal the sun.
[OTH],"Ohh, dude!"
[OTH],Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
[OTH],What the hell's going on here?
[OTH],Look! It's that guy from the public access show!
[OTH],What's happening?
[OTH],"Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!"
[OTH],"Not you, dammit!"
[OTH],Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
[OTH],"Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!"
[OTH],Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!
[OTH],"Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!"
[OTH],You're gonna fight Satan?
[OTH],"This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history."
[OTH],Who will win our souls?
[OTH],Our Savior and Lord?
[OTH],Or the Prince of Darkness?
[OTH],It's the final battle between Good and Evil.
[OTH],"And it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95."
Cartman,"Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!"
[OTH],Quack-quack.
[OTH],"I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?"
Cartman,Cartman's birthday!
[OTH],We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
Cartman,"You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel."
[OTH],"Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in."
Cartman,"Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!"
[OTH],When is Satan gonna show up?
[OTH],Did the Devil show up yet?
[OTH],Not yet.
[OTH],"Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?"
[OTH],... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
Cartman,"Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince."
[OTH],"Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation."
[OTH],"You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus."
[OTH],Rectus... dominus...
[OTH],Behold. The Evil One approaches.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Holy poop on a stick!
[OTH],Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain!
[OTH],"Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge."
[OTH],Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
[OTH],"Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits!"
[OTH],Oh - oh yeah??
[OTH],Damn.
[OTH],I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee.
[OTH],Oh yeah??
[OTH],"Satan weighs in at - 320 lbs, 4 oz."
[OTH],"Jesus Christ weighs in at - 135 lbs., 1 oz."
[OTH],Ooh crap.
[OTH],"Aw, come on! I weigh more than that."
[OTH],"Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world."
[OTH],Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
[OTH],"Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too."
[OTH],Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck.
[OTH],Change my bet!
[OTH],I'm betting on the Devil!
[OTH],I wanna change my bet to Satan.
[OTH],"Me, too."
[OTH],Wai-wa I was here first.
[OTH],"Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, m'kay?"
[OTH],Everybody hates me!
[OTH],Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
[OTH],Because I'm the son of the Devil?
[OTH],"Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?"
[OTH],Because I... burn them and kill them?
[OTH],"Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. And no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. You be passive, m'kay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now."
[OTH],I bet I can spit the most on him.
[OTH],Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.
[OTH],Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
[OTH],"Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'."
Cartman,"Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!"
[OTH],I apologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice.
Cartman,"Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice!"
[OTH],"Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart."
[OTH],Yeah. We're gonna call you Fart-boy from now on.
[OTH],"Bubye, Fart-boy."
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],"Good day, Damien. How are you?"
[OTH],"Those guys farted on me, and then called me-"
[OTH],Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
[OTH],"Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-"
[OTH],Oh ooh.
[OTH],I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.
[OTH],"In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!"
[OTH],"You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!"
[OTH],Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
[OTH],"Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus."
[OTH],I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
[OTH],"Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!"
[OTH],"Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later.
[OTH],"What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?"
[OTH],"Yeah, crazy."
[OTH],He's so gay.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],You're all a bunch of Judases!
[OTH],"Hey, Jesus."
[OTH],"What are you doing out so late, kids?"
[OTH],We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
[OTH],"Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right?"
[OTH],"Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God."
[OTH],"Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?"
[OTH],"No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?"
[OTH],"Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?"
[OTH],I will crush him like a little bug!
[OTH],"Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War?"
[OTH],"Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring."
Cartman,"You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?"
[OTH],"Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs."
[OTH],"No way, dude!"
[OTH],Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
[OTH],"But you're his sparring partner, Chef."
[OTH],"Yeah, you have to hit him."
[OTH],"Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train."
[OTH],Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
[OTH],Give it your best sho- Oh!
[OTH],Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
[OTH],Anybody get the number of that truck?
[OTH],"Come on, kiddies. Eat more."
Cartman,"Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef."
[OTH],"Yup! Here's your present, children."
[OTH],"Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later."
[OTH],"Hey, you just got here, Chef!"
[OTH],"I know, but the fight is starting."
[OTH],"Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili."
[OTH],Mmmmm.
[OTH],Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
[OTH],I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
[OTH],"Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there."
[OTH],The other kids have always hated you?
[OTH],"Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me."
[OTH],"In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!"
[OTH],"And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!"
[OTH],"Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles."
Cartman,Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
[OTH],"Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid."
[OTH],"And neither were you, Pip!"
[OTH],"Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-"
[OTH],Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party.
[OTH],Rectus... dominus...
[OTH],... Sancti... cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Aaaa!
[OTH],Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee!
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Whoa, that was cool!"
[OTH],"Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien."
Cartman,Yeah. Come on in and join the party.
[OTH],"Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!"
Cartman,"Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?!"
[OTH],"It's a game, dude. It's really fun."
Cartman,You son of a bitch!
[OTH],Aaaaa!
Cartman,"You were supposed to get me the red Mega Man, eh! Now I can't make the Ultra Mega Mega Man, you dirty cheap-ass piece of crap!"
[OTH],They were all out of 'em dude!
Cartman,I hate you! I want you to die! Die!!
Cartman,Aah! Aaaaaggghhhhh!!
[OTH],Aaaaaaaa!
Cartman,That's it! Party is over!
Cartman,Everybody go home!
Cartman,"Get the hell out, I said! The party's over! Get out goddammt!!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!"
Cartman,Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!
[OTH],Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.
[OTH],"Aaanh, he does this all the time."
[OTH],"Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!"
[OTH],"Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty."
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],"Fight, dammit!"
[OTH],Oow! Ooooooh!
[OTH],"Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! You've got to fight, Jesus."
[OTH],"Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook."
[OTH],"Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you."
[OTH],It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
[OTH],"Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!"
[OTH],Uuuuh. Stan?
[OTH],Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
[OTH],Stan.
[OTH],She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
[OTH],Stan!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second."
[OTH],... Really?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude!"
[OTH],"Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks."
[OTH],"You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'."
[OTH],... Who said that?
[OTH],"You did, Jesus."
[OTH],"You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys!"
[OTH],Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
[OTH],"Nah, I saw it on Star Trek."
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],"Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!"
[OTH],"Okay, pal. You asked for it!"
[OTH],"Ooooooh, you got me."
[OTH],One... Two... Three...
[OTH],No way! He barely touched him!
[OTH],... Seven... Eight.
[OTH],... Nine... Ten. You're out!
[OTH],Our Savior!
[OTH],"The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!"
[OTH],"Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?
[OTH],"Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA!"
[OTH],I don't believe this!
[OTH],"Yeah, what a mean thing to do!"
[OTH],"Farewell, fools!"
[OTH],"Man, that guy is a jerk."
[OTH],Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
[OTH],"Boy, did we get screwed."
[OTH],"Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?"
[OTH],Aw heck. Do I have a choice?
[OTH],"Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!"
[OTH],Ih-it's comin' right for us!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],"Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you."
[OTH],You're leaving already?
[OTH],I have to. My dad's always on the move.
[OTH],Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
[OTH],Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
[OTH],Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
[OTH],"More pie, hon?"
Cartman,Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
Cartman,"Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan..."
[OTH],"What is this, Cartman?"
Cartman,They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
[OTH],"Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?"
Cartman,"Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday..."
[OTH],"Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever."
Cartman,That's right.
[OTH],"Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too."
Cartman,That's ri-aayy.
[OTH],"Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation."
Cartman,"Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!"
Cartman,I shoved it up my ass!
Cartman,"Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!"
Cartman,"Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde..."
[OTH],"Children, children! Today is a very special day."
Cartman,"No, my birthday isn't until Saturday."
[OTH],"I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today."
Cartman,Eeeeeeh!
[OTH],"Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate... uh-uh, what's your name again?"
[OTH],Damien!
[OTH],Rectus...dominus...
[OTH],"Say 'hi' to Damien! And where are you from, Damien?"
[OTH],The seventh layer of hell!
[OTH],"Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama."
[OTH],"My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father!"
[OTH],... rectus... cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Your father?
[OTH],The Prince of Darkness!
[OTH],"Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era."
[OTH],"Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass..."
Cartman,"Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?"
[OTH],Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
Cartman,"Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?"
[OTH],Rectus... dominus...
Cartman,Byah. Oof!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Sancti...
[OTH],"Damn, what a freak!"
Cartman,Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!
[OTH],Cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.
[OTH],"Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes?"
Cartman,"Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble."
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?"
[OTH],Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
Cartman,Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
[OTH],Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
[OTH],"Yeah, that's weak!"
Cartman,"Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?"
[OTH],Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.
Cartman,"Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then."
[OTH],"Oh great, Green Mega Man it is."
Cartman,"Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is."
[OTH],"Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?"
Cartman,"Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!"
[OTH],Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
[OTH],"You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!"
Cartman,"Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two."
Cartman,Eeyy!
[OTH],"Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me."
[OTH],Then I will call you Pip.
[OTH],Right-o.
[OTH],Hey new kid!
[OTH],"Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog."
[OTH],"(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)"
[OTH],That does it! Woo-paah.
[OTH],... rectus... dominus...
[OTH],What the... ?
[OTH],Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
[OTH],A what?
[OTH],Quack-quack.
Cartman,"Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!"
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How's it going?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak."
[OTH],"Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song, 
We're all special in our own way
everybody's different, but that's okay,
'cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin,
different points of view, be tall or thin,
it doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin,"
[OTH],"With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been,"
[OTH],"Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh..."
[OTH],What were we talking about again?
[OTH],The new kid.
[OTH],Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all!
[OTH],Rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker!
[OTH],"We told you, dude."
[OTH],"We've got to do something, children!"
[OTH],Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus!
[OTH],... rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs... rectus... dominus...
[OTH],Jesus?
[OTH],"Two minutes to air, Jesus."
[OTH],"Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou."
[OTH],"Jesus, Jesus!"
[OTH],"Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show."
[OTH],"No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil."
[OTH],"Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny."
[OTH],Quack-quack.
[OTH],Wow. That's pretty heavy.
[OTH],"This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you."
[OTH],The Dark Prince?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One."
[OTH],Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
[OTH],"Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth."
[OTH],... K.
[OTH],"Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!"
Cartman,"Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money..."
[OTH],Rectus... dominus... sancti...
[OTH],Aaaaa Bebe!
[OTH],Our slide!
[OTH],Feel my wrath!
[OTH],"Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday."
[OTH],I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan!
[OTH],Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.
[OTH],... Rectus... cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Damien!
[OTH],Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!
[OTH],"So it is thou, Son of Lucifer!"
[OTH],"Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes."
[OTH],Let him come then. I shall stop him!
[OTH],Behold! He is already upon us! [Clouds begin to conceal the sun.
[OTH],"Ohh, dude!"
[OTH],Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
[OTH],What the hell's going on here?
[OTH],Look! It's that guy from the public access show!
[OTH],What's happening?
[OTH],"Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!"
[OTH],"Not you, dammit!"
[OTH],Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
[OTH],"Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!"
[OTH],Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!
[OTH],"Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!"
[OTH],You're gonna fight Satan?
[OTH],"This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history."
[OTH],Who will win our souls?
[OTH],Our Savior and Lord?
[OTH],Or the Prince of Darkness?
[OTH],It's the final battle between Good and Evil.
[OTH],"And it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95."
Cartman,"Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!"
[OTH],Quack-quack.
[OTH],"I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?"
Cartman,Cartman's birthday!
[OTH],We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
Cartman,"You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel."
[OTH],"Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in."
Cartman,"Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!"
[OTH],When is Satan gonna show up?
[OTH],Did the Devil show up yet?
[OTH],Not yet.
[OTH],"Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?"
[OTH],... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
Cartman,"Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince."
[OTH],"Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation."
[OTH],"You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus."
[OTH],Rectus... dominus...
[OTH],Behold. The Evil One approaches.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Holy poop on a stick!
[OTH],Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain!
[OTH],"Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge."
[OTH],Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
[OTH],"Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits!"
[OTH],Oh - oh yeah??
[OTH],Damn.
[OTH],I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee.
[OTH],Oh yeah??
[OTH],"Satan weighs in at - 320 lbs, 4 oz."
[OTH],"Jesus Christ weighs in at - 135 lbs., 1 oz."
[OTH],Ooh crap.
[OTH],"Aw, come on! I weigh more than that."
[OTH],"Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world."
[OTH],Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
[OTH],"Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too."
[OTH],Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck.
[OTH],Change my bet!
[OTH],I'm betting on the Devil!
[OTH],I wanna change my bet to Satan.
[OTH],"Me, too."
[OTH],Wai-wa I was here first.
[OTH],"Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, m'kay?"
[OTH],Everybody hates me!
[OTH],Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
[OTH],Because I'm the son of the Devil?
[OTH],"Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?"
[OTH],Because I... burn them and kill them?
[OTH],"Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. And no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. You be passive, m'kay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now."
[OTH],I bet I can spit the most on him.
[OTH],Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.
[OTH],Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
[OTH],"Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'."
Cartman,"Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!"
[OTH],I apologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice.
Cartman,"Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice!"
[OTH],"Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart."
[OTH],Yeah. We're gonna call you Fart-boy from now on.
[OTH],"Bubye, Fart-boy."
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],"Good day, Damien. How are you?"
[OTH],"Those guys farted on me, and then called me-"
[OTH],Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
[OTH],"Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-"
[OTH],Oh ooh.
[OTH],I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.
[OTH],"In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!"
[OTH],"You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!"
[OTH],Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
[OTH],"Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus."
[OTH],I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
[OTH],"Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!"
[OTH],"Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later.
[OTH],"What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?"
[OTH],"Yeah, crazy."
[OTH],He's so gay.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],You're all a bunch of Judases!
[OTH],"Hey, Jesus."
[OTH],"What are you doing out so late, kids?"
[OTH],We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
[OTH],"Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right?"
[OTH],"Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God."
[OTH],"Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?"
[OTH],"No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?"
[OTH],"Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?"
[OTH],I will crush him like a little bug!
[OTH],"Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War?"
[OTH],"Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring."
Cartman,"You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?"
[OTH],"Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs."
[OTH],"No way, dude!"
[OTH],Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
[OTH],"But you're his sparring partner, Chef."
[OTH],"Yeah, you have to hit him."
[OTH],"Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train."
[OTH],Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
[OTH],Give it your best sho- Oh!
[OTH],Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
[OTH],Anybody get the number of that truck?
[OTH],"Come on, kiddies. Eat more."
Cartman,"Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef."
[OTH],"Yup! Here's your present, children."
[OTH],"Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later."
[OTH],"Hey, you just got here, Chef!"
[OTH],"I know, but the fight is starting."
[OTH],"Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili."
[OTH],Mmmmm.
[OTH],Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
[OTH],I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
[OTH],"Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there."
[OTH],The other kids have always hated you?
[OTH],"Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me."
[OTH],"In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!"
[OTH],"And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!"
[OTH],"Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles."
Cartman,Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
[OTH],"Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid."
[OTH],"And neither were you, Pip!"
[OTH],"Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-"
[OTH],Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party.
[OTH],Rectus... dominus...
[OTH],... Sancti... cheesy poofs...
[OTH],Aaaa!
[OTH],Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee!
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Whoa, that was cool!"
[OTH],"Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien."
Cartman,Yeah. Come on in and join the party.
[OTH],"Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!"
Cartman,"Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?!"
[OTH],"It's a game, dude. It's really fun."
Cartman,You son of a bitch!
[OTH],Aaaaa!
Cartman,"You were supposed to get me the red Mega Man, eh! Now I can't make the Ultra Mega Mega Man, you dirty cheap-ass piece of crap!"
[OTH],They were all out of 'em dude!
Cartman,I hate you! I want you to die! Die!!
Cartman,Aah! Aaaaaggghhhhh!!
[OTH],Aaaaaaaa!
Cartman,That's it! Party is over!
Cartman,Everybody go home!
Cartman,"Get the hell out, I said! The party's over! Get out goddammt!!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!"
Cartman,Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!
[OTH],Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.
[OTH],"Aaanh, he does this all the time."
[OTH],"Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!"
[OTH],"Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty."
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],"Fight, dammit!"
[OTH],Oow! Ooooooh!
[OTH],"Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! You've got to fight, Jesus."
[OTH],"Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook."
[OTH],"Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you."
[OTH],It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
[OTH],"Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!"
[OTH],Uuuuh. Stan?
[OTH],Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
[OTH],Stan.
[OTH],She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
[OTH],Stan!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second."
[OTH],... Really?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude!"
[OTH],"Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks."
[OTH],"You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'."
[OTH],... Who said that?
[OTH],"You did, Jesus."
[OTH],"You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys!"
[OTH],Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
[OTH],"Nah, I saw it on Star Trek."
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],"Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!"
[OTH],"Okay, pal. You asked for it!"
[OTH],"Ooooooh, you got me."
[OTH],One... Two... Three...
[OTH],No way! He barely touched him!
[OTH],... Seven... Eight.
[OTH],... Nine... Ten. You're out!
[OTH],Our Savior!
[OTH],"The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!"
[OTH],"Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?
[OTH],"Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA!"
[OTH],I don't believe this!
[OTH],"Yeah, what a mean thing to do!"
[OTH],"Farewell, fools!"
[OTH],"Man, that guy is a jerk."
[OTH],Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
[OTH],"Boy, did we get screwed."
[OTH],"Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?"
[OTH],Aw heck. Do I have a choice?
[OTH],"Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!"
[OTH],Ih-it's comin' right for us!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],"Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you."
[OTH],You're leaving already?
[OTH],I have to. My dad's always on the move.
[OTH],Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
[OTH],Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
[OTH],Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
[OTH],"More pie, hon?"
Cartman,Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
[OTH],"Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day."
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.
[OTH],"I can't afford a cruise, dude."
[OTH],"I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
Cartman,That is so-ho lame!
Cartman,"Oh man, I..."
[OTH],-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
Cartman,"Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time."
[OTH],"Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery."
[OTH],So you're going to have a substitute teacher.
[OTH],And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],"Yes, little boy?"
[OTH],We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],"...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen."
[OTH],"Hello, children."
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,"Wow, she's pretty."
[OTH],"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
[OTH],You can say that again.
[OTH],"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
[OTH],"Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay."
[OTH],Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.
[OTH],"Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,"
[OTH],...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us.
[OTH],Stan? Stan?!
[OTH],"Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?"
Cartman,"Yes, ma'am."
[OTH],Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.
[OTH],Yeu-bluuuch.
[OTH],"Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?"
Cartman,"Noh, he always pukes when he's in love."
[OTH],"I'll kick your ass, Cartman!"
[OTH],So you're alright?
[OTH],Bluuuch.
[OTH],"Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!"
[OTH],"Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes."
[OTH],"You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want."
[OTH],Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?
[OTH],"It sure is, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],"Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like this."
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],"Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this."
[OTH],"Oh, that's not bad."
[OTH],"Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this."
[OTH],WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
[OTH],Alright-y then.
[OTH],"Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food."
[OTH],I can live with that.
[OTH],"Alrighty then, let's get started!"
Cartman,"She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!"
[OTH],"Well that goes without saying, fat-ass, how could she help but look at you!"
[OTH],You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
Cartman,Until you puked on her.
[OTH],"Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?"
[OTH],"Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!"
[OTH],Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
[OTH],"Yeah, that one!"
[OTH],Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
[OTH],"Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],Well it is!
[OTH],That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
[OTH],"(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)"
[OTH],Thaat's right!
[OTH],"Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?"
[OTH],That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it...
[OTH],"Stan? We're still Valentines, right?"
[OTH],"Sure, Wendy, whatever."
[OTH],Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents
[OTH],Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!
Cartman,"I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners"
[OTH],"I remember when we were still in love
The moments that we shared were timeless.
Saw it in the wind, knew it in a glance,
the songs we sang were simple reminders."
[OTH],"Stark's Pond: she comes up behind him and says, ""Hi, Stan""
Stark's Pond: she asks him to come with her (to get Cartman)
Cafeteria: she hands him a note (an invitation to Stark's Pond)
Cemetery: amid a field of dead zombies, she puckers up
Classroom: she hands him a daisy (he throws up with every step she takes)"
[OTH],"I can't stop now My heart's awake
I feel your arms
My arms to take
I must have changed..."
[OTH],"A vivid sunset: she snuggles up to him on the limb of a tree
Football practice: she cheers him on, he throws up, she looks away for an instant, and Cartman tackles him.
Cafeteria: he throws up as she approaches; she slips in it and falls flat on her back
Playground: Stan and Kyle are working those hobby elephants furiously when Wendy and Bebe approach (he threw up on her thrice a time)
Woods: Stan and Wendy pucker up to kiss (after they got Ike back)"
[OTH],...Even when love is the same.
[OTH],"Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?"
Cartman,"Memememememe, me!"
[OTH],You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!
[OTH],"Stan, how about you?"
[OTH],Bluuch! I'd love to.
[OTH],"Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables."
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,What's a multiplication table?
[OTH],Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?
[OTH],"Well, where did he leave off?"
Cartman,We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while-
[OTH],"Oh, hello."
[OTH],Can I help you?
[OTH],I'm Chef.
[OTH],Aand?
[OTH],I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
[OTH],My laundry detergent?
[OTH],That's not Kyle's...
[OTH],Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.
[OTH],What was your name again?
Cartman,Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.
[OTH],I'mm the substitute.
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you."
[OTH],"That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-"
[OTH],"Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!"
[OTH],"We've got to learn how to do that, dude!"
[OTH],Yup!
[OTH],"That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?"
[OTH],If we can have dinner tonight.
[OTH],"Fine, Chef. Just let me do my job before I get fired."
Cartman,"Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!"
[OTH],Wwhat?!
[OTH],Mr. Garrison. Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],"Where-eh, where am I?"
[OTH],"The operation is over, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look?"
[OTH],You look great!
[OTH],Ah-I feel kinda nauseous.
[OTH],"Yes? Well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction, sawed through some bone, snapped some cartilage..."
[OTH],Aauugh-huh.
[OTH],...all the blood and mucus just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart.
[OTH],UUUUUuuuuuugh
[OTH],"By the way, did you ever see that movie Contact?"
[OTH],"Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Oh, stop, that movie was terrible!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest."
[OTH],I'll check on you a little later.
[OTH],"Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father!"
[OTH],"Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do."
Cartman,"Good-bye, Ms. Ellen."
[OTH],"Stop kissing ass, Cartman!"
Cartman,"I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut!"
[OTH],"Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?"
[OTH],"Of course, Wendy."
[OTH],"I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan."
[OTH],"Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life..."
[OTH],"Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?"
[OTH],"Of course, Wendy."
[OTH],Don't fuck with me!
[OTH],Wha?
[OTH],"You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!"
[OTH],"Bye, Ms. Ellen."
[OTH],"Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me."
[OTH],"Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle."
[OTH],"Pf-looser gift, pf-looser gift."
[OTH],"And here's one from Kenny. Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage."
[OTH],"Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan."
[OTH],Bluuch.
[OTH],"And here's another present...from Wendy. Oh. Why, it's a dead animal."
[OTH],"Thank you, Wendy."
[OTH],See? She liked my present the best!
[OTH],"Where's your present, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home."
[OTH],"Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now. But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner."
Cartman,"Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell."
[OTH],Are there any questions before we begin?
[OTH],"Yes, Wendy?"
[OTH],"When someone gets as old as you,"
[OTH],Do they have to wear Depends undergarments?
[OTH],Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
[OTH],No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
[OTH],"Hi, Stan."
[OTH],I bet I scored 100!
[OTH],"HI, STAN!"
[OTH],"Oh, hi, Wendy."
[OTH],"I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen."
[OTH],"No, she wasn't!"
[OTH],"Yes, she was!"
[OTH],That's impossible!
[OTH],"Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!"
Cartman,Nuh-uh!
[OTH],It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!
[OTH],Oh cool.
Cartman,"Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!"
[OTH],"Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy."
[OTH],NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!!
Cartman,"Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass."
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
Cartman,"Oh, hi, Chef."
[OTH],How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
[OTH],Not too good.
[OTH],What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
[OTH],"No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team."
[OTH],"Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion."
[OTH],Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.
[OTH],A whatbian?
[OTH],A plebeian?
[OTH],You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
[OTH],Kenny?
[OTH],"No, explain it to us, Chef."
[OTH],"Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Now move along, children, you're holding up the line!"
[OTH],"Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?"
[OTH],"Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!"
[OTH],"Hey, yeah!"
Cartman,"You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian."
[OTH],"You're just saying that, Cartman."
[OTH],"Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fat-ass."
Cartman,"I am, too!"
[OTH],"Okay, only a few more bandages to go."
[OTH],Well?
[OTH],Take a look for yourself.
[OTH],"Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],I think it looks great.
[OTH],Yes. I think once the swelling goes down you'll really notice the difference.
[OTH],"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?"
Cartman,My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect.
[OTH],And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
[OTH],I woke up very early one Sunday morn...
Cartman,This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
[OTH],"Hi, Mrs. Campbell."
[OTH],"Oh, How-dy Mr. Garrison. Se-hey, honey, you look kinda differe-hent-huh."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Did you get a haircut?
[OTH],"No, but thanks for asking."
[OTH],Call me! I'm in the book!
[OTH],"Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us."
[OTH],"Thanks for coming over, Bebe."
[OTH],"That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?"
[OTH],"That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover."
[OTH],"Oh, cool."
[OTH],I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
Cartman,I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
[OTH],"No, you're a fatter lesbian than me."
[OTH],"Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!"
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],Is that Wendy Testaburger?
[OTH],"Hi guys, what's up?"
Cartman,"Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John."
[OTH],"Wow. Hi, Wendy."
[OTH],"Oh. Hi, Stan."
[OTH],"I think it worked, Bebe."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Good morning, children."
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,Dang! That's nice!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!"
[OTH],We're like sisters!
[OTH],DIE!!
[OTH],"All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-"
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back."
Cartman,"Oh, weak, dude!"
[OTH],Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!
[OTH],"He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now."
[OTH],"Children, I have a very important announcement to make."
[OTH],I'm quitting my job as a teacher.
[OTH],Wwhat?
[OTH],"It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks."
[OTH],You...you can't.
[OTH],"But the good news is,"
[OTH],I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher.
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],That's right. Will you stay?
[OTH],Wel...sure!
[OTH],Noooo! Noooo!
[OTH],"Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan."
[OTH],Bluuch. Kick ass!
[OTH],Nooo!! Nooo!!
[OTH],"Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died."
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
[OTH],"Oh, my! What an exciting day!"
[OTH],"Great, baby, you're looking great!"
[OTH],"I'm a lady killer, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Okay, just a few hundred more shots and we'll be done!"
[OTH],A few hundred?
[OTH],"Hey, that's the life of a model, baby."
[OTH],"Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack."
[OTH],You've got it!
[OTH],"I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education."
[OTH],Are we making love now?
[OTH],Excuse me?
[OTH],They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
[OTH],What are you talking about?
[OTH],"You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says."
[OTH],"Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends."
[OTH],But why?
[OTH],"Well first of all, you're eight."
[OTH],"It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?"
[OTH],Oh boy.
[OTH],It's over. I give up.
[OTH],"Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],What the...?
[OTH],Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.
[OTH],Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself!
[OTH],So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Cartman,Did you make love?
[OTH],I think so.
Cartman,No way!
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Down by the fire?
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)
[OTH],Did I what?
[OTH],"Good morning, children."
[OTH],Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?
[OTH],"Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?"
[OTH],No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.
[OTH],"Oh, that's okay, Wendy."
[OTH],"No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends."
[OTH],"Well, I would love that, Wendy."
[OTH],"And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,"
[OTH],...and I've learned from it.
[OTH],"I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world."
[OTH],"Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!"
Cartman,That's not what we just heard!
[OTH],"Hoh, Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job."
[OTH],"Oh my God, did he...?"
[OTH],Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!!
[OTH],"We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting."
[OTH],Down! Down! Everybody down!
Cartman,What the hell...?
[OTH],"So! We meet again, Ms. Ellen!"
[OTH],"And just what is going on here, mister?"
[OTH],"I am Hakeem Korashki, of the mighty nation of Iraq! This woman is a traitor to our government!"
[OTH],It's a lie!
[OTH],"She has killed thousands, and will kill again, I assure you!"
[OTH],"Ms. Ellen, is this true?"
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],We must take her back to Iraq immediately!
[OTH],"Oh, coool!"
[OTH],"Principal Victoria, please."
[OTH],Here is a black-and-white photo of Ms. Ellen with our leader. Her real name is Makesh Alak Makarakesh.
[OTH],"Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!"
[OTH],NOOOO!!
[OTH],GET AWAY FROM ME!! UUGH!!
[OTH],"Oh my God, she killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],NOOOOOOO!!
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],What incredible irony.
[OTH],Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
[OTH],"Yeah, you just never know."
[OTH],"Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff."
[OTH],"Happy Valentine's Day, Staan."
[OTH],Bluuuuch!
[OTH],Eeewwww!
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],"No, it's okay, Stan!"
[OTH],Everything's going to be o-kay!
[OTH],"Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!"
Cartman,"Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box."
[OTH],"For crimes against this country, you are hereby sentenced to be shot into the center of the sun!"
[OTH],Egh.
[OTH],This is all a mistake!
[OTH],This can't be happening!
[OTH],Pleease! For the love of God!
[OTH],Shove off!!
[OTH],"Wo-hoo-hoo! Great party, Wendy!"
[OTH],"Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher."
[OTH],"Anything for you, sugar-pie!"
[OTH],"Oh, hi, Kyle!"
[OTH],"I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange."
[OTH],U-huh. Excuse me.
[OTH],Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!
[OTH],Ka fahra qetlaq humblaq!
[OTH],Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq!
[OTH],Kuhla shaluah lakhenblaturtulah!
[OTH],Kaqemblaq!
[OTH],"Ah, laqeh blakatah!"
[OTH],How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
[OTH],"Wait, wait!"
[OTH],It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe-box thing!
[OTH],"Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen."
[OTH],Wendy! You didn't!
[OTH],I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!
[OTH],"Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day."
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.
[OTH],"I can't afford a cruise, dude."
[OTH],"I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
Cartman,That is so-ho lame!
Cartman,"Oh man, I..."
[OTH],-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
Cartman,"Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time."
[OTH],"Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery."
[OTH],So you're going to have a substitute teacher.
[OTH],And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],"Yes, little boy?"
[OTH],We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],"...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen."
[OTH],"Hello, children."
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,"Wow, she's pretty."
[OTH],"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
[OTH],You can say that again.
[OTH],"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
[OTH],"Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay."
[OTH],Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.
[OTH],"Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,"
[OTH],...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us.
[OTH],Stan? Stan?!
[OTH],"Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?"
Cartman,"Yes, ma'am."
[OTH],Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.
[OTH],Yeu-bluuuch.
[OTH],"Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?"
Cartman,"Noh, he always pukes when he's in love."
[OTH],"I'll kick your ass, Cartman!"
[OTH],So you're alright?
[OTH],Bluuuch.
[OTH],"Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!"
[OTH],"Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes."
[OTH],"You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want."
[OTH],Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?
[OTH],"It sure is, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],"Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like this."
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],"Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this."
[OTH],"Oh, that's not bad."
[OTH],"Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this."
[OTH],WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
[OTH],Alright-y then.
[OTH],"Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food."
[OTH],I can live with that.
[OTH],"Alrighty then, let's get started!"
Cartman,"She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!"
[OTH],"Well that goes without saying, fat-ass, how could she help but look at you!"
[OTH],You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
Cartman,Until you puked on her.
[OTH],"Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?"
[OTH],"Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!"
[OTH],Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
[OTH],"Yeah, that one!"
[OTH],Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
[OTH],"Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],Well it is!
[OTH],That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
[OTH],"(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)"
[OTH],Thaat's right!
[OTH],"Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?"
[OTH],That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it...
[OTH],"Stan? We're still Valentines, right?"
[OTH],"Sure, Wendy, whatever."
[OTH],Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents
[OTH],Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!
Cartman,"I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners"
[OTH],"I remember when we were still in love
The moments that we shared were timeless.
Saw it in the wind, knew it in a glance,
the songs we sang were simple reminders."
[OTH],"Stark's Pond: she comes up behind him and says, ""Hi, Stan""
Stark's Pond: she asks him to come with her (to get Cartman)
Cafeteria: she hands him a note (an invitation to Stark's Pond)
Cemetery: amid a field of dead zombies, she puckers up
Classroom: she hands him a daisy (he throws up with every step she takes)"
[OTH],"I can't stop now My heart's awake
I feel your arms
My arms to take
I must have changed..."
[OTH],"A vivid sunset: she snuggles up to him on the limb of a tree
Football practice: she cheers him on, he throws up, she looks away for an instant, and Cartman tackles him.
Cafeteria: he throws up as she approaches; she slips in it and falls flat on her back
Playground: Stan and Kyle are working those hobby elephants furiously when Wendy and Bebe approach (he threw up on her thrice a time)
Woods: Stan and Wendy pucker up to kiss (after they got Ike back)"
[OTH],...Even when love is the same.
[OTH],"Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?"
Cartman,"Memememememe, me!"
[OTH],You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!
[OTH],"Stan, how about you?"
[OTH],Bluuch! I'd love to.
[OTH],"Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables."
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,What's a multiplication table?
[OTH],Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?
[OTH],"Well, where did he leave off?"
Cartman,We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while-
[OTH],"Oh, hello."
[OTH],Can I help you?
[OTH],I'm Chef.
[OTH],Aand?
[OTH],I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
[OTH],My laundry detergent?
[OTH],That's not Kyle's...
[OTH],Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.
[OTH],What was your name again?
Cartman,Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.
[OTH],I'mm the substitute.
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you."
[OTH],"That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-"
[OTH],"Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!"
[OTH],"We've got to learn how to do that, dude!"
[OTH],Yup!
[OTH],"That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?"
[OTH],If we can have dinner tonight.
[OTH],"Fine, Chef. Just let me do my job before I get fired."
Cartman,"Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!"
[OTH],Wwhat?!
[OTH],Mr. Garrison. Mr. Garrison.
[OTH],"Where-eh, where am I?"
[OTH],"The operation is over, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look?"
[OTH],You look great!
[OTH],Ah-I feel kinda nauseous.
[OTH],"Yes? Well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction, sawed through some bone, snapped some cartilage..."
[OTH],Aauugh-huh.
[OTH],...all the blood and mucus just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart.
[OTH],UUUUUuuuuuugh
[OTH],"By the way, did you ever see that movie Contact?"
[OTH],"Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Oh, stop, that movie was terrible!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest."
[OTH],I'll check on you a little later.
[OTH],"Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father!"
[OTH],"Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do."
Cartman,"Good-bye, Ms. Ellen."
[OTH],"Stop kissing ass, Cartman!"
Cartman,"I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut!"
[OTH],"Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?"
[OTH],"Of course, Wendy."
[OTH],"I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan."
[OTH],"Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life..."
[OTH],"Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?"
[OTH],"Of course, Wendy."
[OTH],Don't fuck with me!
[OTH],Wha?
[OTH],"You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!"
[OTH],"Bye, Ms. Ellen."
[OTH],"Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me."
[OTH],"Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle."
[OTH],"Pf-looser gift, pf-looser gift."
[OTH],"And here's one from Kenny. Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage."
[OTH],"Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan."
[OTH],Bluuch.
[OTH],"And here's another present...from Wendy. Oh. Why, it's a dead animal."
[OTH],"Thank you, Wendy."
[OTH],See? She liked my present the best!
[OTH],"Where's your present, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home."
[OTH],"Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now. But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner."
Cartman,"Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell."
[OTH],Are there any questions before we begin?
[OTH],"Yes, Wendy?"
[OTH],"When someone gets as old as you,"
[OTH],Do they have to wear Depends undergarments?
[OTH],Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
[OTH],No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
[OTH],"Hi, Stan."
[OTH],I bet I scored 100!
[OTH],"HI, STAN!"
[OTH],"Oh, hi, Wendy."
[OTH],"I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen."
[OTH],"No, she wasn't!"
[OTH],"Yes, she was!"
[OTH],That's impossible!
[OTH],"Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!"
Cartman,Nuh-uh!
[OTH],It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!
[OTH],Oh cool.
Cartman,"Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!"
[OTH],"Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy."
[OTH],NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!!
Cartman,"Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass."
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
Cartman,"Oh, hi, Chef."
[OTH],How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
[OTH],Not too good.
[OTH],What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
[OTH],"No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team."
[OTH],"Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion."
[OTH],Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.
[OTH],A whatbian?
[OTH],A plebeian?
[OTH],You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
[OTH],Kenny?
[OTH],"No, explain it to us, Chef."
[OTH],"Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Now move along, children, you're holding up the line!"
[OTH],"Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?"
[OTH],"Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!"
[OTH],"Hey, yeah!"
Cartman,"You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian."
[OTH],"You're just saying that, Cartman."
[OTH],"Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fat-ass."
Cartman,"I am, too!"
[OTH],"Okay, only a few more bandages to go."
[OTH],Well?
[OTH],Take a look for yourself.
[OTH],"Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],I think it looks great.
[OTH],Yes. I think once the swelling goes down you'll really notice the difference.
[OTH],"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?"
Cartman,My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect.
[OTH],And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
[OTH],I woke up very early one Sunday morn...
Cartman,This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
[OTH],"Hi, Mrs. Campbell."
[OTH],"Oh, How-dy Mr. Garrison. Se-hey, honey, you look kinda differe-hent-huh."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Did you get a haircut?
[OTH],"No, but thanks for asking."
[OTH],Call me! I'm in the book!
[OTH],"Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us."
[OTH],"Thanks for coming over, Bebe."
[OTH],"That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?"
[OTH],"That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover."
[OTH],"Oh, cool."
[OTH],I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
Cartman,I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
[OTH],"No, you're a fatter lesbian than me."
[OTH],"Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!"
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],Is that Wendy Testaburger?
[OTH],"Hi guys, what's up?"
Cartman,"Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John."
[OTH],"Wow. Hi, Wendy."
[OTH],"Oh. Hi, Stan."
[OTH],"I think it worked, Bebe."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Good morning, children."
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,Dang! That's nice!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!"
[OTH],We're like sisters!
[OTH],DIE!!
[OTH],"All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-"
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back."
Cartman,"Oh, weak, dude!"
[OTH],Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!
[OTH],"He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now."
[OTH],"Children, I have a very important announcement to make."
[OTH],I'm quitting my job as a teacher.
[OTH],Wwhat?
[OTH],"It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks."
[OTH],You...you can't.
[OTH],"But the good news is,"
[OTH],I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher.
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],That's right. Will you stay?
[OTH],Wel...sure!
[OTH],Noooo! Noooo!
[OTH],"Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan."
[OTH],Bluuch. Kick ass!
[OTH],Nooo!! Nooo!!
[OTH],"Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died."
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
[OTH],"Oh, my! What an exciting day!"
[OTH],"Great, baby, you're looking great!"
[OTH],"I'm a lady killer, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Okay, just a few hundred more shots and we'll be done!"
[OTH],A few hundred?
[OTH],"Hey, that's the life of a model, baby."
[OTH],"Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack."
[OTH],You've got it!
[OTH],"I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education."
[OTH],Are we making love now?
[OTH],Excuse me?
[OTH],They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
[OTH],What are you talking about?
[OTH],"You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says."
[OTH],"Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends."
[OTH],But why?
[OTH],"Well first of all, you're eight."
[OTH],"It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?"
[OTH],Oh boy.
[OTH],It's over. I give up.
[OTH],"Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],What the...?
[OTH],Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.
[OTH],Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself!
[OTH],So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Cartman,Did you make love?
[OTH],I think so.
Cartman,No way!
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Down by the fire?
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)
[OTH],Did I what?
[OTH],"Good morning, children."
[OTH],Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?
[OTH],"Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?"
[OTH],No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.
[OTH],"Oh, that's okay, Wendy."
[OTH],"No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends."
[OTH],"Well, I would love that, Wendy."
[OTH],"And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,"
[OTH],...and I've learned from it.
[OTH],"I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world."
[OTH],"Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!"
Cartman,That's not what we just heard!
[OTH],"Hoh, Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job."
[OTH],"Oh my God, did he...?"
[OTH],Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!!
[OTH],"We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting."
[OTH],Down! Down! Everybody down!
Cartman,What the hell...?
[OTH],"So! We meet again, Ms. Ellen!"
[OTH],"And just what is going on here, mister?"
[OTH],"I am Hakeem Korashki, of the mighty nation of Iraq! This woman is a traitor to our government!"
[OTH],It's a lie!
[OTH],"She has killed thousands, and will kill again, I assure you!"
[OTH],"Ms. Ellen, is this true?"
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],We must take her back to Iraq immediately!
[OTH],"Oh, coool!"
[OTH],"Principal Victoria, please."
[OTH],Here is a black-and-white photo of Ms. Ellen with our leader. Her real name is Makesh Alak Makarakesh.
[OTH],"Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!"
[OTH],NOOOO!!
[OTH],GET AWAY FROM ME!! UUGH!!
[OTH],"Oh my God, she killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],NOOOOOOO!!
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],What incredible irony.
[OTH],Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
[OTH],"Yeah, you just never know."
[OTH],"Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff."
[OTH],"Happy Valentine's Day, Staan."
[OTH],Bluuuuch!
[OTH],Eeewwww!
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],"No, it's okay, Stan!"
[OTH],Everything's going to be o-kay!
[OTH],"Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!"
Cartman,"Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box."
[OTH],"For crimes against this country, you are hereby sentenced to be shot into the center of the sun!"
[OTH],Egh.
[OTH],This is all a mistake!
[OTH],This can't be happening!
[OTH],Pleease! For the love of God!
[OTH],Shove off!!
[OTH],"Wo-hoo-hoo! Great party, Wendy!"
[OTH],"Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher."
[OTH],"Anything for you, sugar-pie!"
[OTH],"Oh, hi, Kyle!"
[OTH],"I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange."
[OTH],U-huh. Excuse me.
[OTH],Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!
[OTH],Ka fahra qetlaq humblaq!
[OTH],Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq!
[OTH],Kuhla shaluah lakhenblaturtulah!
[OTH],Kaqemblaq!
[OTH],"Ah, laqeh blakatah!"
[OTH],How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
[OTH],"Wait, wait!"
[OTH],It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe-box thing!
[OTH],"Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen."
[OTH],Wendy! You didn't!
[OTH],I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!
[OTH],"...And so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust. We dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month."
Cartman,Boooriing.
[OTH],"Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep."
[OTH],"Now, can anybody tell me, who left these arrowheads here?"
[OTH],Isn't that your job?
[OTH],"Well... yes, but I want to see if you're learning anything."
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"Okay, I tell you what. Why don't we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own Indian arrowheads."
Cartman,"Day is never finished,
Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free..."
[OTH],"Dude. Shut up, Cartman."
[OTH],Oh! Oh I think I found one!
Cartman,"No, I found it."
[OTH],Oh. I do believe I found it first.
Cartman,"No, I did, Pip."
[OTH],Oh dear.
Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it."
[OTH],What do you mean?
Cartman,"Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead."
[OTH],"Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must."
Cartman,"Okay, ready? I'll go first."
[OTH],"Well-uh I, I guess you win."
Cartman,"Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it."
Cartman,"Day is never finished,
Massa got me working...


Oh, look, I found another one."
Cartman,"Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle!"
[OTH],"Whoa. Check it out, dude."
[OTH],It's got little drawings on it.
[OTH],What is it?
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],That was cool!
Cartman,Eeyy! Give me that back!
[OTH],"You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now."
Cartman,We'll ro-sham-bo for it!
[OTH],"No way, fatty, it's mine!"
Cartman,ANTHROPOLOGIST!
[OTH],"How's it going, boys?"
Cartman,"I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!"
[OTH],"You threw it away, fatso!"
[OTH],"Hm, let me see that. Why, this is Anasazi writing! My God, this must be thousands of years old!"
Cartman,"Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it!"
[OTH],"...and finally tonight, a young boy from South Park, Colorado found something very interesting during a field trip today. Here with a special report is a quadriplegic Swiss man on a pony."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom, the little eight year old was very shocked indeed when he came across a very ancient triangular object."
[OTH],"Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'"
Cartman,"...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!"
[OTH],"You liar, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Screw you, triangle thief!"
[OTH],"And so, the little boy will take his discovery home and perhaps donate it to science... mwell a little later. Back to you, Dave."
[OTH],"Thanks Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he's a little tubby."
Cartman,Eeyy!
[OTH],"What are you going to do with it, dude?"
[OTH],"I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it."
Cartman,"Oh I'll find it, don't worry!"
Cartman,"God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously."
[OTH],"You did throw it away, Cartman."
Cartman,I was just setting it aside.
[OTH],"Well, you might as well let it go."
Cartman,Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
[OTH],"Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it..."
[OTH],"Excuse me, sir..."
[OTH],"Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV."
[OTH],"Leonard Maltin, yes."
[OTH],"Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at an Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef."
[OTH],"I know who you are. You must listen to me, Chef. We have precious little time. Have you seen Barbra Streisand recently?"
[OTH],"Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?"
[OTH],Have you seen her?!
[OTH],No. Not since Yentl.
[OTH],Thank God. Then I'm not too late.
[OTH],Too late for what?
[OTH],"Chef, it is of the utmost importance that you tell me where those little boys from the news report on TV are."
[OTH],Why do you care?
[OTH],I have a button we can use for his nose.
[OTH],"(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)"
[OTH],What would we use a marble sack for?
Cartman,Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
[OTH],I didn't steal anything.
Cartman,"Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?"
[OTH],Good!
Cartman,What's that noise?
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,Aaah! Aliens!
[OTH],Who is the boy I saw on the news report tonight?
[OTH],"Hello there, little boy. Do you know who I am?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Ugh. I bet you do.}}
I'm going-"
[OTH],Aagh! Stop that!
[OTH],-where there's lucky clovers in the f-
[OTH],"Ow, that sucks, dude!"
[OTH],I'm Barbra Streisand!
[OTH],...so?
[OTH],"So?! Uh muh, so I'm a very famous and very important individual."
[OTH],Like John Elway important?
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],D'you know John Elway?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!"
[OTH],"Ugh. Look. Little boy, I understand that you found a neat little triangle near here, you know what I'm talking about?"
[OTH],Yyeeaahh.
Cartman,"No! I found it, he stole it!"
[OTH],"You threw it away, Cartman!"
Cartman,"I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief."
[OTH],"Well, little boy, does the triangle have a symbol of two snakes joined at the middle?"
[OTH],Yeah. How'd you know?
[OTH],"Okay, now this is very important. Where is the triangle of Zinthar now?"
[OTH],Triangle of Zinthar?
[OTH],"Why do you wanta know, lady?!"
[OTH],"I'm not talking to you, you piss-ant little hick!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"Where is the triangle, dammit?!"
[OTH],AAAAAA!
[OTH],What seems to be the problemo here?
[OTH],"Problemo? Huh, There's no problemo, Officer. I was just introducing myself to these charming little boys."
Cartman,Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!
[OTH],"Boys, shouldn't you be in school?"
[OTH],It's Saturday.
[OTH],"No excuses, move along, you little troublemakers!"
[OTH],...Well?!
[OTH],Well what?
[OTH],"You know who I am, don't you?"
[OTH],"Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass!"
[OTH],Waaaaaaah!
[OTH],"Hoh, what a bitch!"
[OTH],"I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin."
[OTH],Damn! Then we must look for them elsewhere.
[OTH],"Come on, man. What is this all about?"
[OTH],"If Barbra Streisand saw the same report I did, then those boys are in grave danger. If you were Barbra Streisand, where would you be right now?"
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],"Nono! I mean, where would she be staying?"
[OTH],"Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope."
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a rumor.
[OTH],"Dammit man, where's your car?!"
[OTH],"He has it, Milo. That little bastard has the triangle."
[OTH],Are you sure?
[OTH],I'm sure! He knew about the symbol of Krewluck!
[OTH],Then why don't we go get it?
[OTH],A cop showed up - he's a clever one - I can't blow everything now that I'm this close. Everything must be handled very carefully.
[OTH],"How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand!"
[OTH],Cokeshen.
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,"You scared the crap out of me, Ike!"
[OTH],What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman,"I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?"
[OTH],Rear trohtru badt.
[OTH],"Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!"
[OTH],Cookeh monter.
Cartman,"Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddamn son of a bitch!!"
[OTH],Ahtoahtahneurah.
[OTH],"Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!"
Cartman,Huh?!
[OTH],"If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!"
[OTH],"There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!"
Cartman,"Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle. 
I got the triangle,
I got the triangle,
dee dun dee dun"
[OTH],Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here?
[OTH],It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.
[OTH],Then we've got to keep looking.
[OTH],"Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!"
[OTH],Haven't you ever been curious about the insanity Barbra Streisand exhibits?
[OTH],"Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-."
[OTH],"More than a bitch! She's a calculating, self-centered egotistical bitch! She was born in a small town, her mother was a jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman."
[OTH],Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?
[OTH],"When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer, but by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the universe. She learned of an ancient diamond, the Diamond of Pantheos."
[OTH],"Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!"
[OTH],Forget I asked!
[OTH],"Before she was seven the keepers of Pantheos learned of this insane little girl's wish. The diamond was split up, and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbra Streisand found one of the triangles."
[OTH],And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
[OTH],"Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets a hold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand!"
[OTH],"Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good."
[OTH],"Man, the bus sure is late."
Cartman,"Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle."
[OTH],Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
[OTH],"Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today?"
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person."
[OTH],I hear that one of you found my triangle.
[OTH],Your triangle?
[OTH],"Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours."
Cartman,Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!
[OTH],But I'll die.
Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can..."
[OTH],I want to give you a big cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me.
Cartman,It is?
[OTH],"Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it."
[OTH],"Oooh, hahahah. Who is that?"
[OTH],"Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45."
[OTH],"Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on."
Cartman,"Yeeh, stealth bombers."
Cartman,"Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-"
[OTH],ENOUGH!!
[OTH],"Oh, Haa-ha. Anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, I'll take you up to my condo where I'll kill you - I I mean-uh, uh give you - money - for the triangle."
Cartman,"Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass!"
[OTH],Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strangers?
Cartman,"No, not when money is involved, stupid!"
[OTH],And. Action!
[OTH],"Rebecca, I'm a man. A man like any other with dreams and emotions. And that's why I'll never put a foreign object up my ass."
[OTH],"Cut, great, print that. Excellent work, Sid. Take five, guys, let's set up for the next shot."
[OTH],Hello.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],You must hurry! A young man has found the Triangle of Zinthar.
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],At a small piss-ant white-bread mountain town in Colorado called South Park.
[OTH],Excellent!
[OTH],"Eh. Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will be mine, and I will be the biggest, most famous person ever!"
Cartman,Ugh. Let me go! Seriously!
[OTH],"Yeah, let us go!"
[OTH],You fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! I'll teach you to meddle with my triangle!
Cartman,"Eey! It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!"
[OTH],"Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fat-ass!"
Cartman,"Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh."
[OTH],Wheeere is the triangle of Zinthar?!
Cartman,I don't remember.
[OTH],Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!
[OTH],Maybe this will help jar your memory...
Cartman,No! Don't!
Cartman,AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!
[OTH],NOOOW do you remember?!
Cartman,"WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!"
[OTH],"Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude."
[OTH],"Alright. You asked for it! 
I'm gonna tell you now..."
[OTH],"Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all."
[OTH],"Well, looks like we'll have to go to plan B."
[OTH],"There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B."
[OTH],"Have you ever heard of the band called, The Cure?"
[OTH],"Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!"
[OTH],"No, no. Just the lead singer. Oh! Ah!"
[OTH],"Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?"
[OTH],She's close! She's very close-I can feel her.
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],"Sh-She has the boys! The, they're in trouble!"
[OTH],"Ooh, fudge!"
[OTH],Keep going this way! Hurry!
[OTH],Happiness with you is like happiness...
Cartman,"Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is, it's inside my shoe."
[OTH],"Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?"
Cartman,I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!
[OTH],"Finally, the triangle is mine! After centuries of waiting, I finally have the triangle of Zinthar! Now, the Diamond of Pantheos is complete."
[OTH],Sugoi! Kono hi wa... atarashii hajimari da! Ima kara... atashi no namae wa... (Wow! Today is... a new beginning! From now on... my name will be...)
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],...Mecha... Barbura... Sutoraisando!
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!"
[OTH],"...and so, just weeks after the devastating attack of mutant genetic creatures, zombies, and Thanksgiving turkeys, the town of South Park has managed to rebuild itself, once again be-"
[OTH],"Oh, Goddammit, not again!"
[OTH],"Bar-bura, Bar-bura... ...ichi ban kirai no hito. (the number 1 hateful person.) Bar-bura, Bar-bura... ...hana ga ookii. (...her nose is big.)"
[OTH],Mayor! Barbra Streisand is-
[OTH],I noticed! Call the National Guard!
[OTH],"Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch."
[OTH],And to think I actually watched your HBO special.
[OTH],Children!
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],Oh no! No! She has joined the two triangles?
Cartman,Yes! She stole my triangle!
[OTH],Get us down from here!
[OTH],I can't - break these - locks!
[OTH],"Stand back, Chef!"
[OTH],Marutam Re!
[OTH],"Whoa, that was cool!"
[OTH],"I've got to go after Mecha Streisand! Chef, I need you to call Robert Smith of The Cure at this number!"
[OTH],Robert Smith? Sweet!
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?"
[OTH],"Yes, i' is."
[OTH],"This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you."
[OTH],"Ooooooh so Barbra Streisand's found the other triangle, eh?"
[OTH],"All right, men, give 'er everything you've got!"
[OTH],"Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here."
[OTH],Okay. Aah! aah! I'm scaared!
[OTH],"Bar-bura, Bar-bura, sugoi na bitchu da.
(Barbra, Barbra, she's a huge bitch.)"
[OTH],It's no use! Our firepower has no effect!
[OTH],"Oh my God, it is you! Oh, I am such a huge fan, Ms. Streisand. I never thought I'd live to see you in person!"
[OTH],"I hate to ask this, but could I get an autograph? My sister would die."
[OTH],"Oh thank you, Ms. Streisand!"
[OTH],Oh my Goooodd!
[OTH],"We're doomed! Good-bye, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"Bar-bura, Bar-bura!"
[OTH],Barbra!
[OTH],"Kite, Kite. Churipu. (Come, come. Tulip!)"
[OTH],Ultura Lenardu Marutin!
[OTH],"Look out, children!"

[OTH],(Ugh!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],What's going on here?
[OTH],Sidney Poitier?
[OTH],That's right. I'm Sidney Poitier.
[OTH],"Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!"
[OTH],Barbra Streisand has found the triangle of Zinthar?
[OTH],Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
[OTH],Kolooh kulatchki!
[OTH],"Mega Poatia,
Mega Poatia,

(Megara Poatia Megara Poatia. Look, how black you are.) Mega Poatia, Mega Poatia-"
[OTH],Is that really necessary?
[OTH],"It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town."
Cartman,Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her!
[OTH],"My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?"
[OTH],We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
[OTH],"Oh my Goooood, help meeee!"
[OTH],Am I too late?
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
Cartman,Sweet!
[OTH],"Here, you boys hold this walkie, you can help me fight her."
[OTH],"You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier."
[OTH],I have to try. I can't let Barbra Streisand do this to the entire world.
[OTH],"Rabartu Smisu,
Rabartu Smisu,
tashiwa daisuki Rabartu Smisu.
(Robert Smith, Robert Smith, I like you a lot, Robert Smith)"
[OTH],We must tell him that her weak point is the nose.
[OTH],"Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch."
[OTH],The Diamond of Pantheos. She must be powerless now.
[OTH],"Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!"
[OTH],"Rabartu Smisu,
Rabartu Smisu!"
[OTH],He did it!
[OTH],"No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!"
[OTH],Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
[OTH],Our Savior!
[OTH],"Can I have my walkie-talkie back now, please?"
Cartman,No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!
[OTH],"Alright, I'll ro-sham-bo you for it. Ready?"
Cartman,Huh?
Cartman,Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah!
[OTH],Hey! Where's he goin'?
[OTH],"Good-bye, Robert Smith!"
Cartman,Thanks for your help! Visit us again!
[OTH],Disintegration is the best album everrr!
[OTH],"Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?"
[OTH],We've got to get rid of them.
[OTH],Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted!
[OTH],"Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me."
Cartman,"No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!"
[OTH],"Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?!"
Cartman,"Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll ro-sham-bo you for it!"
[OTH],"Go to hell, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Well, that whole experience sure did suck."
[OTH],Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
[OTH],"But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!"
Cartman,Oh no! She's back!
[OTH],Oh my God! Look!
[OTH],AAAAA! MECHA IKE!
[OTH],"...And so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust. We dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month."
Cartman,Boooriing.
[OTH],"Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep."
[OTH],"Now, can anybody tell me, who left these arrowheads here?"
[OTH],Isn't that your job?
[OTH],"Well... yes, but I want to see if you're learning anything."
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"Okay, I tell you what. Why don't we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own Indian arrowheads."
Cartman,"Day is never finished,
Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free..."
[OTH],"Dude. Shut up, Cartman."
[OTH],Oh! Oh I think I found one!
Cartman,"No, I found it."
[OTH],Oh. I do believe I found it first.
Cartman,"No, I did, Pip."
[OTH],Oh dear.
Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it."
[OTH],What do you mean?
Cartman,"Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead."
[OTH],"Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must."
Cartman,"Okay, ready? I'll go first."
[OTH],"Well-uh I, I guess you win."
Cartman,"Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it."
Cartman,"Day is never finished,
Massa got me working...


Oh, look, I found another one."
Cartman,"Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle!"
[OTH],"Whoa. Check it out, dude."
[OTH],It's got little drawings on it.
[OTH],What is it?
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],That was cool!
Cartman,Eeyy! Give me that back!
[OTH],"You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now."
Cartman,We'll ro-sham-bo for it!
[OTH],"No way, fatty, it's mine!"
Cartman,ANTHROPOLOGIST!
[OTH],"How's it going, boys?"
Cartman,"I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!"
[OTH],"You threw it away, fatso!"
[OTH],"Hm, let me see that. Why, this is Anasazi writing! My God, this must be thousands of years old!"
Cartman,"Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it!"
[OTH],"...and finally tonight, a young boy from South Park, Colorado found something very interesting during a field trip today. Here with a special report is a quadriplegic Swiss man on a pony."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom, the little eight year old was very shocked indeed when he came across a very ancient triangular object."
[OTH],"Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'"
Cartman,"...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!"
[OTH],"You liar, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Screw you, triangle thief!"
[OTH],"And so, the little boy will take his discovery home and perhaps donate it to science... mwell a little later. Back to you, Dave."
[OTH],"Thanks Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he's a little tubby."
Cartman,Eeyy!
[OTH],"What are you going to do with it, dude?"
[OTH],"I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it."
Cartman,"Oh I'll find it, don't worry!"
Cartman,"God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously."
[OTH],"You did throw it away, Cartman."
Cartman,I was just setting it aside.
[OTH],"Well, you might as well let it go."
Cartman,Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
[OTH],"Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it..."
[OTH],"Excuse me, sir..."
[OTH],"Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV."
[OTH],"Leonard Maltin, yes."
[OTH],"Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at an Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef."
[OTH],"I know who you are. You must listen to me, Chef. We have precious little time. Have you seen Barbra Streisand recently?"
[OTH],"Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?"
[OTH],Have you seen her?!
[OTH],No. Not since Yentl.
[OTH],Thank God. Then I'm not too late.
[OTH],Too late for what?
[OTH],"Chef, it is of the utmost importance that you tell me where those little boys from the news report on TV are."
[OTH],Why do you care?
[OTH],I have a button we can use for his nose.
[OTH],"(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)"
[OTH],What would we use a marble sack for?
Cartman,Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
[OTH],I didn't steal anything.
Cartman,"Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?"
[OTH],Good!
Cartman,What's that noise?
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,Aaah! Aliens!
[OTH],Who is the boy I saw on the news report tonight?
[OTH],"Hello there, little boy. Do you know who I am?"

[OTH],"Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!"
[OTH],"Ugh. Look. Little boy, I understand that you found a neat little triangle near here, you know what I'm talking about?"
[OTH],Yyeeaahh.
Cartman,"No! I found it, he stole it!"
[OTH],"You threw it away, Cartman!"
Cartman,"I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief."
[OTH],"Well, little boy, does the triangle have a symbol of two snakes joined at the middle?"
[OTH],Yeah. How'd you know?
[OTH],"Okay, now this is very important. Where is the triangle of Zinthar now?"
[OTH],Triangle of Zinthar?
[OTH],"Why do you wanta know, lady?!"

[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"Where is the triangle, dammit?!"

[OTH],"Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope."
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a rumor.
[OTH],"Dammit man, where's your car?!"
[OTH],"He has it, Milo. That little bastard has the triangle."
[OTH],Are you sure?
[OTH],I'm sure! He knew about the symbol of Krewluck!
[OTH],Then why don't we go get it?
[OTH],A cop showed up - he's a clever one - I can't blow everything now that I'm this close. Everything must be handled very carefully.
[OTH],"How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand!"
[OTH],Cokeshen.
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,"You scared the crap out of me, Ike!"
[OTH],What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman,"I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?"

Cartman,Huh?!

[OTH],"There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!"
Cartman,"Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle. 
I got the triangle,
I got the triangle,

[OTH],Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here?
[OTH],It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.

[OTH],And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
[OTH],"Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets a hold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand!"
[OTH],"Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good."
[OTH],"Man, the bus sure is late."
Cartman,"Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle."
[OTH],Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
[OTH],"Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today?"
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person."
[OTH],I hear that one of you found my triangle.
[OTH],Your triangle?
[OTH],"Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours."
Cartman,Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!
[OTH],But I'll die.
Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can..."
[OTH],I want to give you a big cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me.
Cartman,It is?
[OTH],"Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it."
[OTH],"Oooh, hahahah. Who is that?"
[OTH],"Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45."
[OTH],"Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on."
Cartman,"Yeeh, stealth bombers."
Cartman,"Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-"
[OTH],ENOUGH!!
[OTH],"Oh, Haa-ha. Anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, I'll take you up to my condo where I'll kill you - I I mean-uh, uh give you - money - for the triangle."
Cartman,"Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass!"
[OTH],Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strangers?
Cartman,"No, not when money is involved, stupid!"
[OTH],And. Action!
[OTH],"Rebecca, I'm a man. A man like any other with dreams and emotions. And that's why I'll never put a foreign object up my ass."
[OTH],"Cut, great, print that. Excellent work, Sid. Take five, guys, let's set up for the next shot."
[OTH],Hello.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],You must hurry! A young man has found the Triangle of Zinthar.
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],At a small piss-ant white-bread mountain town in Colorado called South Park.
[OTH],Excellent!
[OTH],"Eh. Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will be mine, and I will be the biggest, most famous person ever!"
Cartman,Ugh. Let me go! Seriously!
[OTH],"Yeah, let us go!"
[OTH],You fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! I'll teach you to meddle with my triangle!
Cartman,"Eey! It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!"
[OTH],"Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fat-ass!"
Cartman,"Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh."
[OTH],Wheeere is the triangle of Zinthar?!
Cartman,I don't remember.
[OTH],Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!
[OTH],Maybe this will help jar your memory...
Cartman,No! Don't!
Cartman,AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!
[OTH],NOOOW do you remember?!
Cartman,"WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!"
[OTH],"Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude."
[OTH],"Alright. You asked for it! 
I'm gonna tell you now..."
[OTH],"Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all."
[OTH],"Well, looks like we'll have to go to plan B."
[OTH],"There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B."
[OTH],"Have you ever heard of the band called, The Cure?"
[OTH],"Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!"
[OTH],"No, no. Just the lead singer. Oh! Ah!"
[OTH],"Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?"
[OTH],She's close! She's very close-I can feel her.
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],"Sh-She has the boys! The, they're in trouble!"
[OTH],"Ooh, fudge!"
[OTH],Keep going this way! Hurry!
[OTH],Happiness with you is like happiness...
Cartman,"Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is, it's inside my shoe."
[OTH],"Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?"
Cartman,I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!
[OTH],"Finally, the triangle is mine! After centuries of waiting, I finally have the triangle of Zinthar! Now, the Diamond of Pantheos is complete."
[OTH],Sugoi! Kono hi wa... atarashii hajimari da! Ima kara... atashi no namae wa... (Wow! Today is... a new beginning! From now on... my name will be...)
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],...Mecha... Barbura... Sutoraisando!
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!"
[OTH],"...and so, just weeks after the devastating attack of mutant genetic creatures, zombies, and Thanksgiving turkeys, the town of South Park has managed to rebuild itself, once again be-"
[OTH],"Oh, Goddammit, not again!"
[OTH],"Bar-bura, Bar-bura... ...ichi ban kirai no hito. (the number 1 hateful person.) Bar-bura, Bar-bura... ...hana ga ookii. (...her nose is big.)"
[OTH],Mayor! Barbra Streisand is-
[OTH],I noticed! Call the National Guard!
[OTH],"Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch."
[OTH],And to think I actually watched your HBO special.
[OTH],Children!
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],Oh no! No! She has joined the two triangles?
Cartman,Yes! She stole my triangle!
[OTH],Get us down from here!
[OTH],I can't - break these - locks!
[OTH],"Stand back, Chef!"
[OTH],Marutam Re!
[OTH],"Whoa, that was cool!"
[OTH],"I've got to go after Mecha Streisand! Chef, I need you to call Robert Smith of The Cure at this number!"
[OTH],Robert Smith? Sweet!
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?"
[OTH],"Yes, i' is."
[OTH],"This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you."
[OTH],"Ooooooh so Barbra Streisand's found the other triangle, eh?"
[OTH],"All right, men, give 'er everything you've got!"
[OTH],"Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here."
[OTH],Okay. Aah! aah! I'm scaared!
[OTH],"Bar-bura, Bar-bura, sugoi na bitchu da.
(Barbra, Barbra, she's a huge bitch.)"
[OTH],It's no use! Our firepower has no effect!
[OTH],"Oh my God, it is you! Oh, I am such a huge fan, Ms. Streisand. I never thought I'd live to see you in person!"
[OTH],"I hate to ask this, but could I get an autograph? My sister would die."
[OTH],"Oh thank you, Ms. Streisand!"
[OTH],Oh my Goooodd!
[OTH],"We're doomed! Good-bye, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"Bar-bura, Bar-bura!"
[OTH],Barbra!
[OTH],"Kite, Kite. Churipu. (Come, come. Tulip!)"
[OTH],Ultura Lenardu Marutin!
[OTH],"Look out, children!"
[OTH],(Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!)
[OTH],(Ugh!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],What's going on here?
[OTH],Sidney Poitier?
[OTH],That's right. I'm Sidney Poitier.
[OTH],"Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!"
[OTH],Barbra Streisand has found the triangle of Zinthar?
[OTH],Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
[OTH],Kolooh kulatchki!
[OTH],"Mega Poatia,
Mega Poatia,
sogoi kuroi da ne.
(Megara Poatia Megara Poatia. Look, how black you are.) Mega Poatia, Mega Poatia-"
[OTH],Is that really necessary?
[OTH],"It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town."
Cartman,Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her!
[OTH],"My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?"
[OTH],We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
[OTH],"Oh my Goooood, help meeee!"
[OTH],Am I too late?
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
Cartman,Sweet!
[OTH],"Here, you boys hold this walkie, you can help me fight her."
[OTH],"You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier."
[OTH],I have to try. I can't let Barbra Streisand do this to the entire world.
[OTH],"Rabartu Smisu,
Rabartu Smisu,
tashiwa daisuki Rabartu Smisu.
(Robert Smith, Robert Smith, I like you a lot, Robert Smith)"
[OTH],We must tell him that her weak point is the nose.
[OTH],"Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch."
[OTH],The Diamond of Pantheos. She must be powerless now.
[OTH],"Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!"
[OTH],"Rabartu Smisu,
Rabartu Smisu!"
[OTH],He did it!
[OTH],"No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!"
[OTH],Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
[OTH],Our Savior!
[OTH],"Can I have my walkie-talkie back now, please?"
Cartman,No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!
[OTH],"Alright, I'll ro-sham-bo you for it. Ready?"
Cartman,Huh?
Cartman,Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah!
[OTH],Hey! Where's he goin'?
[OTH],"Good-bye, Robert Smith!"
Cartman,Thanks for your help! Visit us again!
[OTH],Disintegration is the best album everrr!
[OTH],"Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?"
[OTH],We've got to get rid of them.
[OTH],Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted!
[OTH],"Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me."
Cartman,"No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!"
[OTH],"Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?!"
Cartman,"Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll ro-sham-bo you for it!"
[OTH],"Go to hell, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Well, that whole experience sure did suck."
[OTH],Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
[OTH],"But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!"
Cartman,Oh no! She's back!
[OTH],Oh my God! Look!
[OTH],AAAAA! MECHA IKE!
[OTH],"Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school."
[OTH],Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
[OTH],"(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed.)"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
[OTH],"Come on, we're running late!"
[OTH],"We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!"
[OTH],What did you say?!
[OTH],"I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch."
[OTH],"Oh. Alright, then."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude."
[OTH],I always wondered if that would work.
[OTH],"Hello, boys."
[OTH],"Hi. We were wondering why fat-ass I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school."
[OTH],"Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard."
[OTH],In the backyard?
Cartman,"Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?"
[OTH],"Yes, Eric, I would like some tea. Thank you."
Cartman,"You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants."
Cartman,"Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?"
[OTH],"Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?"
Cartman,"Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am."
[OTH],"You are so strong and smart, Eric. Everybody likes you."
Cartman,"Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you."
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea.)"
[OTH],Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
[OTH],"No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea."
Cartman,"Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey."
[OTH],Eric is the best!
[OTH],Hooray for Eric!
[OTH],Eric kicks ass!
[OTH],"Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman."
[OTH],"Oh, well, there's a news flash!"
[OTH],Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
[OTH],Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
[OTH],"Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay?"
[OTH],Woo-whataya mean?
[OTH],Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well-obviously something is bothering him. Oh, of course!"
[OTH],"My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay?"
[OTH],Is that legal?
[OTH],"Oh, hell yes!"
Cartman,"My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants."
[OTH],"Oh, thank you, Eric. You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and true."
[OTH],"Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much."
Cartman,"That's niiice, Peter Panda."
[OTH],"Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made."
[OTH],How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
[OTH],"I donnow, just keep rolling."
Cartman,"More tea, Rumpertumskin?"
[OTH],"Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome."
Cartman,"Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?"
[OTH],I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
Cartman,Eeeyy!
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!"
[OTH],Hhhhhcck!
[OTH],"How is your beefy roast, snookums?"
Cartman,Mom? Can I ask you a question?
[OTH],"Sure, hon."
Cartman,"You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?"
[OTH],Uh huuuh.
Cartman,"And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?"
[OTH],Yyeess??
[OTH],"Well, what's your question, hon?"
Cartman,God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
[OTH],Oooooohh.
Cartman,I want to know where I came from.
[OTH],"Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other."
Cartman,Uh huuh.
[OTH],And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha.
Cartman,So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
[OTH],"Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance."
[OTH],I was young and naive then...
[OTH],"Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman."
[OTH],"Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he. I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?!"
[OTH],"I wouldn't mind gettin' ahold of your cookies, Ms. Cartman!"
[OTH],"Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],"Mm, that's a good cookie!"
[OTH],"Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance!"
[OTH],"And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water."
[OTH],"There you are, like a throbbing star. I want you to make love to me."
[OTH],"I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin."
Cartman,"So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?"
[OTH],Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
Cartman,"That isn't a very romantic story, Mom."
[OTH],I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
Cartman,Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!"
[OTH],"Coming this Sunday, a major television event that will blow you away. Terrance. Phillip."
[OTH],"In the harrowing made-for-TV drama, Not Without My Anus, based on a true story."
[OTH],"Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter."
[OTH],"Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance."
[OTH],See Canada's hottest stars on the HBC movie of the week.
[OTH],"Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. It looks riveting."
[OTH],Come on Grandpa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
[OTH],"No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show."
[OTH],Aaawww.
[OTH],Hunh?
[OTH],"And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos. Here is you host, Bob Saget!"
[OTH],"Hey, I just flew into the studio."
[OTH],Boy are my arms tired. Heheh. Heh.
[OTH],"Wha, Why didn't the skeleton cross the road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts."
[OTH],Knock knock.
[OTH],Bob.
[OTH],Bob Saget..
[OTH],This guy sucks!
[OTH],Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
[OTH],Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
Cartman,"Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people."
[OTH],What??
Cartman,Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!
Cartman,"Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation."
[OTH],"What are you talking about, Cartman?!"
Cartman,"My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?"
[OTH],"Go ahead, dude."
[OTH],Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
[OTH],"Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!"
[OTH],"Just a free li'l reminder to all of you out there: send us your stupidest home videos. Grand prize for this month will be $10,000."
[OTH],Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.
[OTH],"Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video."
[OTH],...And Bear cried to Eagle-
[OTH],"Running Water, there is some kid here to see you."
[OTH],What kid?
[OTH],He claims to be your kid.
Cartman,"Hiya, Dad!"
[OTH],Who the hell are you?
Cartman,"I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance."
[OTH],Your mother?
Cartman,Liane Cartman.
[OTH],"Cartman? Hohoho. Oh boy, I was worried there for a second. Look, kid, I'm not your father."
Cartman,But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
[OTH],"Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'"
Cartman,Whatooya mean?
[OTH],"She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'"
Cartman,Huh??
[OTH],Your mom's a slut.
Cartman,Eeyy!!
[OTH],Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you.
[OTH],"We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot."
[OTH],There you are...
[OTH],"I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things."
[OTH],"Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder."
[OTH],"Whoa, Helloooh!!"
[OTH],Wait. Wait.
[OTH],] Who is that?
[OTH],There you are like a throbbing star-
[OTH],Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],You gotta be kidding me.
[OTH],Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before.
[OTH],Nawh. I'm new in town.
[OTH],"Well, what's a nice, handsome, black man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?"
[OTH],I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
[OTH],"Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?"
[OTH],"Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?"
[OTH],"Ahah, I'm plastered!"
Cartman,His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??
[OTH],He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.
Cartman,Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
[OTH],"Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it."
[OTH],Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
[OTH],Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
[OTH],"If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs."
[OTH],Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
Cartman,"'S up, homies?"
[OTH],Cartman?!
Cartman,I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
[OTH],"You live on the Eastside, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Dude, I thought you said you were Native American."
Cartman,Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.
Cartman,You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
[OTH],"Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000."
[OTH],(Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)
[OTH],"Hold on, Kenny!"
[OTH],(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-
[OTH],(AARGH.)
[OTH],"(Goddamn, why-)"
[OTH],(Oh this freakin'-)
[OTH],(AARGH.)
[OTH],(Phew.)
[OTH],"(Well, I'm fine, guys!)"
[OTH],(Now if I can-)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny."
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],Hello?
Cartman,"Yo, Pops!"
[OTH],"Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?"
Cartman,"You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?"
[OTH],Get in here!
Cartman,Westsa-eed-eh.
[OTH],Take that wig off! What's gotten into you?!
Cartman,"You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance."
[OTH],"What?! Noh! Uh, did I?"
Cartman,He said you kissed her with your tongue.
[OTH],"Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children."
Cartman,Huho. So you're not my dad?
[OTH],"Of course not. Here. You children sit down,"
[OTH],"...and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.

When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen,
and the two take off their clothes,
that's right,
And they caress and touch each other,
until the part of the man grows,
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot,
And the man says ""I love you"" and the woman says ""hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom""
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait... ...and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says,
""Baby, I'm gettin' hot!""
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of..."
Cartman,What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
[OTH],"Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember."
[OTH],"Whoa, Chef! You're so strong!"
[OTH],"Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos!"
[OTH],Are we late for the party?
[OTH],What the hell town is this?
[OTH],"There you are, like a throbbing star. I want-"
[OTH],"Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!"
[OTH],"Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!"
[OTH],Woooh! Whooppee!! Unhh!
[OTH],Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
[OTH],"You're drunk, Mr. Hat!"
[OTH],There you are-
[OTH],"Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!"
[OTH],"Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a menage o'three?"
[OTH],Yeah! When two women are involved.
[OTH],"Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman."
[OTH],And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
Cartman,"No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!"
[OTH],"And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-"
[OTH],Here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.
Cartman,"Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend."
[OTH],"I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all."
Cartman,Really? You don't think so?
[OTH],"Naw, you're not fat."
Cartman,"Gee, that's kewl."
[OTH],"Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning."
[OTH],Huh? Oh yeah.
[OTH],"Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?"
[OTH],How 'bout some ice cream?
[OTH],"Yeah, with butterscotch."
[OTH],"You bet, you poor dears."
[OTH],"Now, the moment you've all been waiting for, when one of our lucky videos qualifies for the $10,000 Grand Prize to be chosen tomorrow night! The winner is Little Boy's Tea Party."
[OTH],Woohoo!
[OTH],"Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!"
[OTH],"We're gonna win $10,000!"
[OTH],Man! Cartman's gonna be famous!
[OTH],"Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem! Another Cosmo, please."
Cartman,"All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!"
[OTH],"What the hell are you talking about, Eric?"
Cartman,It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay.
[OTH],I am not gay!
Cartman,Then you did sleep with my mom?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],He's gay!!
[OTH],"Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!"
[OTH],"Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman?"
[OTH],Oooooh.
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],I haven't.
[OTH],"...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!"
[OTH],Oh. Yeah.
[OTH],"So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know."
[OTH],"Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean."
[OTH],"Wait, wait. I know a way to find out."
Cartman,How?
[OTH],"At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is."
Cartman,Really? You can?
[OTH],"Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but..."
Cartman,How much?
[OTH],Three thousand should cover it.
Cartman,I don't have $3000.
[OTH],Oh. Never mind.
[OTH],"Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever."

Cartman,Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.
[OTH],"Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000."
[OTH],"Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude."
Cartman,"Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh..."
Cartman,"Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while."
[OTH],"Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000."

Cartman,Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!
[OTH],"All right. From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef , Jimbo , Mr. Garrison , Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski , myself, my friend Kevin , or, the 1989 Denver Broncos."
[OTH],"Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!"
[OTH],The test results are in this envelope.
[OTH],Shall I... open it?
[OTH],"Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!"
[OTH],"Erhum ehrum uh The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-"
[OTH],Who is Eric Cartman's father? Is it - Chief Running Water? Or is it - Chef? Is it Mephesto? Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? Or is it Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],Nope. He's gay.
[OTH],You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
[OTH],Is it Jimbo?
[OTH],Daaagh!
[OTH],Or is Officer Barbrady?
[OTH],Huh?! Where?!
[OTH],Or could it be Ned?
[OTH],Could be.
[OTH],Or Mr. Broflovski??
[OTH],"Dad, how could you?!"
[OTH],"Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? The answer is coming on an all-new South Park, in just four weeks."
Cartman,What?! Son of a bitch!
[OTH],"Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school."
[OTH],Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
[OTH],"(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed.)"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
[OTH],"Come on, we're running late!"
[OTH],"We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!"
[OTH],What did you say?!
[OTH],"I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch."
[OTH],"Oh. Alright, then."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude."
[OTH],I always wondered if that would work.
[OTH],"Hello, boys."
[OTH],"Hi. We were wondering why fat-ass I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school."
[OTH],"Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard."
[OTH],In the backyard?
Cartman,"Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?"
[OTH],"Yes, Eric, I would like some tea. Thank you."
Cartman,"You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants."
Cartman,"Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?"
[OTH],"Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?"
Cartman,"Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am."
[OTH],"You are so strong and smart, Eric. Everybody likes you."
Cartman,"Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you."
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea.)"
[OTH],Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
[OTH],"No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea."
Cartman,"Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey."
[OTH],Eric is the best!
[OTH],Hooray for Eric!
[OTH],Eric kicks ass!
[OTH],"Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman."
[OTH],"Oh, well, there's a news flash!"
[OTH],Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
[OTH],Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
[OTH],"Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay?"
[OTH],Woo-whataya mean?
[OTH],Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well-obviously something is bothering him. Oh, of course!"
[OTH],"My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay?"
[OTH],Is that legal?
[OTH],"Oh, hell yes!"
Cartman,"My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants."
[OTH],"Oh, thank you, Eric. You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and true."
[OTH],"Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much."
Cartman,"That's niiice, Peter Panda."
[OTH],"Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made."
[OTH],How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
[OTH],"I donnow, just keep rolling."
Cartman,"More tea, Rumpertumskin?"
[OTH],"Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome."
Cartman,"Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?"
[OTH],I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
Cartman,Eeeyy!
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!"
[OTH],Hhhhhcck!
[OTH],"How is your beefy roast, snookums?"
Cartman,Mom? Can I ask you a question?
[OTH],"Sure, hon."
Cartman,"You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?"
[OTH],Uh huuuh.
Cartman,"And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?"
[OTH],Yyeess??
[OTH],"Well, what's your question, hon?"
Cartman,God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
[OTH],Oooooohh.
Cartman,I want to know where I came from.
[OTH],"Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other."
Cartman,Uh huuh.
[OTH],And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha.
Cartman,So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
[OTH],"Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance."
[OTH],I was young and naive then...
[OTH],"Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman."
[OTH],"Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he. I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?!"
[OTH],"I wouldn't mind gettin' ahold of your cookies, Ms. Cartman!"
[OTH],"Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],"Mm, that's a good cookie!"
[OTH],"Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance!"
[OTH],"And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water."
[OTH],"There you are, like a throbbing star. I want you to make love to me."
[OTH],"I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin."
Cartman,"So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?"
[OTH],Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
Cartman,"That isn't a very romantic story, Mom."
[OTH],I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
Cartman,Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!"
[OTH],"Coming this Sunday, a major television event that will blow you away. Terrance. Phillip."
[OTH],"In the harrowing made-for-TV drama, Not Without My Anus, based on a true story."
[OTH],"Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter."
[OTH],"Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance."
[OTH],See Canada's hottest stars on the HBC movie of the week.
[OTH],"Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!"

[OTH],Aaawww.
[OTH],Hunh?
[OTH],"And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos. Here is you host, Bob Saget!"
[OTH],"Hey, I just flew into the studio."
[OTH],Boy are my arms tired. Heheh. Heh.
[OTH],"Wha, Why didn't the skeleton cross the road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts."
[OTH],Knock knock.
[OTH],Bob.
[OTH],Bob Saget..
[OTH],This guy sucks!
[OTH],Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
[OTH],Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
Cartman,"Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people."
[OTH],What??
Cartman,Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!
Cartman,"Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation."
[OTH],"What are you talking about, Cartman?!"
Cartman,"My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?"
[OTH],"Go ahead, dude."
[OTH],Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
[OTH],"Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!"
[OTH],"Just a free li'l reminder to all of you out there: send us your stupidest home videos. Grand prize for this month will be $10,000."
[OTH],Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.
[OTH],"Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video."
[OTH],...And Bear cried to Eagle-
[OTH],"Running Water, there is some kid here to see you."
[OTH],What kid?
[OTH],He claims to be your kid.
Cartman,"Hiya, Dad!"
[OTH],Who the hell are you?
Cartman,"I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance."
[OTH],Your mother?
Cartman,Liane Cartman.
[OTH],"Cartman? Hohoho. Oh boy, I was worried there for a second. Look, kid, I'm not your father."
Cartman,But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
[OTH],"Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'"
Cartman,Whatooya mean?
[OTH],"She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'"
Cartman,Huh??
[OTH],Your mom's a slut.
Cartman,Eeyy!!
[OTH],Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you.
[OTH],"We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot."
[OTH],There you are...
[OTH],"I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things."
[OTH],"Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder."
[OTH],"Whoa, Helloooh!!"
[OTH],Wait. Wait.
[OTH],] Who is that?
[OTH],There you are like a throbbing star-
[OTH],Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],You gotta be kidding me.
[OTH],Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before.
[OTH],Nawh. I'm new in town.
[OTH],"Well, what's a nice, handsome, black man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?"
[OTH],I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
[OTH],"Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?"
[OTH],"Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?"
[OTH],"Ahah, I'm plastered!"
Cartman,His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??
[OTH],He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.
Cartman,Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
[OTH],"Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it."
[OTH],Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
[OTH],Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
[OTH],"If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs."
[OTH],Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
Cartman,"'S up, homies?"
[OTH],Cartman?!
Cartman,I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
[OTH],"You live on the Eastside, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Dude, I thought you said you were Native American."
Cartman,Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.
Cartman,You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
[OTH],"Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000."
[OTH],(Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)
[OTH],"Hold on, Kenny!"
[OTH],(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-
[OTH],(AARGH.)
[OTH],"(Goddamn, why-)"

[OTH],"(Well, I'm fine, guys!)"
[OTH],(Now if I can-)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny."
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],Hello?
Cartman,"Yo, Pops!"
[OTH],"Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?"
Cartman,"You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?"
[OTH],Get in here!
Cartman,Westsa-eed-eh.
[OTH],Take that wig off! What's gotten into you?!
Cartman,"You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance."
[OTH],"What?! Noh! Uh, did I?"
Cartman,He said you kissed her with your tongue.
[OTH],"Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children."
Cartman,Huho. So you're not my dad?
[OTH],"Of course not. Here. You children sit down,"
[OTH],"...and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.

When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen,
and the two take off their clothes,
that's right,
And they caress and touch each other,
until the part of the man grows,
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot,
And the man says ""I love you"" and the woman says ""hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom""
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait... ...and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says,
""Baby, I'm gettin' hot!""
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of..."
Cartman,What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
[OTH],"Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember."
[OTH],"Whoa, Chef! You're so strong!"
[OTH],"Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos!"
[OTH],Are we late for the party?
[OTH],What the hell town is this?
[OTH],"There you are, like a throbbing star. I want-"
[OTH],"Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!"
[OTH],"Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!"
[OTH],Woooh! Whooppee!! Unhh!

[OTH],There you are-
[OTH],"Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!"
[OTH],"Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a menage o'three?"
[OTH],Yeah! When two women are involved.
[OTH],"Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman."
[OTH],And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
Cartman,"No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!"
[OTH],"And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-"
[OTH],Here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.
Cartman,"Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend."
[OTH],"I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all."
Cartman,Really? You don't think so?
[OTH],"Naw, you're not fat."
Cartman,"Gee, that's kewl."
[OTH],"Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning."

Cartman,How much?

[OTH],"All right. From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef , Jimbo , Mr. Garrison , Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski , myself, my friend Kevin , or, the 1989 Denver Broncos."
[OTH],"Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!"
[OTH],The test results are in this envelope.
[OTH],Shall I... open it?
[OTH],"Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!"
[OTH],"Erhum ehrum uh The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-"
[OTH],Who is Eric Cartman's father? Is it - Chief Running Water? Or is it - Chef? Is it Mephesto? Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? Or is it Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],Nope. He's gay.
[OTH],You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
[OTH],Is it Jimbo?
[OTH],Daaagh!
[OTH],Or is Officer Barbrady?
[OTH],Huh?! Where?!
[OTH],Or could it be Ned?
[OTH],Could be.
[OTH],Or Mr. Broflovski??
[OTH],"Dad, how could you?!"
[OTH],"Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? The answer is coming on an all-new South Park, in just four weeks."
Cartman,What?! Son of a bitch!
[OTH],"Since the last South Park, you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of Eric Cartman is. Now, finally, the shocking truth about Cartman's lineage... will not be seen tonight, so that we can bring you the following special presentation."
[OTH],"Now, get ready for Canada's hottest action stars,"
[OTH],Terrance and Phillip in HBC's Movie of the Week:
[OTH],Not Without My Anus. Based on a true story.
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer."
[OTH],"That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!"
[OTH],"Oh, Terrance, You farted in court."
[OTH],"Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense."
[OTH],"All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,"
[OTH],"a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.

""Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in

with my new hammer."""
[OTH],"Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God. J'accuse, Terrance."
[OTH],"Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?"
[OTH],"Yes, please."
[OTH],That's called the monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys.
[OTH],The monkey claw is smelly.
[OTH],"Come on, get a move on. I ain't gettin' any younger up here."
[OTH],"My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian."
[OTH],That is correct.
[OTH],"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument."
[OTH],"I have, haven't I, Terrance?"
[OTH],"Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not!"
[OTH],Sustained.
[OTH],"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?"
[OTH],"Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you."
[OTH],Just kidding.
[OTH],The defense rests.
[OTH],Goddammit! That isn't funny!
[OTH],"Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get the hell outta here?"
[OTH],"We have, Your Honor. We have found Terrance, in the above entitled action of murder against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer--"
[OTH],You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we have some flatulence issues.
[OTH],"I said, we find--"
[OTH],We find Terrance--
[OTH],Not guilty!!
[OTH],"Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber."
[OTH],"That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner."
[OTH],Hear hear.
[OTH],"Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?"
[OTH],There are hard feelings! This isn't over. I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done. And do you know why?
[OTH],'Cause you're a dick?
[OTH],"No, Because I hate you. You think farting is so funny. Well, it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--"
[OTH],"Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer."
[OTH],Cancer?
[OTH],Yes. In the head.
[OTH],Head cancer?
[OTH],"This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip! You'll rue this day!"
[OTH],"Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip."
[OTH],"Yes, perhaps he's homophobic."
[OTH],"But we're not gay, Phillip."
[OTH],We're not?
[OTH],"Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner."
[OTH],"Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft Dinner can calm my nerves."
[OTH],"Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week."
[OTH],He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
[OTH],God only knows.
[OTH],"The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance."
[OTH],It sure is. Let's look for treasure.
[OTH],"Yes, let's look for treasure."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Hello, Is this Scott, from Canada?"
[OTH],"Yess, yes it is."
[OTH],"You're a Journalist, right?"
[OTH],Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
[OTH],I understand that you hate Terrance and Phillip.
[OTH],"Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!"
[OTH],"Well, what about I help you get rid of them once and for all?"
[OTH],Who is this?
[OTH],"Let's just say that I'm someone who can help you, if you help me."
[OTH],"Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein."
[OTH],Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi dictator?
[OTH],"Eey, relax guy. I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest."
[OTH],What do you want?
[OTH],"You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends in to Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started."
[OTH],I'm not sure I should trust you.
[OTH],"Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me!"
[OTH],"Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip."
[OTH],"Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob."
[OTH],"Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip."
[OTH],"My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob."
[OTH],How can you guys say stuff like that?
[OTH],"Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob."
[OTH],"I know, but--"
[OTH],"Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver."
[OTH],"I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside."
[OTH],No it isn't. Wanna see what's on the inside of me?
[OTH],"Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are."
[OTH],"Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks."
[OTH],"Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you."
[OTH],"Thanks, you guys."
[OTH],Hello Barky. Hello Purry.
[OTH],"Bark, bark."
[OTH],"Purr, purr."
[OTH],"Say Terrance, I was just aboot to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?"
[OTH],"You know I never turn down Kraft Dinner, Phillip."
[OTH],I'm going to put on a pirate costume.
[OTH],Special delivery for Terrance.
[OTH],I'll take that.
[OTH],"Sign here, and here, and here, and here, and here. And here."
[OTH],"Ooh, Terrannce! You got a letter!"
[OTH],"Shiver me timbers, Phillip. At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner. Oh my God!"
[OTH],"What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?"
[OTH],No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
[OTH],"Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally? God, why? Say, Terrance, who's Sally?"
[OTH],My daughter.
[OTH],"I never know you had a daughter, Terrance."
[OTH],"Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?"
[OTH],"No, you never did, Terrance."
[OTH],Oh. Well. It all began fifteen years ago.
[OTH],"My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion."
[OTH],"Yes, indeed. But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran. And I will have to go and find her."
[OTH],"Then I'll go with you, Terrance."
[OTH],"You're such a good friend, Phillip."
[OTH],"Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kroff Dinner."
[OTH],"Avast there, mateys."
[OTH],"Hello, Celine Dion."
[OTH],"Terrance, this is quite a surprise."
[OTH],You're looking well.
[OTH],And you.
[OTH],"Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?"
[OTH],"She's in the Middle East, studying anthropology. Why?"
[OTH],"Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return."
[OTH],"Oh, Terrance. What happened to us?"
[OTH],"We just grew apart, Celine Dion."
[OTH],"Please, bring our daughter home safe, Terrance."
[OTH],"Hello, Ugly Bob."
[OTH],"Hi, guys."
[OTH],How's the paper bag working out?
[OTH],People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
[OTH],"Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please."
[OTH],Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there!
[OTH],"Dammit man! Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!!"
[OTH],"All right, then. There's a flight leaving today."
[OTH],"Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance."
[OTH],"In-deed, Phillip."
[OTH],"Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kroff Dinner."
[OTH],"Same here, Phillip!"
[OTH],"O Ca-nada,
Our home and native land,"
[OTH],"True patriot love,
In all thy sons' command,"
[OTH],"With glowing hearts we see thee rise,"
[OTH],"The True North, strong and free"
[OTH],"From far and wide, O Canada,
We stand on guard for thee,"
[OTH],God keep our land...
[OTH],"Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon."
[OTH],"Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon."
[OTH],The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
[OTH],Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
[OTH],Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
[OTH],"Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain."
[OTH],"Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out."
[OTH],"I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers."
[OTH],I Got Ya.
[OTH],Burned your face.
[OTH],"Ow, that's rancid. Hahahahaha."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin."
[OTH],"Oh, look. There she is."
[OTH],"Oh, good."
[OTH],Goo. Where?
[OTH],"I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance."
[OTH],I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
[OTH],Pa-pa.
[OTH],"Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance."
[OTH],"Oh, now I see the resemblance!"
[OTH],"Well, enough of Iran, let's get home."
[OTH],"Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again."
[OTH],"Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend."
[OTH],"No, you're gaining a pop vocalist."
[OTH],Oh my God! What is this?!
[OTH],Is this Canada?
[OTH],It seems to have changed.
[OTH],This is madness!
[OTH],"What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?"
[OTH],"I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?"
[OTH],I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
[OTH],"Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--"
[OTH],"Terrance, ha, could you come back a little later?"
[OTH],Why?!
[OTH],"Ah, I'm just a little busy right now."
[OTH],"You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?"
[OTH],"Well, I..."
[OTH],Hi guys.
[OTH],"Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!"
[OTH],What the hell are you doing here?!
[OTH],I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
[OTH],"Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!"
[OTH],"What do you mean? Why are you calling him ""Ugly Bob""?"
[OTH],"Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!"
[OTH],"You told me your name ""Handsome Bob""!"
[OTH],"Look at him, Celine Dion."
[OTH],Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhhhh!!!
[OTH],Behold his horrible face.
[OTH],"Oh my God, he's hideously ugly! And I am pregnant with his child!"
[OTH],What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!
[OTH],I'm going to have a freak baby!!
[OTH],"Ohh, the humanity!!"
[OTH],"Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?"
[OTH],"Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest."
[OTH],...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot.
[OTH],"Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran."
[OTH],I thought you were from Iraq.
[OTH],"Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!"
[OTH],"Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada."
[OTH],Yes. I agree whole-fartedly.
[OTH],"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?"
[OTH],"Oh, hello, Scott."
[OTH],"You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--"
[OTH],"Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?"
[OTH],"Wait, what were you saying?"
[OTH],"Nothing, why?"
[OTH],"Hey, Scott. Guess what?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both!"
[OTH],"What are you doing, Scott?"
[OTH],I'm wishing cancer upon you.
[OTH],Cancer?!
[OTH],That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
[OTH],"Ooh, stop that!"
[OTH],"Hey, don't give me cancer!"
[OTH],"Mr. Hussein, the U.S. Government is becoming worried."
[OTH],"Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax."
[OTH],You seem to be... taking over Canada.
[OTH],"Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs."
[OTH],We didn't say anything about bombs.
[OTH],"Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax."
[OTH],"We're giving you just three years to clear your forces out of Canada, and after that, we're gonna bomb all of Iran."
[OTH],I'm from Iraq.
[OTH],"Iran, Iraq, what's the difference?"
[OTH],"Euugh. I hate Americans. Please, let me kill them!"
[OTH],"No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world!"
[OTH],What's so funny!
[OTH],"Nothing! Relax, brother."
[OTH],"Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!"
[OTH],"Oh, really?"
[OTH],You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
[OTH],I changed my mind. Pray that I don't change it any further.
[OTH],This deal's getting worse all the time.
[OTH],"Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television."
[OTH],Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
[OTH],Oh look. Here's a show.
[OTH],...well fuck you.
[OTH],Arrrggghh!
[OTH],And this is what life would be like...
[OTH],It's so stupid!
[OTH],"Goddamn, their TV shows are lame!"
[OTH],"The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is--"
[OTH],Look at their silly American heads.
[OTH],They look like groundhogs.
Cartman,He's my father?!
[OTH],"And in other news it appears that Saddam Hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the U.S. inspect his military operations. When asked if he would uphold his side of the agreement, Hussein replied, quote: ""Hey, relax, fella. You need a rest, guy."""
[OTH],"Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?"
[OTH],"Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator."
[OTH],"Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kroff Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks!"
[OTH],"That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance."
[OTH],"It sure did, Phillip."
[OTH],"Oh, wait. That is the phone."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Terrance, this is Scott."
[OTH],"Oh. Hey, it's Scott."
[OTH],Tell him he's a smelly bastard.
[OTH],"Phillip says hello, Scott."
[OTH],"Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer."
[OTH],"You are such a dick, Scott."
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada. You give other Canadians a bad name. And if I had my hair-
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"How do you like that, Scott?!"
[OTH],You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
[OTH],"Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'"
[OTH],Goddammit!
[OTH],"Oh, wait a second, Scott."
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour."
[OTH],"Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly."
[OTH],Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
[OTH],We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.
[OTH],What's this?!
[OTH],"He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion."
[OTH],"Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch."
[OTH],Eh! Who are you?
[OTH],"I'm Bob. But my friends call me ""Ugly Bob"", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim."
[OTH],Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.
[OTH],"Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours."
[OTH],You can?
[OTH],Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
[OTH],What? Why?
[OTH],"Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it. Look over here. All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?"
[OTH],"Did you say, ""hostile takeover of Canada""?"
[OTH],"No, no, relax there, fella!"
[OTH],"Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up."
[OTH],"Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?"
[OTH],Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure.
[OTH],What are you idiots doing?
[OTH],We're looking for treasure!
[OTH],Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
[OTH],"No, we're searching for treasure."
[OTH],Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictator who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
[OTH],Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
[OTH],"Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?"
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter!
[OTH],"You mean, we are to blame?!"
[OTH],"That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this."
[OTH],What is this?
[OTH],"It's a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions."
[OTH],That plan's scary!
[OTH],"Well, you must do it for Canada."
[OTH],"For Canada, Terrance."
[OTH],"For Canada, Phillip."
[OTH],"Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor."
[OTH],"Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada."
[OTH],Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.
[OTH],That's funny!
[OTH],Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
[OTH],Why is that?
[OTH],"That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?"
[OTH],"Yes. Apparently, he does."
[OTH],Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea."
[OTH],"I do, Terrance."
[OTH],"And the Roughriders are giving the Roughriders a run for their money! All else aside, I must say that the Roughriders are simply outmatched by these Roughriders And that's going to take us to halftime. Be sure to stick around for the halftime show: Saddam and the Electric Iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers!"
[OTH],"Well, I guess it's time, old friend."
[OTH],Yes. Prepare the alert!
[OTH],Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.
[OTH],"You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as ""New Baghdad!"" Qoloh Qalah!"
[OTH],You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!
[OTH],And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem...
[OTH],Or you will be stabbed in the head!
[OTH],Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht...
[OTH],"Now, Phlllip?"
[OTH],"Now, Terrance."
[OTH],Hey!! What the hell is this?
[OTH],Freh kashu kaliakaliakatchut...
[OTH],They're using chemical warfare! How could they?!
[OTH],"We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!"
[OTH],"Oh, Glorious Day!"
[OTH],"Phillip, Terrance! You've saved Canada!"
[OTH],"Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea."
[OTH],"God bless you, Phillip."
[OTH],"Don't touch me, Ugly Bob!"
[OTH],"Hey, What the hell happened? You were supposed to be blown up!"
[OTH],"We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada."
[OTH],Oh! That is so juvenile!
[OTH],"Hey, Scott, you like apples?"
[OTH],Of course!
[OTH],How do you like them apples?
[OTH],"I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!!"
[OTH],Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
[OTH],"You're right, Terrance. You're right."
[OTH],"O Canada, our home and native land,"
[OTH],True patriot love in all thy sons command
[OTH],"With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
the True North, strong and free,"
[OTH],"From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee
God keep our land glorious and free
Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee"
[OTH],"Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee"
[OTH],"Who is Eric Cartman's father? Find out on an all new South Park, in just a few weeks."
[OTH],"Since the last South Park, you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of Eric Cartman is. Now, finally, the shocking truth about Cartman's lineage... will not be seen tonight, so that we can bring you the following special presentation."
[OTH],"Now, get ready for Canada's hottest action stars,"
[OTH],Terrance and Phillip in HBC's Movie of the Week:
[OTH],Not Without My Anus. Based on a true story.
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer."
[OTH],"That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!"
[OTH],"Oh, Terrance, You farted in court."
[OTH],"Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense."
[OTH],"All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,"
[OTH],"a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.

""Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in

with my new hammer."""
[OTH],"Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God. J'accuse, Terrance."
[OTH],"Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?"
[OTH],"Yes, please."
[OTH],That's called the monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys.
[OTH],The monkey claw is smelly.
[OTH],"Come on, get a move on. I ain't gettin' any younger up here."
[OTH],"My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian."
[OTH],That is correct.
[OTH],"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument."
[OTH],"I have, haven't I, Terrance?"
[OTH],"Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not!"
[OTH],Sustained.
[OTH],"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?"
[OTH],"Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you."
[OTH],Just kidding.
[OTH],The defense rests.
[OTH],Goddammit! That isn't funny!
[OTH],"Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get the hell outta here?"
[OTH],"We have, Your Honor. We have found Terrance, in the above entitled action of murder against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer--"
[OTH],You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we have some flatulence issues.
[OTH],"I said, we find--"
[OTH],We find Terrance--
[OTH],Not guilty!!
[OTH],"Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber."
[OTH],"That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner."
[OTH],Hear hear.
[OTH],"Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?"
[OTH],There are hard feelings! This isn't over. I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done. And do you know why?
[OTH],'Cause you're a dick?
[OTH],"No, Because I hate you. You think farting is so funny. Well, it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--"
[OTH],"Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer."
[OTH],Cancer?
[OTH],Yes. In the head.
[OTH],Head cancer?
[OTH],"This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip! You'll rue this day!"
[OTH],"Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip."
[OTH],"Yes, perhaps he's homophobic."
[OTH],"But we're not gay, Phillip."
[OTH],We're not?
[OTH],"Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner."
[OTH],"Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft Dinner can calm my nerves."
[OTH],"Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week."
[OTH],He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
[OTH],God only knows.
[OTH],"The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance."
[OTH],It sure is. Let's look for treasure.
[OTH],"Yes, let's look for treasure."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Hello, Is this Scott, from Canada?"
[OTH],"Yess, yes it is."
[OTH],"You're a Journalist, right?"
[OTH],Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
[OTH],I understand that you hate Terrance and Phillip.
[OTH],"Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!"
[OTH],"Well, what about I help you get rid of them once and for all?"
[OTH],Who is this?
[OTH],"Let's just say that I'm someone who can help you, if you help me."
[OTH],"Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein."
[OTH],Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi dictator?
[OTH],"Eey, relax guy. I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest."
[OTH],What do you want?
[OTH],"You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends in to Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started."
[OTH],I'm not sure I should trust you.
[OTH],"Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me!"
[OTH],"Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip."
[OTH],"Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob."
[OTH],"Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip."
[OTH],"My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob."
[OTH],How can you guys say stuff like that?
[OTH],"Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob."
[OTH],"I know, but--"
[OTH],"Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver."
[OTH],"I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside."
[OTH],No it isn't. Wanna see what's on the inside of me?
[OTH],"Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are."
[OTH],"Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks."
[OTH],"Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you."
[OTH],"Thanks, you guys."
[OTH],Hello Barky. Hello Purry.
[OTH],"Bark, bark."
[OTH],"Purr, purr."
[OTH],"Say Terrance, I was just aboot to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?"
[OTH],"You know I never turn down Kraft Dinner, Phillip."
[OTH],I'm going to put on a pirate costume.
[OTH],Special delivery for Terrance.
[OTH],I'll take that.
[OTH],"Sign here, and here, and here, and here, and here. And here."
[OTH],"Ooh, Terrannce! You got a letter!"
[OTH],"Shiver me timbers, Phillip. At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner. Oh my God!"
[OTH],"What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?"
[OTH],No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
[OTH],"Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally? God, why? Say, Terrance, who's Sally?"
[OTH],My daughter.
[OTH],"I never know you had a daughter, Terrance."
[OTH],"Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?"
[OTH],"No, you never did, Terrance."
[OTH],Oh. Well. It all began fifteen years ago.
[OTH],"My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion."
[OTH],"Yes, indeed. But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran. And I will have to go and find her."
[OTH],"Then I'll go with you, Terrance."
[OTH],"You're such a good friend, Phillip."
[OTH],"Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kroff Dinner."
[OTH],"Avast there, mateys."
[OTH],"Hello, Celine Dion."
[OTH],"Terrance, this is quite a surprise."
[OTH],You're looking well.
[OTH],And you.
[OTH],"Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?"
[OTH],"She's in the Middle East, studying anthropology. Why?"
[OTH],"Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return."
[OTH],"Oh, Terrance. What happened to us?"
[OTH],"We just grew apart, Celine Dion."
[OTH],"Please, bring our daughter home safe, Terrance."
[OTH],"Hello, Ugly Bob."
[OTH],"Hi, guys."
[OTH],How's the paper bag working out?
[OTH],People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
[OTH],"Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please."
[OTH],Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there!
[OTH],"Dammit man! Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!!"
[OTH],"All right, then. There's a flight leaving today."
[OTH],"Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance."
[OTH],"In-deed, Phillip."
[OTH],"Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kroff Dinner."
[OTH],"Same here, Phillip!"
[OTH],"O Ca-nada,
Our home and native land,"
[OTH],"True patriot love,
In all thy sons' command,"
[OTH],"With glowing hearts we see thee rise,"
[OTH],"The True North, strong and free"
[OTH],"From far and wide, O Canada,
We stand on guard for thee,"
[OTH],God keep our land...
[OTH],"Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon."
[OTH],"Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon."
[OTH],The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
[OTH],Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
[OTH],Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
[OTH],"Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain."
[OTH],"Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out."
[OTH],"I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers."
[OTH],I Got Ya.
[OTH],Burned your face.
[OTH],"Ow, that's rancid. Hahahahaha."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin."
[OTH],"Oh, look. There she is."
[OTH],"Oh, good."
[OTH],Goo. Where?
[OTH],"I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance."
[OTH],I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
[OTH],Pa-pa.
[OTH],"Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance."
[OTH],"Oh, now I see the resemblance!"
[OTH],"Well, enough of Iran, let's get home."
[OTH],"Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again."
[OTH],"Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend."
[OTH],"No, you're gaining a pop vocalist."
[OTH],Oh my God! What is this?!
[OTH],Is this Canada?
[OTH],It seems to have changed.
[OTH],This is madness!
[OTH],"What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?"
[OTH],"I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?"
[OTH],I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
[OTH],"Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--"
[OTH],"Terrance, ha, could you come back a little later?"
[OTH],Why?!
[OTH],"Ah, I'm just a little busy right now."
[OTH],"You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?"
[OTH],"Well, I..."
[OTH],Hi guys.
[OTH],"Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!"
[OTH],What the hell are you doing here?!
[OTH],I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
[OTH],"Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!"
[OTH],"What do you mean? Why are you calling him ""Ugly Bob""?"
[OTH],"Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!"
[OTH],"You told me your name ""Handsome Bob""!"
[OTH],"Look at him, Celine Dion."
[OTH],Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhhhh!!!
[OTH],Behold his horrible face.
[OTH],"Oh my God, he's hideously ugly! And I am pregnant with his child!"
[OTH],What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!
[OTH],I'm going to have a freak baby!!
[OTH],"Ohh, the humanity!!"
[OTH],"Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?"
[OTH],"Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest."
[OTH],...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot.
[OTH],"Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran."
[OTH],I thought you were from Iraq.
[OTH],"Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!"
[OTH],"Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada."
[OTH],Yes. I agree whole-fartedly.
[OTH],"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?"
[OTH],"Oh, hello, Scott."
[OTH],"You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--"
[OTH],"Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?"
[OTH],"Wait, what were you saying?"
[OTH],"Nothing, why?"
[OTH],"Hey, Scott. Guess what?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both!"
[OTH],"What are you doing, Scott?"
[OTH],I'm wishing cancer upon you.
[OTH],Cancer?!
[OTH],That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
[OTH],"Ooh, stop that!"
[OTH],"Hey, don't give me cancer!"
[OTH],"Mr. Hussein, the U.S. Government is becoming worried."
[OTH],"Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax."
[OTH],You seem to be... taking over Canada.
[OTH],"Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs."
[OTH],We didn't say anything about bombs.
[OTH],"Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax."
[OTH],"We're giving you just three years to clear your forces out of Canada, and after that, we're gonna bomb all of Iran."
[OTH],I'm from Iraq.
[OTH],"Iran, Iraq, what's the difference?"
[OTH],"Euugh. I hate Americans. Please, let me kill them!"
[OTH],"No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world!"
[OTH],What's so funny!
[OTH],"Nothing! Relax, brother."
[OTH],"Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!"
[OTH],"Oh, really?"
[OTH],You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
[OTH],I changed my mind. Pray that I don't change it any further.
[OTH],This deal's getting worse all the time.
[OTH],"Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television."
[OTH],Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
[OTH],Oh look. Here's a show.
[OTH],...well fuck you.
[OTH],Arrrggghh!
[OTH],And this is what life would be like...
[OTH],It's so stupid!
[OTH],"Goddamn, their TV shows are lame!"
[OTH],"The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is--"
[OTH],Look at their silly American heads.
[OTH],They look like groundhogs.
Cartman,He's my father?!
[OTH],"And in other news it appears that Saddam Hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the U.S. inspect his military operations. When asked if he would uphold his side of the agreement, Hussein replied, quote: ""Hey, relax, fella. You need a rest, guy."""
[OTH],"Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?"
[OTH],"Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator."
[OTH],"Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kroff Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks!"
[OTH],"That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance."
[OTH],"It sure did, Phillip."
[OTH],"Oh, wait. That is the phone."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Terrance, this is Scott."
[OTH],"Oh. Hey, it's Scott."
[OTH],Tell him he's a smelly bastard.
[OTH],"Phillip says hello, Scott."
[OTH],"Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer."
[OTH],"You are such a dick, Scott."
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],You're a dick.
[OTH],The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada. You give other Canadians a bad name. And if I had my hair-
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"How do you like that, Scott?!"
[OTH],You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
[OTH],"Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'"
[OTH],Goddammit!
[OTH],"Oh, wait a second, Scott."
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour."
[OTH],"Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly."
[OTH],Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
[OTH],We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.
[OTH],What's this?!
[OTH],"He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion."
[OTH],"Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch."
[OTH],Eh! Who are you?
[OTH],"I'm Bob. But my friends call me ""Ugly Bob"", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim."
[OTH],Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.
[OTH],"Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours."
[OTH],You can?
[OTH],Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
[OTH],What? Why?
[OTH],"Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it. Look over here. All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?"
[OTH],"Did you say, ""hostile takeover of Canada""?"
[OTH],"No, no, relax there, fella!"
[OTH],"Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up."
[OTH],"Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?"
[OTH],Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure.
[OTH],What are you idiots doing?
[OTH],We're looking for treasure!
[OTH],Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
[OTH],"No, we're searching for treasure."
[OTH],Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictator who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
[OTH],Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
[OTH],"Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?"
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter!
[OTH],"You mean, we are to blame?!"
[OTH],"That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this."
[OTH],What is this?
[OTH],"It's a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions."
[OTH],That plan's scary!
[OTH],"Well, you must do it for Canada."
[OTH],"For Canada, Terrance."
[OTH],"For Canada, Phillip."
[OTH],"Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor."
[OTH],"Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada."
[OTH],Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.
[OTH],That's funny!
[OTH],Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
[OTH],Why is that?
[OTH],"That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?"
[OTH],"Yes. Apparently, he does."
[OTH],Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea."
[OTH],"I do, Terrance."
[OTH],"And the Roughriders are giving the Roughriders a run for their money! All else aside, I must say that the Roughriders are simply outmatched by these Roughriders And that's going to take us to halftime. Be sure to stick around for the halftime show: Saddam and the Electric Iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers!"
[OTH],"Well, I guess it's time, old friend."
[OTH],Yes. Prepare the alert!
[OTH],Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.
[OTH],"You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as ""New Baghdad!"" Qoloh Qalah!"
[OTH],You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!
[OTH],And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem...
[OTH],Or you will be stabbed in the head!
[OTH],Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht...
[OTH],"Now, Phlllip?"
[OTH],"Now, Terrance."
[OTH],Hey!! What the hell is this?
[OTH],Freh kashu kaliakaliakatchut...
[OTH],They're using chemical warfare! How could they?!
[OTH],"We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!"
[OTH],"Oh, Glorious Day!"
[OTH],"Phillip, Terrance! You've saved Canada!"
[OTH],"Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea."
[OTH],"God bless you, Phillip."
[OTH],"Don't touch me, Ugly Bob!"
[OTH],"Hey, What the hell happened? You were supposed to be blown up!"
[OTH],"We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada."
[OTH],Oh! That is so juvenile!
[OTH],"Hey, Scott, you like apples?"
[OTH],Of course!
[OTH],How do you like them apples?
[OTH],"I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!!"
[OTH],Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
[OTH],"You're right, Terrance. You're right."
[OTH],"O Canada, our home and native land,"
[OTH],True patriot love in all thy sons command
[OTH],"With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
the True North, strong and free,"
[OTH],"From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee
God keep our land glorious and free
Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee"
[OTH],"Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee"
[OTH],"Who is Eric Cartman's father? Find out on an all new South Park, in just a few weeks."
[OTH],"Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy."
[OTH],"Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you will know the answer."
[OTH],"And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room."
Cartman,"Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life."
[OTH],"Oooh- hey, Kenny."
[OTH],"Gentlemen, the father is..."
[OTH],"Hey, what the hell's going on?"
[OTH],It's a power outage!
[OTH],Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
[OTH],"Oh my God, look!"
[OTH],"(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],Mephesto's been shot.
[OTH],Is he ...dead?
[OTH],"Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!"
[OTH],Then who was it?
[OTH],Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
Cartman,Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
[OTH],Or was it Sheila Broflovski?
[OTH],Waait! He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
Cartman,Goddammit! Who's my father?
[OTH],We've got to get him to the hospital.
Cartman,You've got to be kidding me!
[OTH],"Come on, children!"
Cartman,Eeeehh..!
[OTH],"Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this."
[OTH],There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
[OTH],Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
[OTH],Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
Cartman,Is he awake yet?
[OTH],He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
[OTH],Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
[OTH],What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
[OTH],I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to... Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
[OTH],Could you pull over so I can get out?
[OTH],What? We have to get to the hospital.
[OTH],I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
[OTH],"Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?"
[OTH],"Man, it's really starting to snow."
[OTH],I hope they don't close the roads.
Cartman,They can't. Mephesto can't die.
[OTH],"Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman."
Cartman,"No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, ""Come Sail Away"", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it."
[OTH],Really?
Cartman,"Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done."
[OTH],I'm sailing away...
Cartman,No! Don't!
[OTH],Set an open course for the virgin sea...
Cartman,Eh--
Cartman,"For I've got to be free,
Free to face the life that's ahead of me,
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard,
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore,
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on,
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay,
A gathering of angels appeared above my head,
They sang to us this song of hope,
And this is what they said,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me"
Cartman,"I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!"
[OTH],We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
[OTH],Uh... Where are our children?
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?"
[OTH],"Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking."
[OTH],Mayor! Mayor!
[OTH],The press is here.
[OTH],My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
[OTH],Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.
[OTH],We're desperate for stories.
[OTH],A-and this one is so compelling.
[OTH],Really??
[OTH],Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
[OTH],"Hey, I thought of something. Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction."
[OTH],"Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?"
[OTH],"Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--"
[OTH],Shh.
[OTH],"We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins."
[OTH],Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family."
[OTH],It is?
[OTH],"Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay!"
[OTH],Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
[OTH],Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?
[OTH],I want to have... an abortion.
[OTH],"Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs..."
[OTH],"Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world."
[OTH],"Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?"
[OTH],About eight years ago.
[OTH],"...I sseee, so the fetus is..."
[OTH],Eight years old.
[OTH],"Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yes, this is what we would refer to as the ""fortieth trimester""."
[OTH],But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
[OTH],"Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester."
[OTH],"Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body."
[OTH],"Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman."
[OTH],"Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day!"
[OTH],"Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor!"
[OTH],"Ugh. I can't do it, dude."
[OTH],"Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad."
Cartman,"Yeah, stop being a wuss!"
[OTH],Doctor!
[OTH],"One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!"
[OTH],"We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son."
[OTH],Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
[OTH],"I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle."
[OTH],Oh man. I'm gonna be sick.
[OTH],"There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of."
[OTH],Oogh.
[OTH],"Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone."
[OTH],Ooooogh.
[OTH],Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.
[OTH],"Oops, he's hemorrhaging."
[OTH],Aghh!
[OTH],Ooo! His head fell off.
[OTH],I'm gotta get outta here!
[OTH],Stan!
[OTH],"Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach."
[OTH],"And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot!"
[OTH],"Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you. I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Mister-uhh Garrison."
[OTH],Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!
[OTH],"Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],"Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!"
[OTH],"I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],Thank you! Next!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Next!
[OTH],"I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs!
[OTH],"...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed."
[OTH],"Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th."
[OTH],But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
[OTH],"No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff."
[OTH],"Oh, dear."
[OTH],"Well, this is about all I can do for him."
Cartman,Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
[OTH],"Sorry, son, it might be a while."
Cartman,"Wake up, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition."
Cartman,I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],I'm sailing ay...
Cartman,"--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard..."
[OTH],"Okay okay, let's get outta here now!"
Cartman,...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...
[OTH],I don't know if that's gonna be too easy.
Cartman,"...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on..."
[OTH],"My God, that's a hell of a storm."
Cartman,"I look to the sea; Reflections--
--in the waves spark my memory..."
[OTH],"Oh, weak."
Cartman,"...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--"
[OTH],"God, I hate mountains. This better not push back our shooting schedule."
[OTH],"Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it."
[OTH],Who's that?
[OTH],"Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to get him to play the part of the little monkey guy."
[OTH],"Whoa. Talk about ""all washed-up"", huh? Great to have you, Eric!"
[OTH],"Here we go, aaand action."
[OTH],I want to announce who the father is.
[OTH],Bang!!
[OTH],"Oh, I've been shot!"
[OTH],Nobody move! I'm a law officer!
[OTH],"My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!"
[OTH],Whoaw..!
[OTH],"You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef."
[OTH],"Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!"
[OTH],"Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job."
[OTH],"Whoa, this is a good movie!"
Cartman,"Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee"
[OTH],"Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?"
[OTH],"Doctor, I can't focus!"
[OTH],"We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly."
[OTH],Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
[OTH],"Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked."
[OTH],"Metaphorically speaking, that is."
Cartman,What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
[OTH],He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.
[OTH],"Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?"
[OTH],"Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your host, John Walsh."
[OTH],"Good evening and welcome to America's Most Wanted. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto was gunned down in his laboratory. America's Most Wanted has reconstructed this heinous crime in hopes that your calls could help solve the case."
[OTH],I've been shot!
[OTH],"My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help!"
[OTH],"Right away, Mr. Garrison."
Cartman,"No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?"
[OTH],What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
[OTH],I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?
Cartman,This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--
[OTH],God-dammit!
[OTH],What the hell is this?!
[OTH],We've lost the feed to L.A.
[OTH],"Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit."
[OTH],Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?
[OTH],Somebody go see why we lost the hookup!
[OTH],"Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!"
[OTH],"Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine."
[OTH],"Nurse, I could use some help in here!"
[OTH],Coming!
Cartman,Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
[OTH],"Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short."
[OTH],"Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!"
[OTH],"Oh, sorry."
[OTH],"Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one."
[OTH],"Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm."
[OTH],"I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know..."
[OTH],"Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly."
[OTH],What do you want me to do?
[OTH],Do you know anything about surgery?
[OTH],I used to watch Quincy.
[OTH],"What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives."
[OTH],"No way, dude!"
[OTH],"Well, we're not going anywhere for a loong time."
[OTH],We're snowed in?
[OTH],Yes. We're trapped!
[OTH],Like sailors on a submarine.
[OTH],"My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen."
[OTH],"Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast."
[OTH],"Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too."
[OTH],I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.
[OTH],Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive.
[OTH],"Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?"
[OTH],"That's the law of land, Mr. Director. It ain't pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it."
[OTH],"Buut, how do we decide ""who""?"
[OTH],"Well, we draw straws."
[OTH],"Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?"
[OTH],"Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws."
[OTH],Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
[OTH],Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--
[OTH],"Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me. Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms. Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart."
[OTH],Oh boy.
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],Suction!
Cartman,"Hey, who's screwing with the lights?"
[OTH],Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
Cartman,That is really starting to piss me off.
[OTH],"Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing. Whew."
[OTH],Whew.
[OTH],Wooo!
[OTH],Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
[OTH],The short what?
[OTH],"Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!"
[OTH],That's not how I played it!
[OTH],"Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling."
[OTH],"I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital."
[OTH],So how do we get to it?
[OTH],"We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny."
[OTH],"Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct."
[OTH],"Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here."
[OTH],"Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?"
Cartman,"Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me."
[OTH],"Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!"
[OTH],(Huh?)
[OTH],I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...
[OTH],We're all going to die in this horrible place.
[OTH],We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
[OTH],How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
[OTH],There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts.
[OTH],"Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts."
[OTH],Eat Eric Roberts!
Cartman,"No! No, please!"
[OTH],"Well, there's no going back now. We're cannibals. God save us."
[OTH],"God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!"
[OTH],"Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected."
[OTH],Aaww.
[OTH],"This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it."
[OTH],"What time is it, Barbrady?"
[OTH],It's almost midnight.
[OTH],Oh! I can't... go on.
[OTH],"We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again."
[OTH],"What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?"
[OTH],"Team B? Come in, Team B."
[OTH],(This is Team B.)
[OTH],"Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage."
[OTH],(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
[OTH],"Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left."
[OTH],(Yup! I see it in the drift.)
[OTH],Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
Cartman,"What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?"
[OTH],"My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive."
[OTH],"It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who."
[OTH],Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?
[OTH],"(Okay, I've reached the generator)"
[OTH],"Roger, Team B. He's reached the backup generator. Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?"
[OTH],(Roger.)
[OTH],"Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?"
[OTH],(Negative.)
[OTH],"Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed."
[OTH],D'you have any wire here?
[OTH],There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
[OTH],(I'll stick 'em together)
[OTH],"No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands."
[OTH],"No, he'll die!"
Cartman,"Go, Kenny!"
[OTH],Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
[OTH],(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],The power!
[OTH],Quickly! Get the scanner running again!
[OTH],We've got a chance now!
[OTH],"Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you."
[OTH],"Oh, thank you, thank you."
[OTH],We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately.
[OTH],Terminated?
[OTH],"Why yes, that's what an abortion is."
[OTH],Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
[OTH],Adoption?
[OTH],"Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption."
[OTH],"Well, that's- pretty different."
[OTH],"Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President."
[OTH],"Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine."
[OTH],Where... where am I?
[OTH],"You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--"
[OTH],Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
[OTH],Ooohhh.
[OTH],Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
[OTH],He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
[OTH],"He was a good friend, and I'll miss him."
[OTH],He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
Cartman,Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.
[OTH],"Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?"
[OTH],I don't know. Let's find out.
[OTH],Ohh. It's over! We're free!
[OTH],"Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?"
[OTH],"Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there."
[OTH],But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
[OTH],"Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time."
[OTH],Ave Maria...
[OTH],"Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?"
[OTH],"I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--"
Cartman,Just tell us already!
[OTH],"Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--"
Cartman,Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
[OTH],"Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman."
[OTH],What???
[OTH],"Yes, it's true."
[OTH],"Noo, that doesn't make sense!"
[OTH],"Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite."
[OTH],Uh-meaning what?
[OTH],Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
[OTH],It's true.
[OTH],"You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!"
[OTH],"No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis."
[OTH],"The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance."
Cartman,"Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak."
[OTH],"Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry I never told you, Eric."
[OTH],"I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you."
Cartman,"Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!"
[OTH],"Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing."
Cartman,"No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!"
[OTH],Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
Cartman,"Ooohhh, forget it!"
[OTH],"Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy."
[OTH],"Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you will know the answer."
[OTH],"And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room."
Cartman,"Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life."
[OTH],"Oooh- hey, Kenny."
[OTH],"Gentlemen, the father is..."
[OTH],"Hey, what the hell's going on?"
[OTH],It's a power outage!
[OTH],Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
[OTH],"Oh my God, look!"
[OTH],"(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],Mephesto's been shot.
[OTH],Is he ...dead?
[OTH],"Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!"
[OTH],Then who was it?
[OTH],Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
Cartman,Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
[OTH],Or was it Sheila Broflovski?
[OTH],Waait! He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
Cartman,Goddammit! Who's my father?
[OTH],We've got to get him to the hospital.
Cartman,You've got to be kidding me!
[OTH],"Come on, children!"
Cartman,Eeeehh..!
[OTH],"Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this."
[OTH],There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
[OTH],Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
[OTH],Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
Cartman,Is he awake yet?
[OTH],He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
[OTH],Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
[OTH],What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
[OTH],I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to... Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
[OTH],Could you pull over so I can get out?
[OTH],What? We have to get to the hospital.
[OTH],I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
[OTH],"Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?"
[OTH],"Man, it's really starting to snow."
[OTH],I hope they don't close the roads.
Cartman,They can't. Mephesto can't die.
[OTH],"Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman."
Cartman,"No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, ""Come Sail Away"", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it."
[OTH],Really?
Cartman,"Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done."
[OTH],I'm sailing away...
Cartman,No! Don't!
[OTH],Set an open course for the virgin sea...
Cartman,Eh--
Cartman,"For I've got to be free,
Free to face the life that's ahead of me,
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard,
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore,
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on,
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay,
A gathering of angels appeared above my head,
They sang to us this song of hope,
And this is what they said,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me"
Cartman,"I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!"
[OTH],We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
[OTH],Uh... Where are our children?
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?"
[OTH],"Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking."
[OTH],Mayor! Mayor!
[OTH],The press is here.
[OTH],My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
[OTH],Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.
[OTH],We're desperate for stories.
[OTH],A-and this one is so compelling.
[OTH],Really??
[OTH],Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
[OTH],"Hey, I thought of something. Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction."
[OTH],"Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?"
[OTH],"Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--"
[OTH],Shh.
[OTH],"We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins."
[OTH],Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family."
[OTH],It is?
[OTH],"Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay!"
[OTH],Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
[OTH],Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?
[OTH],I want to have... an abortion.
[OTH],"Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs..."
[OTH],"Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world."
[OTH],"Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?"
[OTH],About eight years ago.
[OTH],"...I sseee, so the fetus is..."
[OTH],Eight years old.
[OTH],"Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yes, this is what we would refer to as the ""fortieth trimester""."
[OTH],But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
[OTH],"Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester."
[OTH],"Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body."
[OTH],"Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman."
[OTH],"Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day!"
[OTH],"Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor!"
[OTH],"Ugh. I can't do it, dude."
[OTH],"Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad."
Cartman,"Yeah, stop being a wuss!"
[OTH],Doctor!
[OTH],"One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!"
[OTH],"We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son."
[OTH],Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
[OTH],"I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle."
[OTH],Oh man. I'm gonna be sick.
[OTH],"There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of."
[OTH],Oogh.
[OTH],"Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone."
[OTH],Ooooogh.
[OTH],Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.
[OTH],"Oops, he's hemorrhaging."
[OTH],Aghh!
[OTH],Ooo! His head fell off.
[OTH],I'm gotta get outta here!
[OTH],Stan!
[OTH],"Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach."
[OTH],"And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot!"
[OTH],"Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you. I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Mister-uhh Garrison."
[OTH],Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!
[OTH],"Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],"Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!"
[OTH],"I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],Thank you! Next!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Next!
[OTH],"I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs!
[OTH],"...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed."
[OTH],"Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th."
[OTH],But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
[OTH],"No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff."
[OTH],"Oh, dear."
[OTH],"Well, this is about all I can do for him."
Cartman,Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
[OTH],"Sorry, son, it might be a while."
Cartman,"Wake up, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition."
Cartman,I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],I'm sailing ay...
Cartman,"--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard..."
[OTH],"Okay okay, let's get outta here now!"
Cartman,...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...
[OTH],I don't know if that's gonna be too easy.
Cartman,"...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on..."
[OTH],"My God, that's a hell of a storm."
Cartman,"I look to the sea; Reflections--
--in the waves spark my memory..."
[OTH],"Oh, weak."
Cartman,"...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--"
[OTH],"God, I hate mountains. This better not push back our shooting schedule."
[OTH],"Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it."
[OTH],Who's that?
[OTH],"Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to get him to play the part of the little monkey guy."
[OTH],"Whoa. Talk about ""all washed-up"", huh? Great to have you, Eric!"
[OTH],"Here we go, aaand action."
[OTH],I want to announce who the father is.
[OTH],Bang!!
[OTH],"Oh, I've been shot!"
[OTH],Nobody move! I'm a law officer!
[OTH],"My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!"
[OTH],Whoaw..!
[OTH],"You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef."
[OTH],"Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!"
[OTH],"Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job."
[OTH],"Whoa, this is a good movie!"
Cartman,"Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee"
[OTH],"Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?"
[OTH],"Doctor, I can't focus!"
[OTH],"We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly."
[OTH],Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
[OTH],"Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked."
[OTH],"Metaphorically speaking, that is."
Cartman,What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
[OTH],He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.
[OTH],"Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?"
[OTH],"Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your host, John Walsh."
[OTH],"Good evening and welcome to America's Most Wanted. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto was gunned down in his laboratory. America's Most Wanted has reconstructed this heinous crime in hopes that your calls could help solve the case."
[OTH],I've been shot!
[OTH],"My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help!"
[OTH],"Right away, Mr. Garrison."
Cartman,"No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?"
[OTH],What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
[OTH],I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?
Cartman,This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--
[OTH],God-dammit!
[OTH],What the hell is this?!
[OTH],We've lost the feed to L.A.
[OTH],"Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit."
[OTH],Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?
[OTH],Somebody go see why we lost the hookup!
[OTH],"Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!"
[OTH],"Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine."
[OTH],"Nurse, I could use some help in here!"
[OTH],Coming!
Cartman,Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
[OTH],"Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short."
[OTH],"Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!"
[OTH],"Oh, sorry."
[OTH],"Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one."
[OTH],"Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm."
[OTH],"I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know..."
[OTH],"Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly."
[OTH],What do you want me to do?
[OTH],Do you know anything about surgery?
[OTH],I used to watch Quincy.
[OTH],"What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives."
[OTH],"No way, dude!"
[OTH],"Well, we're not going anywhere for a loong time."
[OTH],We're snowed in?
[OTH],Yes. We're trapped!
[OTH],Like sailors on a submarine.
[OTH],"My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen."
[OTH],"Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast."
[OTH],"Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too."
[OTH],I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.
[OTH],Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive.
[OTH],"Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?"
[OTH],"That's the law of land, Mr. Director. It ain't pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it."
[OTH],"Buut, how do we decide ""who""?"
[OTH],"Well, we draw straws."
[OTH],"Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?"
[OTH],"Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws."
[OTH],Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
[OTH],Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--
[OTH],"Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me. Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms. Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart."
[OTH],Oh boy.
[OTH],Bleech!
[OTH],Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],Suction!
Cartman,"Hey, who's screwing with the lights?"
[OTH],Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
Cartman,That is really starting to piss me off.
[OTH],"Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing. Whew."
[OTH],Whew.
[OTH],Wooo!
[OTH],Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
[OTH],The short what?
[OTH],"Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!"
[OTH],That's not how I played it!
[OTH],"Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling."
[OTH],"I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital."
[OTH],So how do we get to it?
[OTH],"We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny."
[OTH],"Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct."
[OTH],"Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here."
[OTH],"Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?"
Cartman,"Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me."
[OTH],"Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!"
[OTH],(Huh?)
[OTH],I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...
[OTH],We're all going to die in this horrible place.
[OTH],We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
[OTH],How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
[OTH],There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts.
[OTH],"Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts."
[OTH],Eat Eric Roberts!
Cartman,"No! No, please!"
[OTH],"Well, there's no going back now. We're cannibals. God save us."
[OTH],"God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!"
[OTH],"Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected."
[OTH],Aaww.
[OTH],"This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it."
[OTH],"What time is it, Barbrady?"
[OTH],It's almost midnight.
[OTH],Oh! I can't... go on.
[OTH],"We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again."
[OTH],"What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?"
[OTH],"Team B? Come in, Team B."
[OTH],(This is Team B.)
[OTH],"Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage."
[OTH],(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
[OTH],"Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left."
[OTH],(Yup! I see it in the drift.)
[OTH],Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
Cartman,"What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?"
[OTH],"My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive."
[OTH],"It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who."
[OTH],Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?
[OTH],"(Okay, I've reached the generator)"
[OTH],"Roger, Team B. He's reached the backup generator. Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?"
[OTH],(Roger.)
[OTH],"Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?"
[OTH],(Negative.)
[OTH],"Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed."
[OTH],D'you have any wire here?
[OTH],There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
[OTH],(I'll stick 'em together)
[OTH],"No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands."
[OTH],"No, he'll die!"
Cartman,"Go, Kenny!"
[OTH],Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
[OTH],(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],The power!
[OTH],Quickly! Get the scanner running again!
[OTH],We've got a chance now!
[OTH],"Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you."
[OTH],"Oh, thank you, thank you."
[OTH],We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately.
[OTH],Terminated?
[OTH],"Why yes, that's what an abortion is."
[OTH],Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
[OTH],Adoption?
[OTH],"Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption."
[OTH],"Well, that's- pretty different."
[OTH],"Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President."
[OTH],"Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine."
[OTH],Where... where am I?
[OTH],"You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--"
[OTH],Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
[OTH],Ooohhh.
[OTH],Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
[OTH],He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
[OTH],"He was a good friend, and I'll miss him."
[OTH],He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
Cartman,Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.
[OTH],"Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?"
[OTH],I don't know. Let's find out.
[OTH],Ohh. It's over! We're free!
[OTH],"Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?"
[OTH],"Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there."
[OTH],But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
[OTH],"Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time."
[OTH],Ave Maria...
[OTH],"Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?"
[OTH],"I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--"
Cartman,Just tell us already!
[OTH],"Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--"
Cartman,Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
[OTH],"Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman."
[OTH],What???
[OTH],"Yes, it's true."
[OTH],"Noo, that doesn't make sense!"
[OTH],"Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite."
[OTH],Uh-meaning what?
[OTH],Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
[OTH],It's true.
[OTH],"You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!"
[OTH],"No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis."
[OTH],"The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance."
Cartman,"Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak."
[OTH],"Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry I never told you, Eric."
[OTH],"I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you."
Cartman,"Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!"
[OTH],"Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing."
Cartman,"No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!"
[OTH],Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
Cartman,"Ooohhh, forget it!"
[OTH],"Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus."
Cartman,Reading sucks ass.
[OTH],"Eric, shut up!"
[OTH],Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
[OTH],Hey you guys. Check out these books. Sabrina Unchained.
[OTH],"Wow, these books look cool!"
Cartman,"Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books."
[OTH],(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
[OTH],"Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading."
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading."
Cartman,"God, shut up, dude."
[OTH],Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic.
[OTH],"If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?"
[OTH],"Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical."
Cartman,"I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these."
[OTH],"(Hey, what's that?)"
[OTH],I don't know. Let's go see.
[OTH],"Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong."
[OTH],All units. All units. Report to 254 Avenue de los Mexicanos. Possible hostile situation.
[OTH],"There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town!"
[OTH],"And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home."
[OTH],Goddammit!
[OTH],"Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here. What's the trouble? Where's the body?"
[OTH],"Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens."
[OTH],Uhhhh... oh.
[OTH],"My God, that's disgusting!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?"
[OTH],"Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see. Did you get a good look at the suspect?"
[OTH],"Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast."
[OTH],"Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?"
[OTH],"Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond."
[OTH],"Haw, camel poo."
[OTH],"Hey, what's this?"
[OTH],It looks like a note.
[OTH],"Give me that! That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!"
[OTH],What does it say?
[OTH],"Uhh... It says, uuh, ""Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye."" Well, there you have it. Case closed."
[OTH],"Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say ""Nothin' to see here"", and ""Case closed."" But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!"
[OTH],"I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people."
[OTH],For what? Orderly conduct?
[OTH],How about fishing without a license?
[OTH],I'm not fishin'.
[OTH],Whataya call this then?
[OTH],"If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you... by gunshot to the head."
[OTH],"That's right, return to your simple lives. Just forget this ever happened. Forget."
[OTH],For-get.
[OTH],Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
[OTH],"Yeah, I wonder what's wrong."
[OTH],Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?
[OTH],"Sir, can I help you?"
[OTH],"Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers."
[OTH],"Sure, there's just one problem."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],We're a bank.
[OTH],"I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Hmmm. I can't go on living this lie!
[OTH],"With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions."
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act?"
[OTH],"Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established."
[OTH],Do the police have any leads?
[OTH],"Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet."
[OTH],But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime?
[OTH],"All right, all right! I can't read!"
[OTH],"There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire!"
[OTH],"Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front."
[OTH],"And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while--"
[OTH],This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy!
[OTH],"Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town!"
[OTH],"Whoopee, this is killer!"
[OTH],"With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, what's going on?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed--"
[OTH],"Oh, never mind."
[OTH],"I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful."
[OTH],Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.
[OTH],He is.
[OTH],What do you plan to do about the South Park riots?
[OTH],No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
[OTH],But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do?
[OTH],"Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--"
[OTH],"Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately."
[OTH],"Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady!"
[OTH],"Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],"I can't see, dude!"
[OTH],"Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics."
[OTH],"E-yes, what is it?"
[OTH],I need to go poopies.
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class."
[OTH],"Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?"
[OTH],"Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?"
[OTH],How about a brain transplant?
[OTH],"Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it."
[OTH],"Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],Ahhh... O... O--
[OTH],"Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha hahahaha! Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones."
[OTH],"Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared."
[OTH],Ahhh... O...
[OTH],"Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard!"
[OTH],Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
[OTH],"No, we just fake it to shut him up."
[OTH],"Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again."
[OTH],"So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this?"
[OTH],"Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports."
[OTH],"Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see..."
Cartman,"Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?"
[OTH],"Eric, why don't you go first?"
Cartman,Oooaaagh.
[OTH],"What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?"
Cartman,I'm prepared!
Cartman,"For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],"No, I can't say that I have."
Cartman,"Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus."
[OTH],"And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!"
Cartman,God-dammit!
[OTH],Haa haa. Ha ha ha.
[OTH],"Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?"
[OTH],"I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: ""Big... dog..., little... dog. A red dog... on a..."" Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life."
[OTH],"Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A."
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,Goody two-shoes.
[OTH],"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
""Whoosh!"" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes"
[OTH],"Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much."
[OTH],"Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?"
[OTH],"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go..."
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?!"
[OTH],(Daaarrrggghh--)
[OTH],(-ooggghhh...)
[OTH],"Oh, my God! They've killed--"
[OTH],(Hey.)
[OTH],"Oh, never mind."
[OTH],"Well, how's the reading coming along?"
[OTH],"Oooh, pretty good."
[OTH],"Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night."
[OTH],Oh no!.
[OTH],"Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover."
[OTH],This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic.
[OTH],Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?
[OTH],The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene.
[OTH],"Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's."
[OTH],"You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!"
[OTH],I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
[OTH],"Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!"
[OTH],"Hey, what'd you do that for?"
[OTH],"Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry."
[OTH],"Oh boy, I'm in big trouble."
[OTH],"I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos."
[OTH],"It's cool, dude. We'll help you."
[OTH],"Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis."
Cartman,Really? I wanna be a cop.
[OTH],"You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset."
Cartman,Do I get a nightstick?
[OTH],"Sure, nightsticks for everybody!"
[OTH],"You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case."
Cartman,"10-4, sergeant!"
[OTH],"Now, what did that clue say again?"
[OTH],"""If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft""."
[OTH],"To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Good day, friends. Welcome to the magical world of reading."
[OTH],We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!
[OTH],"Oohhh, that's a very magical book, full of wondrous--"
[OTH],"Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake!"
[OTH],What's it say?
[OTH],"It says, ""Mmmuh mmmuuh..."" Uh, what's this word?"
[OTH],I.
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. ""I... mmuh mmuh--"""
[OTH],"Here, give me that. ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."""
[OTH],"A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond."
[OTH],"That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!"
Cartman,Ey!
[OTH],"Uhh, yes, Officer?"
Cartman,I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
[OTH],"Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour."
Cartman,"Step out of the car, please, sir."
[OTH],Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car, please."
[OTH],Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
Cartman,"Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!"
[OTH],"Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy."
[OTH],Ow!
Cartman,Get your ass to jail!
[OTH],"Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!"
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],Ooww!
[OTH],"Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!"
[OTH],"Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind."
[OTH],"Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken?"
[OTH],I would.
[OTH],"Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs!"
[OTH],Oh... yeah.
[OTH],"Have some respect for people's feelings, would you, Halfy?!"
[OTH],"Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue."
[OTH],"Here! Here, I found one!"
[OTH],What's it say? What's it say?
[OTH],"It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?"
[OTH],I dunno.
[OTH],"""Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist."" I read it! I read it all by myself!"
[OTH],"Hooray, yeah! Whoo!"
[OTH],Five George is en route to 496 Broad Wasteland...
Cartman,"Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you. Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them."
[OTH],"Hi there, little lady."
Cartman,"Well, hi there."
Cartman,"Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?"
[OTH],"Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?"
Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car, please."
[OTH],"What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?"
Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car."
[OTH],"Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!"
Cartman,Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.
[OTH],"Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!"
Cartman,Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
[OTH],I got a TV.
[OTH],Shh. Come on!
[OTH],"""Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..."" Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!"
[OTH],"How's it goin', dude?"
[OTH],"Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo."
[OTH],"Come on, dude, it's not that hard!"
[OTH],"It is, too!"
[OTH],Just read the sentence.
[OTH],"""Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"""
[OTH],"Come on, dumbass, you can do it!"
[OTH],"""Pet--"" Wait a minute."
[OTH],Conjugate the verb. Conjugate the verb.
[OTH],"Yes, conjugate the verb."
[OTH],"Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!"
[OTH],"All units, all units. Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance."
Cartman,"Sir, could you step out of the car, please?"
[OTH],"We're fine, officer."
Cartman,"And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?"
[OTH],Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids--
[OTH],"(Hi, Cartman.)"
[OTH],"--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year."
Cartman,Poor people tend to live in clusters.
[OTH],What—What did you say?
Cartman,"Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a..."
[OTH],I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
[OTH],"Shut up, bitch!"
Cartman,"Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh."
[OTH],You lazy-ass motherfucker!
[OTH],Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
[OTH],I'll do it again!
[OTH],Mom hit Dad again!
Cartman,"Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!"
[OTH],Aagh!
[OTH],All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!
Cartman,Chickenlover!
[OTH],"Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute."
[OTH],Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
[OTH],"Yeah, maybe you read it wrong."
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],Shhh!
[OTH],Keep your eyes peeled.
[OTH],Look!
[OTH],He's here!
[OTH],Grab him!
Cartman,Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed--"
[OTH],"(Oh, it was only my jacket.)"
[OTH],Goddammit!
[OTH],"I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!"
[OTH],"Aw, I think that's a mask, dude."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!"
[OTH],Caught you red-handed!
[OTH],"Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?"
[OTH],By reading Teetle the Timid Taxidermist.
[OTH],You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly!
[OTH],"What are you talking about, dude?!"
[OTH],"When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!"
[OTH],So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
[OTH],"Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate."
[OTH],"That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude."
[OTH],"Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!"
[OTH],I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.
[OTH],"Well, I guess I should say ""Thanks?"""
[OTH],"You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand."
Cartman,Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
[OTH],"Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens."
Cartman,A-ha!
[OTH],"Ow, that hurts!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Cartman!
[OTH],"No, no, that's not how you uphold the law!"
Cartman,"Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!"
[OTH],"Oohhh, ohh, you've got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this:"
[OTH],Heee--!
[OTH],You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
Cartman,Ooohhhh.
[OTH],"I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?"
[OTH],"Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Hey! So what are you going to do now?
[OTH],"Now? Well, I-ee uh... I think I'll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book."
[OTH],And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case.
[OTH],"Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
[OTH],Speech! Speech!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days."
[OTH],"Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah!"
[OTH],"Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered! And finally, I'd like to say that reading totally sucks ass!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!"
[OTH],Hooray for Barbrady!
[OTH],Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
Cartman,"Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys."
[OTH],"I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back."
[OTH],It's poetic justice.
[OTH],"Thanks, boys."
[OTH],(Ow!)
[OTH],"Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus."
Cartman,Reading sucks ass.
[OTH],"Eric, shut up!"
[OTH],Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
[OTH],Hey you guys. Check out these books. Sabrina Unchained.
[OTH],"Wow, these books look cool!"
Cartman,"Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books."
[OTH],(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
[OTH],"Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading."
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading."
Cartman,"God, shut up, dude."
[OTH],Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic.
[OTH],"If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?"
[OTH],"Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical."
Cartman,"I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these."
[OTH],"(Hey, what's that?)"
[OTH],I don't know. Let's go see.
[OTH],"Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong."
[OTH],All units. All units. Report to 254 Avenue de los Mexicanos. Possible hostile situation.
[OTH],"There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town!"
[OTH],"And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home."
[OTH],Goddammit!
[OTH],"Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here. What's the trouble? Where's the body?"
[OTH],"Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens."
[OTH],Uhhhh... oh.
[OTH],"My God, that's disgusting!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?"
[OTH],"Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see. Did you get a good look at the suspect?"
[OTH],"Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast."
[OTH],"Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?"
[OTH],"Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond."
[OTH],"Haw, camel poo."
[OTH],"Hey, what's this?"
[OTH],It looks like a note.
[OTH],"Give me that! That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!"
[OTH],What does it say?
[OTH],"Uhh... It says, uuh, ""Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye."" Well, there you have it. Case closed."
[OTH],"Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say ""Nothin' to see here"", and ""Case closed."" But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!"
[OTH],"I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people."
[OTH],For what? Orderly conduct?
[OTH],How about fishing without a license?
[OTH],I'm not fishin'.
[OTH],Whataya call this then?
[OTH],"If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you... by gunshot to the head."
[OTH],"That's right, return to your simple lives. Just forget this ever happened. Forget."
[OTH],For-get.
[OTH],Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
[OTH],"Yeah, I wonder what's wrong."
[OTH],Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?
[OTH],"Sir, can I help you?"
[OTH],"Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers."
[OTH],"Sure, there's just one problem."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],We're a bank.
[OTH],"I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Hmmm. I can't go on living this lie!
[OTH],"With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions."
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act?"
[OTH],"Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established."
[OTH],Do the police have any leads?
[OTH],"Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet."
[OTH],But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime?
[OTH],"All right, all right! I can't read!"
[OTH],"There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire!"
[OTH],"Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front."
[OTH],"And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while--"
[OTH],This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy!
[OTH],"Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town!"
[OTH],"Whoopee, this is killer!"
[OTH],"With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, what's going on?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed--"
[OTH],"Oh, never mind."
[OTH],"I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful."
[OTH],Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.
[OTH],He is.
[OTH],What do you plan to do about the South Park riots?
[OTH],No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
[OTH],But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do?
[OTH],"Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--"
[OTH],"Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately."
[OTH],"Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady!"
[OTH],"Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],"I can't see, dude!"
[OTH],"Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics."
[OTH],"E-yes, what is it?"
[OTH],I need to go poopies.
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class."
[OTH],"Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?"
[OTH],"Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?"
[OTH],How about a brain transplant?
[OTH],"Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it."
[OTH],"Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],Ahhh... O... O--
[OTH],"Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha hahahaha! Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones."
[OTH],"Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared."
[OTH],Ahhh... O...
[OTH],"Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard!"
[OTH],Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
[OTH],"No, we just fake it to shut him up."
[OTH],"Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again."
[OTH],"So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this?"
[OTH],"Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports."
[OTH],"Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see..."
Cartman,"Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?"
[OTH],"Eric, why don't you go first?"
Cartman,Oooaaagh.
[OTH],"What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?"
Cartman,I'm prepared!
Cartman,"For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],"No, I can't say that I have."
Cartman,"Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus."
[OTH],"And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!"
Cartman,God-dammit!
[OTH],Haa haa. Ha ha ha.
[OTH],"Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?"
[OTH],"I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: ""Big... dog..., little... dog. A red dog... on a..."" Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life."
[OTH],"Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A."
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,Goody two-shoes.
[OTH],"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
""Whoosh!"" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes"
[OTH],"Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much."
[OTH],"Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?"
[OTH],"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go..."
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?!"
[OTH],(Daaarrrggghh--)
[OTH],(-ooggghhh...)
[OTH],"Oh, my God! They've killed--"
[OTH],(Hey.)
[OTH],"Oh, never mind."
[OTH],"Well, how's the reading coming along?"
[OTH],"Oooh, pretty good."
[OTH],"Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night."
[OTH],Oh no!.
[OTH],"Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover."
[OTH],This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic.
[OTH],Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?
[OTH],The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene.
[OTH],"Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's."
[OTH],"You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!"
[OTH],I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
[OTH],"Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!"
[OTH],"Hey, what'd you do that for?"
[OTH],"Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry."
[OTH],"Oh boy, I'm in big trouble."
[OTH],"I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos."
[OTH],"It's cool, dude. We'll help you."
[OTH],"Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis."
Cartman,Really? I wanna be a cop.
[OTH],"You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset."
Cartman,Do I get a nightstick?
[OTH],"Sure, nightsticks for everybody!"
[OTH],"You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case."
Cartman,"10-4, sergeant!"
[OTH],"Now, what did that clue say again?"
[OTH],"""If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft""."
[OTH],"To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!"

Cartman,"Sir, could you step out of the car, please?"
[OTH],"We're fine, officer."
Cartman,"And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?"
[OTH],Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids--
[OTH],"(Hi, Cartman.)"
[OTH],"--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year."
Cartman,Poor people tend to live in clusters.
[OTH],What—What did you say?
Cartman,"Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a..."
[OTH],I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
[OTH],"Shut up, bitch!"
Cartman,"Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh."
[OTH],You lazy-ass motherfucker!
[OTH],Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
[OTH],I'll do it again!
[OTH],Mom hit Dad again!
Cartman,"Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!"
[OTH],Aagh!
[OTH],All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!
Cartman,Chickenlover!
[OTH],"Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute."
[OTH],Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
[OTH],"Yeah, maybe you read it wrong."
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],Shhh!
[OTH],Keep your eyes peeled.
[OTH],Look!
[OTH],He's here!
[OTH],Grab him!
Cartman,Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed--"
[OTH],"(Oh, it was only my jacket.)"
[OTH],Goddammit!
[OTH],"I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!"
[OTH],"Aw, I think that's a mask, dude."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!"
[OTH],Caught you red-handed!
[OTH],"Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?"
[OTH],By reading Teetle the Timid Taxidermist.
[OTH],You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly!
[OTH],"What are you talking about, dude?!"
[OTH],"When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!"
[OTH],So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
[OTH],"Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate."
[OTH],"That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude."
[OTH],"Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!"
[OTH],I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.
[OTH],"Well, I guess I should say ""Thanks?"""
[OTH],"You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand."
Cartman,Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
[OTH],"Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens."
Cartman,A-ha!
[OTH],"Ow, that hurts!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Cartman!
[OTH],"No, no, that's not how you uphold the law!"
Cartman,"Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!"
[OTH],"Oohhh, ohh, you've got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this:"
[OTH],Heee--!
[OTH],You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
Cartman,Ooohhhh.
[OTH],"I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?"
[OTH],"Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Hey! So what are you going to do now?
[OTH],"Now? Well, I-ee uh... I think I'll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book."
[OTH],And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case.
[OTH],"Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
[OTH],Speech! Speech!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days."
[OTH],"Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah!"
[OTH],"Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered! And finally, I'd like to say that reading totally sucks ass!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!"
[OTH],Hooray for Barbrady!
[OTH],Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
Cartman,"Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys."
[OTH],"I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back."
[OTH],It's poetic justice.
[OTH],"Thanks, boys."
[OTH],(Ow!)
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],Booooo!
[OTH],"Nuh-now, who was that?"
[OTH],"That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again."
[OTH],"We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Uh, okay, okay, that's fine."
Cartman,M'kay?
[OTH],"M'kay. Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad."
[OTH],"You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad."
[OTH],"You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. M'kay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?"
[OTH],"Yes, Stan?"
[OTH],Why do dogs have cold noses?
[OTH],"Uhhh, well, I'm not sure."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana."
[OTH],"Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,"
[OTH],"...so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,"
[OTH],"...and when it gets back up to me,"
[OTH],"...we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you..."
[OTH],"Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?"
[OTH],"Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?"
[OTH],"No, it's his bris."
Cartman,"What the hell is a ""bris""?"
[OTH],"I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band."
Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!"
[OTH],"...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?"
[OTH],No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.
[OTH],"Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney..."
[OTH],"Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?"
[OTH],Uhhh... I'm not sure.
[OTH],"Well, dude, you better find out!"
[OTH],"Boys, are you paying attention?"
[OTH],"Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?"
[OTH],"Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?"
[OTH],"Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?"
[OTH],Woh-oh.
[OTH],"I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid?"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria."
[OTH],"We-hell, ""sorry"" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school."
[OTH],You mean I'm fired?
[OTH],"Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes."
[OTH],"But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--"
[OTH],"It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty."
[OTH],But--
[OTH],"We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!"
[OTH],"Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m- m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??"
[OTH],"There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff."
[OTH],No-uho-uho-uho! Not o-uho-uhokay!
[OTH],AHHHHHHH!!!!
[OTH],"Man! That sucked, getting searched."
Cartman,"Yeah, my ass is killing me."
[OTH],Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
Cartman,I wonder who took it.
[OTH],And now it's almost time for BoBo's.
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How's it going?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?"
[OTH],"No, dude, we never even saw it!"
[OTH],Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
[OTH],"We know, we know, that's what everybody says."
[OTH],Right. But do you know why they're bad?
[OTH],"Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits."
[OTH],And do you have any idea what that means?
[OTH],No.
Cartman,"I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck."
[OTH],"Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?"
[OTH],"Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!"
[OTH],What do ya mean?
[OTH],Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
Cartman,Wo-what's that?
[OTH],Oh boy. Here we go again.
[OTH],Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
[OTH],"Ahhh, bicycles?"
Cartman,Ham?
[OTH],"No, not ham, you fat fuck!"
Cartman,"Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?"
[OTH],"No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body."
[OTH],Your heart?
[OTH],Your eyes?
[OTH],"(Ooh, the penis!)"
[OTH],That's right.
Cartman,"Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman."
[OTH],"A ""fireman""?"
Cartman,"That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking."
[OTH],"Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?"
[OTH],Ask your parents for once!
[OTH],"Hey, wait!"
[OTH],"Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good."
[OTH],"Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My four-year-old needs a fix! Yehahahahaha!"
[OTH],"Hey, Mackey! Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common, d'oh-pe! Ha ha ha ha!"
[OTH],"Heeey, Mackey!"
[OTH],"Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross the road?"
[OTH],"Who do you think you are, you stupid drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies are all alike!"
[OTH],Won't you leave the guy alone?
[OTH],"Hey, hippie, are you gonna do some drugs?"
[OTH],Uuuuuugh!
[OTH],"Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before."
[OTH],"Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job."
[OTH],"Oh that's weak, man. You know what you need? You need a good, stiff drink."
[OTH],"Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Trust me, man! It'll make you feel better."
[OTH],Ughuh... Drinkin's bad.
[OTH],Go ahead. Drink the beer. It'll calm you down.
[OTH],"Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a beer. Don't be such a pussy, m'kay?"
[OTH],So how do you feel?
[OTH],"Woah, about the same."
[OTH],"Oh, you just need something a little stronger."
[OTH],Kyle! You have to stop them!
[OTH],Stop who?
[OTH],Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
[OTH],Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
[OTH],"Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!"
Cartman,Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
[OTH],That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
[OTH],"Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris."
Cartman,"Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!"
[OTH],I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad!
[OTH],"We are young, m'kay?
Heartache to heartache we stand, m'kay?
No promises, no demands, m-m'kay..?"
[OTH],Whoa... Is this my house?
[OTH],"Your key ain't gonna work, Mackey! I changed the locks!"
[OTH],"Why, Mr. Freely?"
[OTH],I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard that you got fired from your job for selling drugs to children!
[OTH],"No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that."
[OTH],"Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having never taken drugs, I can say that they have nothing to offer!"
[OTH],But I've never taken drugs either.
[OTH],"I've never taken drugs, and look at me! I'm totally fine! Now get off my property before I lose control and kill you!"
[OTH],Huuhh?
[OTH],"Ow, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Drug user! Druuug user!
[OTH],"Uh, uh--"
[OTH],"Come back here, dammit!"
[OTH],"Whoa, wait!"
[OTH],Just a little higher.
[OTH],Mom! Dad!
[OTH],"Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party."
[OTH],Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
Cartman,What the hell is gahekgafuga?
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?"
[OTH],To celebrate your little brother's passage into life.
[OTH],Meaning what?
[OTH],Meaning we're going to circumcise him.
Cartman,They are gonna cut off his fireman!
[OTH],"It's Jewish tradition, bubbe."
[OTH],"Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--"
[OTH],AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!
[OTH],"Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him?"
[OTH],"Let us cut off you pee pee, Stan!"
Cartman,"AAAAGGGGHHHH!!!! Aaagg-that's the sickest friggin' thing-run, ruuun!"
[OTH],"(Run, dude!)"
[OTH],"Oy, what is the matter with them?"
[OTH],I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
[OTH],"What are you goin' to do, dude?"
[OTH],I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!
[OTH],"Come on, Ike!"
[OTH],Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
Cartman,"No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!"
[OTH],"Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike!"
[OTH],"Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Hey, you want somethin' to warm you up?"
[OTH],"Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken."
[OTH],"Here, try this; it'll warm you up."
[OTH],Marijuwana's bad.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay?"
[OTH],And you don't fell that way now?
[OTH],"Oh, good point."
[OTH],"No, I don't feel any d-oooohh..."
[OTH],"Oh, baby, get down, m'kay?"
[OTH],Uh-huh.
[OTH],"Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful!"
[OTH],"Ohh, boy."
[OTH],"Come on, Ike, hurry up! Where is the next train going?"
[OTH],"Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes."
[OTH],"You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],I need one ticket for my little brother.
[OTH],That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train."
[OTH],But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
[OTH],What?! Why the hell would they do that?
[OTH],"They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses."
[OTH],"No can do, sonny."
[OTH],Dammit!
[OTH],"Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train."
[OTH],"Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!"
[OTH],Don't kick the--
[OTH],"Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!"
[OTH],Bye-bye.
[OTH],"Oh, man, where am I?"
[OTH],"Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary school, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],"Wow, dude."
[OTH],"Uh, hi, boys, how are you today?"
[OTH],"Pretty good, man. How are you?"
[OTH],"Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs."
[OTH],"Hey! Us, too!"
[OTH],"Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking weed in the bathroom and got us suspended."
[OTH],"Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?"
[OTH],"Oh, cheer up, bro; all you need is some clear liquid to get your head straight."
[OTH],"Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm..."
[OTH],"Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?"
[OTH],"Yeah, baby... The world is so small."
[OTH],I'm free... I'm free...
[OTH],"Sweet dude, totally killer."
[OTH],That guy's totally trippin'.
[OTH],"There, what do you think?"
Cartman,What the hell is that supposed to be?
[OTH],"I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner."
[OTH],"Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike."
[OTH],Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.
[OTH],"No, go away! Bad dog!"
[OTH],"Dude, what did you make that doll out of?"
[OTH],I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Cartman,Is that why it stinks so bad?
[OTH],"Hi, boys."
[OTH],"Hi, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],Are you boys stayin' out of trouble?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while."
[OTH],"Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone."
[OTH],"Knock it off, asshole!"
Cartman,No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
[OTH],"Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you."
Cartman,Eech.
Cartman,"Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can."
[OTH],Yeah. No more walbolching!
[OTH],"Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes."
[OTH],"Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky."
[OTH],How is my little jellybean?
[OTH],"Bye-bye seeme mama. Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up."
[OTH],"Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss."
[OTH],"No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him."
[OTH],"Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop!"
[OTH],AAAGGGHH!!!
[OTH],"Put him down, you stupid dog!"
[OTH],"My baby! Oh, God, the horror!"
[OTH],"Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go!"
[OTH],"Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!"
[OTH],Waagghh!!
[OTH],My baby!!
[OTH],Huuh?
[OTH],Aaaggghhh! Aaagh aaagghh!
[OTH],"Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!"
[OTH],"There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do."
[OTH],"""Yea, usher us unto the Lord"", sayeth some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
[OTH],"Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?"
[OTH],"Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same."
[OTH],"You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!"
[OTH],What are you talking about?
[OTH],"Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!"
[OTH],What-what-whaaat?!
[OTH],"Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!"
Cartman,Fireman!
[OTH],"Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility."
[OTH],(Hey!)
[OTH],"(Hey, you guys! I'm dy--)"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards.
[OTH],"""Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."""
[OTH],"Get outta the way, you damn hippie!"
[OTH],I don't need to take you right-wing authoritative bullshit!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert?"
[OTH],"I can't, man. Jerry Bear's dead, m'kay?"
[OTH],"He-e-ey, man, I overheard what you said; that was coool!"
[OTH],"What? Oh, thanks, man."
[OTH],Would you like to come over to my place and finger-paint?
[OTH],"Sure, man. Finger-paintin's cool, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Now, where did you leave him, young man?"
[OTH],"Aw, how the hell should I know?"
[OTH],Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son!
[OTH],"Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass."
[OTH],"If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!"
[OTH],"Ike, love?"
[OTH],"All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother."
[OTH],"Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother."
[OTH],"Yeah, right."
[OTH],"Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy."
[OTH],"Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar."
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],Ike!
[OTH],Mamatoedoe.
[OTH],"Hey, lady, that's my table post! You can't have that!"
[OTH],"Wow, man. You know, it's like… You go through life thinking that you're an individual, m'kay? And then you realize that you're more than that, m'kay. We're all just one big individual, m'kay?"
[OTH],Let's get married and have a honeymoon in India.
[OTH],M'kay.
[OTH],"Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!"
[OTH],"But first, apologize to your brother!"
[OTH],He's not my brother!
[OTH],Apologize to him!
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Ike."
[OTH],"Uh oh, stufid."
[OTH],"Wooow, this is sooo beautiful!"
[OTH],I am one with the animals. And the trees.
[OTH],And I am one with you.
[OTH],"At long last I have found
A true reason to be
Now I feel I can start anew--"
[OTH],"Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey!"
[OTH],Uh oh hel-m. Hey!
[OTH],Whoa...
[OTH],"Yeah I got, m'kay?"
[OTH],Uh-- What the hell is going on?!
[OTH],"Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab."
[OTH],I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
[OTH],"We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help."
[OTH],"Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need."
[OTH],I don't want help!
[OTH],You'll thank us later.
[OTH],"Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris."
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],"Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray!"
[OTH],"Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?"
[OTH],"He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted."
[OTH],Hi there!
[OTH],Hello. Do I know you?
[OTH],"Uh-no, but I never miss a bris. Here, I brought some dip."
[OTH],"Ohhh, thanks."
Cartman,"Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence."
[OTH],Oh deh family nrr.
[OTH],What do you want?!
[OTH],I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr.
[OTH],"Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!"
[OTH],"Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude."
[OTH],No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
[OTH],"Cookie Monster, two, three, four, five."
[OTH],"Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!"
[OTH],Baraterndr nfard fy.
[OTH],You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you.
[OTH],But I don't think I really have a problem.
[OTH],Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family.
[OTH],I don't really have a family.
[OTH],And you lost your job.
[OTH],"No, I lost my job before that."
[OTH],"Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult."
[OTH],"The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad."
[OTH],Drugs are baad.
[OTH],Drugs are bad.
[OTH],Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad.
[OTH],"Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris."
[OTH],"Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one."
[OTH],Where is the little rug rat?
[OTH],Right over here.
[OTH],"Come 'ere, you."
[OTH],Oowwww!
[OTH],Oh deh faminrr.
[OTH],Ike? Ike?
[OTH],Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr.
[OTH],"There you are. Come on Ike, it's time."
[OTH],You stay away from my little brother!
[OTH],"Bu-bu-but, son, I just--"
[OTH],"You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!"
[OTH],"Kyle, what are you talking about?"
[OTH],And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
Cartman,"Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye."
[OTH],"Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and..."
[OTH],...his brother had it.
[OTH],"No! No, it isn't true!"
[OTH],"We're not going to cut it off! We're just goin' to snip it, so it looks bigger."
[OTH],"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!"
Cartman,"Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too."
[OTH],"Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered."
[OTH],"I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again."
[OTH],Just one more thing.
[OTH],Remember that you can stay sober.
[OTH],"I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will. M'kay?"
[OTH],"It's okay, Ike. I'm here."
[OTH],And-a one and-a two and-a... bris.
[OTH],Ouch. Buh-buh-buh-buh.
[OTH],Cookie Monster.
[OTH],"Ike, you're okay."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad."
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family. Except for Cartman.
[OTH],Naturally.
Cartman,"Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!"
[OTH],"And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol."
[OTH],"Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life..."
Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?"
[OTH],"You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine."
Cartman,"No way, I set up mine first, hippie!"
[OTH],"Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?"
[OTH],M'kay.
[OTH],M'kay?
[OTH],M'kay.
Cartman,Okay?
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?"
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],Booooo!
[OTH],"Nuh-now, who was that?"
[OTH],"That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again."
[OTH],"We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Uh, okay, okay, that's fine."
Cartman,M'kay?
[OTH],"M'kay. Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad."
[OTH],"You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad."
[OTH],"You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. M'kay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?"
[OTH],"Yes, Stan?"
[OTH],Why do dogs have cold noses?
[OTH],"Uhhh, well, I'm not sure."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana."
[OTH],"Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,"
[OTH],"...so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,"
[OTH],"...and when it gets back up to me,"
[OTH],"...we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you..."
[OTH],"Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?"
[OTH],"Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?"
[OTH],"No, it's his bris."
Cartman,"What the hell is a ""bris""?"
[OTH],"I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band."
Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!"
[OTH],"...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?"
[OTH],No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.
[OTH],"Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney..."
[OTH],"Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?"
[OTH],Uhhh... I'm not sure.
[OTH],"Well, dude, you better find out!"
[OTH],"Boys, are you paying attention?"
[OTH],"Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?"
[OTH],"Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?"
[OTH],"Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?"
[OTH],Woh-oh.
[OTH],"I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid?"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria."
[OTH],"We-hell, ""sorry"" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school."
[OTH],You mean I'm fired?
[OTH],"Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes."
[OTH],"But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--"
[OTH],"It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty."
[OTH],But--
[OTH],"We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!"
[OTH],"Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m- m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??"
[OTH],"There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff."
[OTH],No-uho-uho-uho! Not o-uho-uhokay!
[OTH],AHHHHHHH!!!!
[OTH],"Man! That sucked, getting searched."
Cartman,"Yeah, my ass is killing me."
[OTH],Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
Cartman,I wonder who took it.
[OTH],And now it's almost time for BoBo's.
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How's it going?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],"Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?"
[OTH],"No, dude, we never even saw it!"
[OTH],Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
[OTH],"We know, we know, that's what everybody says."
[OTH],Right. But do you know why they're bad?
[OTH],"Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits."
[OTH],And do you have any idea what that means?
[OTH],No.
Cartman,"I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck."
[OTH],"Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?"
[OTH],"Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!"
[OTH],What do ya mean?
[OTH],Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
Cartman,Wo-what's that?
[OTH],Oh boy. Here we go again.
[OTH],Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
[OTH],"Ahhh, bicycles?"
Cartman,Ham?
[OTH],"No, not ham, you fat fuck!"
Cartman,"Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?"
[OTH],"No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body."
[OTH],Your heart?
[OTH],Your eyes?
[OTH],"(Ooh, the penis!)"
[OTH],That's right.
Cartman,"Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman."
[OTH],"A ""fireman""?"
Cartman,"That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking."
[OTH],"Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?"
[OTH],Ask your parents for once!
[OTH],"Hey, wait!"
[OTH],"Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good."
[OTH],"Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My four-year-old needs a fix! Yehahahahaha!"
[OTH],"Hey, Mackey! Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common, d'oh-pe! Ha ha ha ha!"
[OTH],"Heeey, Mackey!"
[OTH],"Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross the road?"
[OTH],"Who do you think you are, you stupid drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies are all alike!"
[OTH],Won't you leave the guy alone?
[OTH],"Hey, hippie, are you gonna do some drugs?"
[OTH],Uuuuuugh!
[OTH],"Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before."
[OTH],"Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job."
[OTH],"Oh that's weak, man. You know what you need? You need a good, stiff drink."
[OTH],"Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Trust me, man! It'll make you feel better."
[OTH],Ughuh... Drinkin's bad.
[OTH],Go ahead. Drink the beer. It'll calm you down.
[OTH],"Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a beer. Don't be such a pussy, m'kay?"
[OTH],So how do you feel?
[OTH],"Woah, about the same."
[OTH],"Oh, you just need something a little stronger."
[OTH],Kyle! You have to stop them!
[OTH],Stop who?
[OTH],Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
[OTH],Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
[OTH],"Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!"
Cartman,Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
[OTH],That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
[OTH],"Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris."
Cartman,"Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!"
[OTH],I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad!
[OTH],"We are young, m'kay?
Heartache to heartache we stand, m'kay?
No promises, no demands, m-m'kay..?"
[OTH],Whoa... Is this my house?
[OTH],"Your key ain't gonna work, Mackey! I changed the locks!"
[OTH],"Why, Mr. Freely?"
[OTH],I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard that you got fired from your job for selling drugs to children!
[OTH],"No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that."
[OTH],"Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having never taken drugs, I can say that they have nothing to offer!"
[OTH],But I've never taken drugs either.
[OTH],"I've never taken drugs, and look at me! I'm totally fine! Now get off my property before I lose control and kill you!"
[OTH],Huuhh?
[OTH],"Ow, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Drug user! Druuug user!
[OTH],"Uh, uh--"
[OTH],"Come back here, dammit!"
[OTH],"Whoa, wait!"
[OTH],Just a little higher.
[OTH],Mom! Dad!
[OTH],"Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party."
[OTH],Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
Cartman,What the hell is gahekgafuga?
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?"
[OTH],To celebrate your little brother's passage into life.
[OTH],Meaning what?
[OTH],Meaning we're going to circumcise him.
Cartman,They are gonna cut off his fireman!
[OTH],"It's Jewish tradition, bubbe."
[OTH],"Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--"
[OTH],AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!
[OTH],"Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him?"
[OTH],"Let us cut off you pee pee, Stan!"
Cartman,"AAAAGGGGHHHH!!!! Aaagg-that's the sickest friggin' thing-run, ruuun!"
[OTH],"(Run, dude!)"
[OTH],"Oy, what is the matter with them?"
[OTH],I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
[OTH],"What are you goin' to do, dude?"
[OTH],I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!
[OTH],"Come on, Ike!"
[OTH],Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
Cartman,"No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!"
[OTH],"Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike!"
[OTH],"Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Hey, you want somethin' to warm you up?"
[OTH],"Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken."
[OTH],"Here, try this; it'll warm you up."
[OTH],Marijuwana's bad.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay?"
[OTH],And you don't fell that way now?
[OTH],"Oh, good point."
[OTH],"No, I don't feel any d-oooohh..."
[OTH],"Oh, baby, get down, m'kay?"
[OTH],Uh-huh.
[OTH],"Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful!"
[OTH],"Ohh, boy."
[OTH],"Come on, Ike, hurry up! Where is the next train going?"
[OTH],"Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes."
[OTH],"You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],I need one ticket for my little brother.
[OTH],That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train."
[OTH],But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
[OTH],What?! Why the hell would they do that?
[OTH],"They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses."
[OTH],"No can do, sonny."
[OTH],Dammit!
[OTH],"Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train."
[OTH],"Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!"
[OTH],Don't kick the--
[OTH],"Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!"
[OTH],Bye-bye.
[OTH],"Oh, man, where am I?"
[OTH],"Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary school, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],"Wow, dude."
[OTH],"Uh, hi, boys, how are you today?"
[OTH],"Pretty good, man. How are you?"
[OTH],"Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs."
[OTH],"Hey! Us, too!"
[OTH],"Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking weed in the bathroom and got us suspended."
[OTH],"Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?"
[OTH],"Oh, cheer up, bro; all you need is some clear liquid to get your head straight."
[OTH],"Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm..."
[OTH],"Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?"
[OTH],"Yeah, baby... The world is so small."
[OTH],I'm free... I'm free...
[OTH],"Sweet dude, totally killer."
[OTH],That guy's totally trippin'.
[OTH],"There, what do you think?"
Cartman,What the hell is that supposed to be?
[OTH],"I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner."
[OTH],"Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike."
[OTH],Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.
[OTH],"No, go away! Bad dog!"
[OTH],"Dude, what did you make that doll out of?"
[OTH],I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Cartman,Is that why it stinks so bad?
[OTH],"Hi, boys."
[OTH],"Hi, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],Are you boys stayin' out of trouble?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while."
[OTH],"Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone."
[OTH],"Knock it off, asshole!"
Cartman,No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
[OTH],"Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you."
Cartman,Eech.
Cartman,"Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can."
[OTH],Yeah. No more walbolching!
[OTH],"Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes."
[OTH],"Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky."
[OTH],How is my little jellybean?
[OTH],"Bye-bye seeme mama. Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up."
[OTH],"Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss."
[OTH],"No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him."
[OTH],"Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop!"
[OTH],AAAGGGHH!!!
[OTH],"Put him down, you stupid dog!"
[OTH],"My baby! Oh, God, the horror!"
[OTH],"Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go!"
[OTH],"Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!"
[OTH],Waagghh!!
[OTH],My baby!!
[OTH],Huuh?
[OTH],Aaaggghhh! Aaagh aaagghh!
[OTH],"Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!"
[OTH],"There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do."
[OTH],"""Yea, usher us unto the Lord"", sayeth some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
[OTH],"Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?"
[OTH],"Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same."
[OTH],"You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!"
[OTH],What are you talking about?
[OTH],"Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!"
[OTH],What-what-whaaat?!
[OTH],"Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!"
Cartman,Fireman!
[OTH],"Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility."
[OTH],(Hey!)
[OTH],"(Hey, you guys! I'm dy--)"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards.
[OTH],"""Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."""
[OTH],"Get outta the way, you damn hippie!"
[OTH],I don't need to take you right-wing authoritative bullshit!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert?"
[OTH],"I can't, man. Jerry Bear's dead, m'kay?"
[OTH],"He-e-ey, man, I overheard what you said; that was coool!"
[OTH],"What? Oh, thanks, man."
[OTH],Would you like to come over to my place and finger-paint?
[OTH],"Sure, man. Finger-paintin's cool, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Now, where did you leave him, young man?"
[OTH],"Aw, how the hell should I know?"
[OTH],Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son!
[OTH],"Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass."
[OTH],"If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!"
[OTH],"Ike, love?"
[OTH],"All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother."
[OTH],"Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother."
[OTH],"Yeah, right."
[OTH],"Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy."
[OTH],"Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar."
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],Ike!
[OTH],Mamatoedoe.
[OTH],"Hey, lady, that's my table post! You can't have that!"
[OTH],"Wow, man. You know, it's like… You go through life thinking that you're an individual, m'kay? And then you realize that you're more than that, m'kay. We're all just one big individual, m'kay?"
[OTH],Let's get married and have a honeymoon in India.
[OTH],M'kay.
[OTH],"Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!"
[OTH],"But first, apologize to your brother!"
[OTH],He's not my brother!
[OTH],Apologize to him!
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Ike."
[OTH],"Uh oh, stufid."
[OTH],"Wooow, this is sooo beautiful!"
[OTH],I am one with the animals. And the trees.
[OTH],And I am one with you.
[OTH],"At long last I have found
A true reason to be
Now I feel I can start anew--"
[OTH],"Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey!"
[OTH],Uh oh hel-m. Hey!
[OTH],Whoa...
[OTH],"Yeah I got, m'kay?"
[OTH],Uh-- What the hell is going on?!
[OTH],"Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab."
[OTH],I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
[OTH],"We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help."
[OTH],"Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need."
[OTH],I don't want help!
[OTH],You'll thank us later.
[OTH],"Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris."
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],"Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray!"
[OTH],"Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?"
[OTH],"He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted."
[OTH],Hi there!
[OTH],Hello. Do I know you?
[OTH],"Uh-no, but I never miss a bris. Here, I brought some dip."
[OTH],"Ohhh, thanks."
Cartman,"Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence."
[OTH],Oh deh family nrr.
[OTH],What do you want?!
[OTH],I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr.
[OTH],"Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!"
[OTH],"Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude."
[OTH],No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
[OTH],"Cookie Monster, two, three, four, five."
[OTH],"Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!"
[OTH],Baraterndr nfard fy.
[OTH],You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you.
[OTH],But I don't think I really have a problem.
[OTH],Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family.
[OTH],I don't really have a family.
[OTH],And you lost your job.
[OTH],"No, I lost my job before that."
[OTH],"Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult."
[OTH],"The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad."
[OTH],Drugs are baad.
[OTH],Drugs are bad.
[OTH],Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad.
[OTH],"Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris."
[OTH],"Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one."
[OTH],Where is the little rug rat?
[OTH],Right over here.
[OTH],"Come 'ere, you."
[OTH],Oowwww!
[OTH],Oh deh faminrr.
[OTH],Ike? Ike?
[OTH],Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr.
[OTH],"There you are. Come on Ike, it's time."
[OTH],You stay away from my little brother!
[OTH],"Bu-bu-but, son, I just--"
[OTH],"You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!"
[OTH],"Kyle, what are you talking about?"
[OTH],And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
Cartman,"Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye."
[OTH],"Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and..."
[OTH],...his brother had it.
[OTH],"No! No, it isn't true!"
[OTH],"We're not going to cut it off! We're just goin' to snip it, so it looks bigger."
[OTH],"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!"
Cartman,"Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too."
[OTH],"Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered."
[OTH],"I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again."
[OTH],Just one more thing.
[OTH],Remember that you can stay sober.
[OTH],"I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will. M'kay?"
[OTH],"It's okay, Ike. I'm here."
[OTH],And-a one and-a two and-a... bris.
[OTH],Ouch. Buh-buh-buh-buh.
[OTH],Cookie Monster.
[OTH],"Ike, you're okay."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad."
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family. Except for Cartman.
[OTH],Naturally.
Cartman,"Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!"
[OTH],"And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol."
[OTH],"Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life..."
Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?"
[OTH],"You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine."
Cartman,"No way, I set up mine first, hippie!"
[OTH],"Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?"
[OTH],M'kay.
[OTH],M'kay?
[OTH],M'kay.
Cartman,Okay?
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?"
[OTH],"Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball!"
[OTH],We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],So let's have half the children on this side and half the children on that side.
[OTH],"Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball."
Cartman,What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
[OTH],"Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--"
[OTH],"Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball."
[OTH],"Oh, dear."
[OTH],"If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins."
[OTH],"Oh, what jolly good fun!"
[OTH],"No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school."
[OTH],Play ball!
[OTH],Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!
[OTH],"Dammit, we lost one already!"
[OTH],"Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh."
[OTH],"Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup."
[OTH],We're losing men fast out here!
[OTH],Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall!
[OTH],I caught it! I caught it!
[OTH],"Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!"
[OTH],"Here, Pip, you throw."
[OTH],"Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't."
[OTH],"Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pansy your whole life?"
[OTH],I'm not French--
[OTH],"Throw the ball, you stupid frog!"
[OTH],"Goddamn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,"
[OTH],you'd be able to-- Ow! .
[OTH],"Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team."
[OTH],"Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!"
Cartman,"Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you."
[OTH],Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!
[OTH],"That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office."
[OTH],"No. No, it'll be okay!"
[OTH],"Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on."
[OTH],Oh-- Noooo!
Cartman,Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
[OTH],I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
[OTH],I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
Cartman,"Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?"
[OTH],"No, Cartman. Nobody ever has."
[OTH],Are you Kyle Broflovski?
[OTH],Ye-yes.
[OTH],I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
[OTH],Ye-yes.
[OTH],"Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you."
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],So open them.
[OTH],Oh! Phew.
[OTH],"Now, what seems to be the problem?"
[OTH],"Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack."
[OTH],AAGGGGGHHHH!!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
[OTH],"Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head."
[OTH],AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
[OTH],"...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled."
[OTH],Eewwww!
Cartman,"Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?"
[OTH],No. No-it looked dead.
[OTH],Eewwww!
[OTH],Wa-was it wearing clothes?
[OTH],"Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?"
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. Eeww."
[OTH],Eewwww!
[OTH],And then she walked over to--
[OTH],"Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called ""conjoined twin myslexia""."
Cartman,Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me...
[OTH],"Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys."
[OTH],"You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins."
[OTH],Gross!
[OTH],"But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached."
[OTH],"Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it!"
[OTH],AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
Cartman,AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
[OTH],"So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?"
[OTH],Uhhhh... Yeah.
[OTH],"Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?"
[OTH],Mm-hmm.
[OTH],"Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day..."
[OTH],Mm-hmm.
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother."
[OTH],"Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon."
[OTH],"Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?"
[OTH],No! I have to get it out!
[OTH],"Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia."
[OTH],So this is your fault.
[OTH],ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
[OTH],"Dammit, stop."
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],Dammit!
[OTH],"Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead?"
[OTH],That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
[OTH],Mm-hmm.
[OTH],"Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?"
Cartman,Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
[OTH],Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
[OTH],Awww...
[OTH],"Aw, do we have to?"
[OTH],Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
[OTH],"You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!"
Cartman,Heyh! They have a zoo there!
[OTH],"That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!"
[OTH],Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
[OTH],"Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?"
[OTH],I'd love to!
Cartman,"Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy."
[OTH],Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.
[OTH],"And besides, I hate French people."
[OTH],"Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?"
[OTH],Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
[OTH],O-of course you do.
[OTH],I want to talk to you all about your school nurse.
[OTH],"Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--"
[OTH],"No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of."
[OTH],"Oh, and uh, what disease is that?"
[OTH],"Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
[OTH],She does?
[OTH],Y-you never noticed that?
[OTH],"No-o, I never did."
[OTH],"Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!"
[OTH],"Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?"
[OTH],I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
[OTH],Do we have to eat kosher stuff?
[OTH],"Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8:00?"
[OTH],Wonderful!
[OTH],"Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?"
[OTH],"Okay children. Now, who's gonna win the State Finals?"
[OTH],Denver?
[OTH],"Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!"
[OTH],I think we need to get off on this exit.
[OTH],"SIT DOWN, KID!!"
[OTH],But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
[OTH],DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!
[OTH],"How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!"
[OTH],I SAID SIT DOOWWN!!!
[OTH],"Yes, ma'am."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, this is a school?"
[OTH],"Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars."
[OTH],"I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows."
[OTH],"Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are."
[OTH],"You're from South Park, yeah?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful."
[OTH],Play ball!
[OTH],"So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?"
[OTH],Colorado State.
[OTH],Ahhh.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?"
[OTH],"I mean, gravy."
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Dammit, come on!"
[OTH],Somebody catch the ball!
[OTH],"All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go!"
Cartman,"I caught it, I caught it!"
[OTH],"Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly!"
[OTH],South Park on offense!
[OTH],"Great job, children! Just stay focused now."
[OTH],"Go for it, Pip."
[OTH],"Oh, bother."
[OTH],"Come on, you Frenchy little frog!"
[OTH],Gagghh!
[OTH],"Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!"
[OTH],"Eh, sooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight."
[OTH],"Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!"
[OTH],Gerald!
[OTH],Keep your damn mouth shut!
[OTH],"I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really."
[OTH],"Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum."
[OTH],"No, I'm quite secure with it."
[OTH],I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
[OTH],They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
[OTH],Could I get some more pork?
[OTH],"So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?"
[OTH],"Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death."
[OTH],"Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?"
[OTH],"No, really, I don't need a--"
[OTH],"Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop."
[OTH],"I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person."
[OTH],I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
[OTH],"Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring."
[OTH],But I really don't think--
[OTH],"Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now!"
[OTH],"You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions."
Cartman,"Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap."
[OTH],"Get him, Frenchy!"
[OTH],Gaagghh!
[OTH],South Park wins!
[OTH],"We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!"
[OTH],Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee!
[OTH],It hur-hurts! Owieee!
[OTH],"Mommy, it huurts! I-it hur-hurts!"
[OTH],"Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!

Oooh, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals..."
[OTH],...where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.
[OTH],"But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!"
[OTH],"And now, let's kick off our week long festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!"
[OTH],Let's hear it for these brave souls!
[OTH],What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!
[OTH],"You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job."
[OTH],Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
[OTH],"How much further is Washington, D.C.?"
[OTH],"SIT DOWN, KID!!"
[OTH],"I need to know how far it is, lady!"
[OTH],I SAID SIT DOWN!!!
[OTH],"Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog."
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],"I said, ""I've always wanted to visit Prague."""
[OTH],"Oh, me too."
[OTH],"Okay, what have you got?"
[OTH],"Some hadka fish, some gafagga..."
Cartman,I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll!
[OTH],Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!
[OTH],Places!
[OTH],ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],(Sheesh!)
[OTH],"Damn, man. This is the big time, alright."
[OTH],"Chef, we're hungry."
[OTH],"You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese."
Cartman,My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Are you Chef?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions."
[OTH],"What? We did it! Children, we won!"
[OTH],"Wow, that was easy."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows!"
[OTH],"Hey, why did you guys forfeit?"
[OTH],You mean you don't know?
[OTH],Know what?
[OTH],Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.
[OTH],Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia!
[OTH],"They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals."
[OTH],"Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about."
[OTH],"Okay, children, back in the bus."
[OTH],"And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Oh, no..!"
[OTH],"You've got the strength, you've got the courage
Even with a dead fetus on your head
You carry on
You fight for tomorrow
Dead fetus or no, you never let go
You're my conjoined-twin-dead-thing-hanging-off-your-head woman"
[OTH],"Oh, that was so touching."
[OTH],"And now, friends, it's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is..."
[OTH],Nurse Gollum.
[OTH],Nurse Gollum!!
[OTH],"Oh, boy."
[OTH],"Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in."
[OTH],"Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China."
[OTH],"Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game."
[OTH],"But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!"
[OTH],"Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions."
[OTH],But we could get killed!
[OTH],And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?
[OTH],"Just imagine: a big yellow ""Dodgeball Champions"" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!"
[OTH],"Dude, Chef has lost it."
[OTH],"You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!"
Cartman,"So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?"
[OTH],"Dude, what does that mean?"
Cartman,I dunno.
[OTH],"Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?"
[OTH],"Yeah, you're from China."
[OTH],"No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese."
[OTH],Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
[OTH],"I have no idea, dude."
Cartman,"Come on, rice picker!"
[OTH],"Hey, hey hey!"
[OTH],"Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity."
[OTH],You don't?
[OTH],"But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people."
[OTH],"No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country."
[OTH],Ohhh.
Cartman,"Oooh, I get it."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],AAAGGGGHHHH!
[OTH],"Hiit ita wita great pride, that huwe huwelcome ourn American friend. Now let the..."
[OTH],...champion of dodgeball be deshide!
[OTH],"Damn, dude. China's fucked up."
[OTH],Take places!
[OTH],"All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!"
[OTH],"Okay, Tom, rooks rike A-mericans are getting ready to play. I don't suppose they'll have any problems seeing the ball with their big American eyes!"
[OTH],Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect.
[OTH],"Oh, you say such things."
[OTH],That's a zinger!
[OTH],Praaayyy braal!
[OTH],Holy crap..!
[OTH],Goddamn...
[OTH],"Hey, hey, what do you call white American person with PhD in a physics and-a math?"
[OTH],"Ah, I don't know. What?"
[OTH],Stupid American!
[OTH],"Aw, no way!!"
[OTH],"Oooh, another American is down! It's numbuh-- uuhhh... Oh, I don't know. All American look alike!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You... bastards...
[OTH],"Oooh, my, I haven't seen an American die like that since Abraham Lincoln!"
[OTH],"Dude, that is-a not cool! You're gonna get us into trouble again."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China."
[OTH],"Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats!"
[OTH],And there is-a only a one South Park prayer left.
[OTH],Still all Chinese prayer. This should be over veerry shortly.
[OTH],Come on! Throw ball!
[OTH],"Hey, you wanna hear my impersonation of American?"
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah!"
[OTH],"Ah, okay."
[OTH],"Hey, I really, really want that. That looks good."
[OTH],"Hey, hey. Let me try, let me try."
[OTH],I'll use my credit card.
[OTH],Eh-eh-uh... Do you have any non-dairy creamer?
[OTH],"Yes yes! Y'all come a-back now, you hear?"
[OTH],"Oh, what have I done?"
[OTH],"You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good."
[OTH],"If we had won the world championship, what then?"
[OTH],It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?"
[OTH],"Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home."
[OTH],Come on! Throw ball!
[OTH],"Hey, if you wanna make him throw the ball, say this."
[OTH],"Thanks, you American dumbass! ""You French piece of crap! Throw ball!"""
[OTH],"""What's the matter, Frenchy? You got crepes in your ears."""
[OTH],Arrggghhh!
[OTH],And the winner is South Park Cows!
[OTH],"Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day!"
[OTH],"Shut up, Pip."
[OTH],"Yeah, shut up, Pip. Can we go home now?"
[OTH],Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
[OTH],"Shut up, Pip!"
[OTH],"As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation."
[OTH],"Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows!"
[OTH],What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
[OTH],"And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!"
[OTH],Agghh!
[OTH],"Dude, it's the freak nurse!"
Cartman,Holy crap!
[OTH],"Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!"
[OTH],"Well sorry, dude, we weren't here."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week."
[OTH],She's really touched.
[OTH],"What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks!"
[OTH],"Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--"
[OTH],Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?
[OTH],"I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long."
[OTH],"Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other."
[OTH],And take those stupid things off your heads!
[OTH],"Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch."
[OTH],"Yeah, the nerve of some people."
[OTH],"Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool."
[OTH],"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter."
Cartman,I love you guys.
Cartman,"Ah, screw you guys!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball!"
[OTH],We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],So let's have half the children on this side and half the children on that side.
[OTH],"Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball."
Cartman,What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
[OTH],"Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--"
[OTH],"Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball."
[OTH],"Oh, dear."
[OTH],"If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins."
[OTH],"Oh, what jolly good fun!"
[OTH],"No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school."
[OTH],Play ball!
[OTH],Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!
[OTH],"Dammit, we lost one already!"
[OTH],"Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh."
[OTH],"Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup."
[OTH],We're losing men fast out here!
[OTH],Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall!
[OTH],I caught it! I caught it!
[OTH],"Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!"
[OTH],"Here, Pip, you throw."
[OTH],"Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't."
[OTH],"Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pansy your whole life?"
[OTH],I'm not French--
[OTH],"Throw the ball, you stupid frog!"
[OTH],"Goddamn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,"
[OTH],you'd be able to-- Ow! .
[OTH],"Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team."
[OTH],"Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!"
Cartman,"Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you."
[OTH],Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!
[OTH],"That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office."
[OTH],"No. No, it'll be okay!"
[OTH],"Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on."
[OTH],Oh-- Noooo!
Cartman,Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
[OTH],I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
[OTH],I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
Cartman,"Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?"
[OTH],"No, Cartman. Nobody ever has."
[OTH],Are you Kyle Broflovski?
[OTH],Ye-yes.
[OTH],I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
[OTH],Ye-yes.
[OTH],"Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you."
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],So open them.
[OTH],Oh! Phew.
[OTH],"Now, what seems to be the problem?"
[OTH],"Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack."
[OTH],AAGGGGGHHHH!!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
[OTH],"Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head."
[OTH],AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
[OTH],"...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled."
[OTH],Eewwww!
Cartman,"Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?"
[OTH],No. No-it looked dead.
[OTH],Eewwww!
[OTH],Wa-was it wearing clothes?
[OTH],"Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?"
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. Eeww."
[OTH],Eewwww!
[OTH],And then she walked over to--
[OTH],"Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called ""conjoined twin myslexia""."
Cartman,Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me...
[OTH],"Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys."
[OTH],"You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins."
[OTH],Gross!
[OTH],"But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached."
[OTH],"Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it!"
[OTH],AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
Cartman,AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
[OTH],"So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?"
[OTH],Uhhhh... Yeah.
[OTH],"Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?"
[OTH],Mm-hmm.
[OTH],"Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day..."
[OTH],Mm-hmm.
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother."
[OTH],"Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon."
[OTH],"Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?"
[OTH],No! I have to get it out!
[OTH],"Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia."
[OTH],So this is your fault.
[OTH],ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
[OTH],"Dammit, stop."
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],Dammit!
[OTH],"Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead?"
[OTH],That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
[OTH],Mm-hmm.
[OTH],"Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?"
Cartman,Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
[OTH],Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
[OTH],Awww...
[OTH],"Aw, do we have to?"
[OTH],Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
[OTH],"You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!"
Cartman,Heyh! They have a zoo there!
[OTH],"That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!"
[OTH],Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
[OTH],"Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?"
[OTH],I'd love to!
Cartman,"Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy."
[OTH],Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.
[OTH],"And besides, I hate French people."
[OTH],"Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?"
[OTH],Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
[OTH],O-of course you do.
[OTH],I want to talk to you all about your school nurse.
[OTH],"Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--"
[OTH],"No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of."
[OTH],"Oh, and uh, what disease is that?"
[OTH],"Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
[OTH],She does?
[OTH],Y-you never noticed that?
[OTH],"No-o, I never did."
[OTH],"Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!"
[OTH],"Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?"
[OTH],I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
[OTH],Do we have to eat kosher stuff?
[OTH],"Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8:00?"
[OTH],Wonderful!
[OTH],"Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?"
[OTH],"Okay children. Now, who's gonna win the State Finals?"
[OTH],Denver?
[OTH],"Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!"
[OTH],I think we need to get off on this exit.
[OTH],"SIT DOWN, KID!!"
[OTH],But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
[OTH],DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!
[OTH],"How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!"
[OTH],I SAID SIT DOOWWN!!!
[OTH],"Yes, ma'am."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, this is a school?"
[OTH],"Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars."
[OTH],"I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows."
[OTH],"Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are."
[OTH],"You're from South Park, yeah?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful."
[OTH],Play ball!
[OTH],"So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?"
[OTH],Colorado State.
[OTH],Ahhh.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?"
[OTH],"I mean, gravy."
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Dammit, come on!"
[OTH],Somebody catch the ball!
[OTH],"All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go!"
Cartman,"I caught it, I caught it!"
[OTH],"Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly!"
[OTH],South Park on offense!
[OTH],"Great job, children! Just stay focused now."
[OTH],"Go for it, Pip."
[OTH],"Oh, bother."
[OTH],"Come on, you Frenchy little frog!"
[OTH],Gagghh!
[OTH],"Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!"
[OTH],"Eh, sooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight."
[OTH],"Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!"
[OTH],Gerald!
[OTH],Keep your damn mouth shut!
[OTH],"I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really."
[OTH],"Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum."
[OTH],"No, I'm quite secure with it."
[OTH],I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
[OTH],They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
[OTH],Could I get some more pork?
[OTH],"So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?"
[OTH],"Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death."
[OTH],"Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?"
[OTH],"No, really, I don't need a--"
[OTH],"Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop."
[OTH],"I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person."
[OTH],I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
[OTH],"Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring."
[OTH],But I really don't think--
[OTH],"Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now!"
[OTH],"You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions."
Cartman,"Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap."
[OTH],"Get him, Frenchy!"
[OTH],Gaagghh!
[OTH],South Park wins!
[OTH],"We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!"
[OTH],Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee!
[OTH],It hur-hurts! Owieee!
[OTH],"Mommy, it huurts! I-it hur-hurts!"
[OTH],"Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!

Oooh, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals..."
[OTH],...where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.
[OTH],"But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!"
[OTH],"And now, let's kick off our week long festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!"
[OTH],Let's hear it for these brave souls!
[OTH],What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!
[OTH],"You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job."
[OTH],Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
[OTH],"How much further is Washington, D.C.?"
[OTH],"SIT DOWN, KID!!"
[OTH],"I need to know how far it is, lady!"
[OTH],I SAID SIT DOWN!!!
[OTH],"Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog."
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],"I said, ""I've always wanted to visit Prague."""
[OTH],"Oh, me too."
[OTH],"Okay, what have you got?"
[OTH],"Some hadka fish, some gafagga..."
Cartman,I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll!
[OTH],Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!
[OTH],Places!
[OTH],ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],(Sheesh!)
[OTH],"Damn, man. This is the big time, alright."
[OTH],"Chef, we're hungry."
[OTH],"You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese."
Cartman,My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Are you Chef?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions."
[OTH],"What? We did it! Children, we won!"
[OTH],"Wow, that was easy."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows!"
[OTH],"Hey, why did you guys forfeit?"
[OTH],You mean you don't know?
[OTH],Know what?
[OTH],Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.
[OTH],Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia!
[OTH],"They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals."
[OTH],"Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about."
[OTH],"Okay, children, back in the bus."
[OTH],"And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Oh, no..!"
[OTH],"You've got the strength, you've got the courage
Even with a dead fetus on your head
You carry on
You fight for tomorrow
Dead fetus or no, you never let go
You're my conjoined-twin-dead-thing-hanging-off-your-head woman"
[OTH],"Oh, that was so touching."
[OTH],"And now, friends, it's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is..."
[OTH],Nurse Gollum.
[OTH],Nurse Gollum!!
[OTH],"Oh, boy."
[OTH],"Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in."
[OTH],"Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China."
[OTH],"Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game."
[OTH],"But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!"
[OTH],"Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions."
[OTH],But we could get killed!
[OTH],And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?
[OTH],"Just imagine: a big yellow ""Dodgeball Champions"" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!"
[OTH],"Dude, Chef has lost it."
[OTH],"You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!"
Cartman,"So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?"
[OTH],"Dude, what does that mean?"
Cartman,I dunno.
[OTH],"Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?"
[OTH],"Yeah, you're from China."
[OTH],"No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese."
[OTH],Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
[OTH],"I have no idea, dude."
Cartman,"Come on, rice picker!"
[OTH],"Hey, hey hey!"
[OTH],"Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity."
[OTH],You don't?
[OTH],"But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people."
[OTH],"No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country."
[OTH],Ohhh.
Cartman,"Oooh, I get it."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],AAAGGGGHHHH!
[OTH],"Hiit ita wita great pride, that huwe huwelcome ourn American friend. Now let the..."
[OTH],...champion of dodgeball be deshide!
[OTH],"Damn, dude. China's fucked up."
[OTH],Take places!
[OTH],"All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!"
[OTH],"Okay, Tom, rooks rike A-mericans are getting ready to play. I don't suppose they'll have any problems seeing the ball with their big American eyes!"
[OTH],Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect.
[OTH],"Oh, you say such things."
[OTH],That's a zinger!
[OTH],Praaayyy braal!
[OTH],Holy crap..!
[OTH],Goddamn...
[OTH],"Hey, hey, what do you call white American person with PhD in a physics and-a math?"
[OTH],"Ah, I don't know. What?"
[OTH],Stupid American!
[OTH],"Aw, no way!!"
[OTH],"Oooh, another American is down! It's numbuh-- uuhhh... Oh, I don't know. All American look alike!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You... bastards...
[OTH],"Oooh, my, I haven't seen an American die like that since Abraham Lincoln!"
[OTH],"Dude, that is-a not cool! You're gonna get us into trouble again."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China."
[OTH],"Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats!"
[OTH],And there is-a only a one South Park prayer left.
[OTH],Still all Chinese prayer. This should be over veerry shortly.
[OTH],Come on! Throw ball!
[OTH],"Hey, you wanna hear my impersonation of American?"
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah!"
[OTH],"Ah, okay."
[OTH],"Hey, I really, really want that. That looks good."
[OTH],"Hey, hey. Let me try, let me try."
[OTH],I'll use my credit card.
[OTH],Eh-eh-uh... Do you have any non-dairy creamer?
[OTH],"Yes yes! Y'all come a-back now, you hear?"
[OTH],"Oh, what have I done?"
[OTH],"You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good."
[OTH],"If we had won the world championship, what then?"
[OTH],It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?"
[OTH],"Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home."
[OTH],Come on! Throw ball!
[OTH],"Hey, if you wanna make him throw the ball, say this."
[OTH],"Thanks, you American dumbass! ""You French piece of crap! Throw ball!"""
[OTH],"""What's the matter, Frenchy? You got crepes in your ears."""
[OTH],Arrggghhh!
[OTH],And the winner is South Park Cows!
[OTH],"Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day!"
[OTH],"Shut up, Pip."
[OTH],"Yeah, shut up, Pip. Can we go home now?"
[OTH],Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
[OTH],"Shut up, Pip!"
[OTH],"As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation."
[OTH],"Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows!"
[OTH],What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
[OTH],"And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!"
[OTH],Agghh!
[OTH],"Dude, it's the freak nurse!"
Cartman,Holy crap!
[OTH],"Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!"
[OTH],"Well sorry, dude, we weren't here."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week."
[OTH],She's really touched.
[OTH],"What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks!"
[OTH],"Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--"
[OTH],Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?
[OTH],"I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long."
[OTH],"Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other."
[OTH],And take those stupid things off your heads!
[OTH],"Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch."
[OTH],"Yeah, the nerve of some people."
[OTH],"Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool."
[OTH],"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter."
Cartman,I love you guys.
Cartman,"Ah, screw you guys!"
[OTH],"And now back to Huntin' and Killin'  with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!"
[OTH],"Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned."
[OTH],"M-hi, Ned."
[OTH],"Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?"
[OTH],"We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call ""Pussy Law #4"", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
""PUSSY LAW #4""
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE

BODILY HARM.

In other words, our old line of, ""It's comin' right for us""--"
[OTH],It's comin' right for us.
[OTH],"--no longer works. So now, we only kill animals to, quote, ""thin out their numbers"". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die."
[OTH],Uhh... So roll the tape.
[OTH],"Here we are at Schaefer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals."
[OTH],"Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!"
[OTH],"Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!"
[OTH],Thin out their numbers!
[OTH],"Good work, Ned. Now they won't starve."
[OTH],That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.
[OTH],Mmm-we're environmentalists.
[OTH],"Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species."
Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?"
[OTH],"""What's Vietnam?"" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war."
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?"
[OTH],Aaawwwgh... Aaawwwgh...
[OTH],"Come on, men! Let's go! Jump out of the chopper!"
[OTH],Who's next to take a shower?
[OTH],Me-ee!
[OTH],I am.
[OTH],"You just took one last week, silly."
[OTH],"Oh, where can I hide this big pipe?"
[OTH],"No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper."
[OTH],Awww..!
Cartman,Son of a bitch.
[OTH],I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.
[OTH],What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?
[OTH],"Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam."
[OTH],"Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show."
[OTH],"And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained."
[OTH],"One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist."
[OTH],"Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog."
[OTH],"There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!"
[OTH],"Now, freeze it!"
[OTH],"Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?"
[OTH],"M-whoa, I'm scared."
[OTH],"Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...

We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed"
[OTH],Mm-good night.
[OTH],"A-and we're cut. Great show, guys."
[OTH],"Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley."
[OTH],"So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?"
[OTH],No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
[OTH],"Oh. Yeah, we sure were."
Cartman,Was it fun?
[OTH],Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
[OTH],"Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Yepper, that's where me and Ned met."
[OTH],I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.
[OTH],"Oh, boy, what a gorgeous day!"
[OTH],"Kern, get over here! The new privates are here. I'm assigning one of them to you as a trainee. Ned Gerblansky."
[OTH],"Ned Gerblansky reporting, sir."
[OTH],"Thanks, Ned. Now, the bad guys have been spotted about ten klicks north of here. I know that you and Kern are best suited to take them out. Are you up for it?"
[OTH],"Sir, yes, sir!"
[OTH],Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.
[OTH],"Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?"
[OTH],Certainly. And would you like another muffin as well?
[OTH],Why the hell not? We're at war.
[OTH],"Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat."
[OTH],"No, that's all lies. I'll be fine. Charlies at 2 o'clock!"
[OTH],I see 'em! Drop the bomb!
[OTH],The bomb's not releasing!
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],It won't budge.
[OTH],Then we only have one option.
[OTH],"What are you doing, man?!"
[OTH],"We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards!"
[OTH],Yaaarrrggghhh!!!
[OTH],Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!
[OTH],"We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!"
[OTH],Whoopie.
[OTH],Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes!
[OTH],"And that's the way it happened, boys."
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,"Man, Vietnam was sweet!"
[OTH],"Great news, guys. Your TV show ratings have doubled!"
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],They've gone from six people to twelve.
[OTH],Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy!
[OTH],"We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show."
[OTH],But I don't really care about that.
[OTH],"Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times."
[OTH],"Ohh, alright."
[OTH],"Alright, we're ten second to air, guys."
[OTH],"Remember, big, big, big!."
[OTH],"And five, four, three..."
[OTH],"It's your hour of power on midday Mountain Cable Access. Put your hands together and welcome the only man in town who always has a fully-stocked wine cellar, Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-sus Christ!"
[OTH],Uhhh... Hi.
[OTH],"Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction."
[OTH],"We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver."
[OTH],Here's  Booooobbb Denver.
[OTH],"Hi, Bob Denver."
[OTH],"Hi, Jesus. Great to be here."
[OTH],"So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?"
[OTH],Yup. Just got in.
[OTH],"So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?"
[OTH],Nn-nothing. Nothing really at all.
[OTH],"'Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You gotta have something"
[OTH],Oh boy.
[OTH],"""...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp."""
[OTH],"""Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster."""
[OTH],"""...and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride."""
[OTH],"""So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end."
[OTH],The end.
[OTH],Are there any questions?
[OTH],"Yes, Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],Yes. Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit?
[OTH],From Vietnam veterans.
[OTH],"Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie."
[OTH],"No, no, we didn't--"
[OTH],You all receive an F...minus.
[OTH],F-minus? Can he do that?
[OTH],"Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--"
[OTH],"Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides."
[OTH],How do you know? You weren't even there.
[OTH],"Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!"
[OTH],Aawwww!
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. It's important for you all to know why you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it."
Cartman,"You're dead, Stan."
[OTH],"For what, dude?"
[OTH],"(Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!)"
[OTH],"You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?"
Cartman,"Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week."
[OTH],"Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!"
[OTH],Shh! M'kay?
[OTH],Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
Cartman,"Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!"
[OTH],Shh! M'kay?
[OTH],"We've got to get him back, dude."
Cartman,Totally.
[OTH],How?
[OTH],"Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing."
[OTH],"Well, what do you mean?"
[OTH],Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy...
Cartman,"Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!"
[OTH],"And now back to Huntin' and Killin'  with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!"
[OTH],"Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park."
[OTH],Aggghhh!
[OTH],"Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away."
[OTH],"Okay, roll the film, Tom."
[OTH],"Is it over? Okay, it's over."
[OTH],"Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists."
[OTH],"And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show."
[OTH],"Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!"
[OTH],"Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses."
[OTH],"(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.)"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Come on! We've gotta make another one!
Cartman,Lying kicks ass!
[OTH],Jesus!
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!
[OTH],"Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?"
[OTH],"I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further."
[OTH],"And we're back in five, four, three..."
[OTH],"Remember, big, big, big!"
[OTH],"If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle."
[OTH],"Well, as I was saying, I tried and tried, but my overturned car just won't budge. My husband was trapped for twelve hours."
[OTH],"And yet, somehow, he managed to survive."
[OTH],"That's right. He's a very brave man, and I love him very much."
[OTH],"I love you, too."
[OTH],"W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions."
[OTH],"Yes, uhh, you over there."
[OTH],"I think she needs to kick him to the curb, baby!"
[OTH],Kick who to the curb?
[OTH],Her no-good husband! She's got to lose that zero and get herself a hero!
[OTH],But--
[OTH],"He wants to have his cake and eat it, too. He's got to dump that trash girlfriend."
[OTH],It's all about respect. You've gotta have respect for yourself.
[OTH],Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.
[OTH],"Yes, your comments."
[OTH],"Montel, I think we're forgetting something very important in all of this. Okay, sure, he touched some children, but the man is a great singer and he has entertained us for so many years."
[OTH],Wha-what are you talking about?
[OTH],"Michael Jackson. All this baad-mouthin' and puttin' the man down. Maybe he did touch some children now and then, but come on! It's Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson!"
[OTH],"Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages."
[OTH],"Ready, you guys?"
Cartman,Ready.
[OTH],Okay. Action!
Cartman,Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
[OTH],Cut! Cartman!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],It's supposed to be a frog!
Cartman,I know that!
[OTH],"Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?"
Cartman,It's a Sri Lanka frog!
[OTH],"Der, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Der yourself, hippie!"
[OTH],"Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk!"
[OTH],"Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?"
Cartman,"I'm ready, Steven Spielberg!"
[OTH],Action!
Cartman,Blulululuh. Screw you guys.
Cartman,"Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?"
[OTH],"'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!"
Cartman,Ee-goddammit!
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you."
Cartman,They better not!
[OTH],"Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way, then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared."
Cartman,Scared of a plastic frog?
[OTH],"It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?"
Cartman,"Man, this is stupid."
[OTH],Good. A-and action!
Cartman,Eee-ee-ee-ee!
[OTH],"Well, it appears as though a lot of you ""skeptics"" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer. Roll it!"
[OTH],"There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!"
[OTH],Mmmm-damn that frog.
[OTH],"Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--"
[OTH],"--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?"
[OTH],"Ooh, no, no, no, no!"
[OTH],"This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!"
[OTH],"Uhhh, clever?"
[OTH],"It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless..."
[OTH],Unless what?
[OTH],"Unless we can prove to the City world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!"
[OTH],"Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again."
[OTH],"Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes."
[OTH],What video tapes?
[OTH],"Yea, children. I am the way and the light..."
[OTH],You've seen Jesus and Pals. Now you've got to get the video!
[OTH],Things get a little out of control!
[OTH],You won't believe your eyes!
[OTH],"Order now, only $19.95!"
[OTH],"Remember, this is stuff you can't see on TV!"
[OTH],Anonymous tip?
[OTH],"Yeah, it was left on our answering machine. All it said was that they saw the Mexican staring frog just south of Stark's Pond this morning."
[OTH],"Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?"
[OTH],You were in 'Nam? Where were you stationed?
[OTH],Mmm-Da Nang.
[OTH],With the log ride?
[OTH],Yep.
[OTH],"Man, I was in Tet. We had a bad-ass roller coaster, but... all we ever wanted was a log ride. We waited and we waited, but... they never built us one. I think..Danforth wanted the log ride more than anybody, but he... he had to settle with that lame dinosaur water adventure ride."
[OTH],That war was hell on everybody.
[OTH],"Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!"
[OTH],Wow! Do we got more money?
[OTH],"No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!"
[OTH],"Dude, they're gonna look so stupid."
Cartman,"Dude, totally."
[OTH],"They deserve it for lying to us, dude."
Cartman,"Revenge is so very, very sweet."
[OTH],They're here! Hurry and hide!
[OTH],Let's hunt!
[OTH],We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--
[OTH],"Mm-Jimbo, look!"
[OTH],Hit the deck!
[OTH],What is it?
[OTH],It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.
[OTH],He is?
[OTH],Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!
[OTH],"Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you."
[OTH],Mm-roger that.
[OTH],"Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today."
[OTH],The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.
[OTH],"We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device, while Ned will ambush him from the rear."
[OTH],"Now, Ned! He's not looking!"
[OTH],"Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!"
[OTH],Ned. Ne-ed?
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!"
[OTH],"Come back to me, buddy."
[OTH],You getting all this?
[OTH],Hold onto your butts.
[OTH],"Take that, you demon frog!"
[OTH],"Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?"
[OTH],"Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!"
[OTH],Get the Flight for Life helicopter!
[OTH],"Holy crap, dude."
[OTH],"...""but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'"""
[OTH],"Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself."
[OTH],"Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!"
[OTH],"Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!"
[OTH],Look!
[OTH],Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
[OTH],"Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!"
[OTH],What..?
[OTH],We shot all those videos and sent them in.
[OTH],"Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke!"
[OTH],You sent in those videos?!
[OTH],"Oh, this is not good."
[OTH],"My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!"
[OTH],"Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'."
[OTH],You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
[OTH],It's a psychosomatic response. I couldn't help overhearing your conversation just now.
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"I produce a little TV show called Jesus and Pals, you might have heard of it. Your story is amazing; full of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing and bitterness."
[OTH],Uhhhh... Thanks?
[OTH],How would you like to share your remarkable story with us on tomorrow's show?
[OTH],"We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?"
[OTH],"That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting."
[OTH],"Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!"
[OTH],"Is that true, Stan?"
[OTH],It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
[OTH],"Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return."
[OTH],A-and we're out.
[OTH],You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],"Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan."
[OTH],Satan. Got it.
[OTH],"Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!"
[OTH],"Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!"
[OTH],And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
Cartman,Dibs!
[OTH],"Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue."
[OTH],Roger.
[OTH],"Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?"
[OTH],I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!
[OTH],Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!
[OTH],"Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you."
[OTH],"Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me."
[OTH],"Why, you little piece of crap!"
[OTH],You big piece of crap!
Cartman,That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!
Cartman,"Take that, hippie!"
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],Jeesus! Jeesus!
[OTH],"O-okay, okay, that's enough."
[OTH],"Take that, you asshole!"
[OTH],What the fuck was that?
[OTH],"Uh, let's watch the language, people."
[OTH],"Bring it on, you bitch!"
Cartman,"Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!"
[OTH],Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!
[OTH],Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
[OTH],(Nononono-yikes!)
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah, yeh..."
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah, yeh-oh?"
[OTH],"Oh, Oh! Aah! AAAAGGHH!!! Ooh.. Ew"
[OTH],"(OW! OW! DUDE, PLEASE STOP!! OH, FUCK! YIKES!!!!!)"
[OTH],"Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
Cartman,"Ey, you guys!"
[OTH],Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
[OTH],"Oh, my God!"
[OTH],Shut the fuck up!
[OTH],"Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused."
[OTH],"W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble."
[OTH],"Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened."
[OTH],Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
[OTH],The entire Vietcong Army?
[OTH],"I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different."
[OTH],Is it?
[OTH],"Well, sure. I mean, eh... Well, no uh, I guess not."
[OTH],"And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--"
[OTH],"Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!"
[OTH],Wait. Jimbo made that up?
[OTH],"No, your producer did."
[OTH],She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!"
[OTH],"It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool."
[OTH],"Oh, really?"
[OTH],Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
Cartman,"Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that."
[OTH],Screw this show. I thought this was all real.
[OTH],"W-wait, everybody. Come back."
[OTH],"Don't feel too bad, Montel. We all want to touch children sometimes; it's only natural."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble."
[OTH],"W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world."
[OTH],Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
[OTH],"Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned?"
[OTH],I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.
[OTH],Yeah. Titties and beer.
[OTH],"Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--"
[OTH],Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
[OTH],I sent her away.
Cartman,Sent her away where?
[OTH],What is this? What's happening?!
[OTH],Welcome to my dominion.
[OTH],Oooooohhhh!
[OTH],"Hey. Take a load off. Put your feet up. Me and Satan were just aboot to go shopping for furniture. Come on, Satan."
[OTH],"Okay, honey."
[OTH],Noooooo!
[OTH],"And now back to Huntin' and Killin'  with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!"
[OTH],"Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned."
[OTH],"M-hi, Ned."
[OTH],"Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?"
[OTH],"We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call ""Pussy Law #4"", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
""PUSSY LAW #4""
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE

BODILY HARM.

In other words, our old line of, ""It's comin' right for us""--"
[OTH],It's comin' right for us.
[OTH],"--no longer works. So now, we only kill animals to, quote, ""thin out their numbers"". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die."
[OTH],Uhh... So roll the tape.
[OTH],"Here we are at Schaefer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals."
[OTH],"Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!"
[OTH],"Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!"
[OTH],Thin out their numbers!
[OTH],"Good work, Ned. Now they won't starve."
[OTH],That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.
[OTH],Mmm-we're environmentalists.
[OTH],"Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species."
Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?"
[OTH],"""What's Vietnam?"" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war."
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?"
[OTH],Aaawwwgh... Aaawwwgh...
[OTH],"Come on, men! Let's go! Jump out of the chopper!"
[OTH],Who's next to take a shower?
[OTH],Me-ee!
[OTH],I am.
[OTH],"You just took one last week, silly."
[OTH],"Oh, where can I hide this big pipe?"
[OTH],"No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper."
[OTH],Awww..!
Cartman,Son of a bitch.
[OTH],I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.
[OTH],What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?
[OTH],"Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam."
[OTH],"Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show."
[OTH],"And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained."
[OTH],"One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist."
[OTH],"Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog."
[OTH],"There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!"
[OTH],"Now, freeze it!"
[OTH],"Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?"
[OTH],"M-whoa, I'm scared."
[OTH],"Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...

We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed"
[OTH],Mm-good night.
[OTH],"A-and we're cut. Great show, guys."
[OTH],"Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley."
[OTH],"So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?"
[OTH],No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
[OTH],"Oh. Yeah, we sure were."
Cartman,Was it fun?
[OTH],Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
[OTH],"Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Yepper, that's where me and Ned met."
[OTH],I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.
[OTH],"Oh, boy, what a gorgeous day!"
[OTH],"Kern, get over here! The new privates are here. I'm assigning one of them to you as a trainee. Ned Gerblansky."
[OTH],"Ned Gerblansky reporting, sir."
[OTH],"Thanks, Ned. Now, the bad guys have been spotted about ten klicks north of here. I know that you and Kern are best suited to take them out. Are you up for it?"
[OTH],"Sir, yes, sir!"
[OTH],Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.
[OTH],"Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?"
[OTH],Certainly. And would you like another muffin as well?
[OTH],Why the hell not? We're at war.
[OTH],"Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat."
[OTH],"No, that's all lies. I'll be fine. Charlies at 2 o'clock!"
[OTH],I see 'em! Drop the bomb!
[OTH],The bomb's not releasing!
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],It won't budge.
[OTH],Then we only have one option.
[OTH],"What are you doing, man?!"
[OTH],"We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards!"
[OTH],Yaaarrrggghhh!!!
[OTH],Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!
[OTH],"We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!"
[OTH],Whoopie.
[OTH],Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes!
[OTH],"And that's the way it happened, boys."
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,"Man, Vietnam was sweet!"
[OTH],"Great news, guys. Your TV show ratings have doubled!"
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],They've gone from six people to twelve.
[OTH],Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy!
[OTH],"We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show."
[OTH],But I don't really care about that.
[OTH],"Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times."
[OTH],"Ohh, alright."
[OTH],"Alright, we're ten second to air, guys."
[OTH],"Remember, big, big, big!."
[OTH],"And five, four, three..."
[OTH],"It's your hour of power on midday Mountain Cable Access. Put your hands together and welcome the only man in town who always has a fully-stocked wine cellar, Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-sus Christ!"
[OTH],Uhhh... Hi.
[OTH],"Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction."
[OTH],"We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver."
[OTH],Here's  Booooobbb Denver.
[OTH],"Hi, Bob Denver."
[OTH],"Hi, Jesus. Great to be here."
[OTH],"So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?"
[OTH],Yup. Just got in.
[OTH],"So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?"
[OTH],Nn-nothing. Nothing really at all.
[OTH],"'Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You gotta have something"
[OTH],Oh boy.
[OTH],"""...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp."""
[OTH],"""Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster."""
[OTH],"""...and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride."""
[OTH],"""So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end."
[OTH],The end.
[OTH],Are there any questions?
[OTH],"Yes, Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],Yes. Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit?
[OTH],From Vietnam veterans.
[OTH],"Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie."
[OTH],"No, no, we didn't--"
[OTH],You all receive an F...minus.
[OTH],F-minus? Can he do that?
[OTH],"Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--"
[OTH],"Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides."
[OTH],How do you know? You weren't even there.
[OTH],"Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!"
[OTH],Aawwww!
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. It's important for you all to know why you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it."
Cartman,"You're dead, Stan."
[OTH],"For what, dude?"
[OTH],"(Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!)"
[OTH],"You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?"
Cartman,"Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week."
[OTH],"Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!"
[OTH],Shh! M'kay?
[OTH],Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
Cartman,"Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!"
[OTH],Shh! M'kay?
[OTH],"We've got to get him back, dude."
Cartman,Totally.
[OTH],How?
[OTH],"Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing."
[OTH],"Well, what do you mean?"
[OTH],Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy...
Cartman,"Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!"
[OTH],"And now back to Huntin' and Killin'  with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!"
[OTH],"Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park."
[OTH],Aggghhh!
[OTH],"Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away."
[OTH],"Okay, roll the film, Tom."
[OTH],"Is it over? Okay, it's over."
[OTH],"Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists."
[OTH],"And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show."
[OTH],"Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!"
[OTH],"Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses."
[OTH],"(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.)"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Come on! We've gotta make another one!
Cartman,Lying kicks ass!
[OTH],Jesus!
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!
[OTH],"Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?"
[OTH],"I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further."
[OTH],"And we're back in five, four, three..."
[OTH],"Remember, big, big, big!"
[OTH],"If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle."
[OTH],"Well, as I was saying, I tried and tried, but my overturned car just won't budge. My husband was trapped for twelve hours."
[OTH],"And yet, somehow, he managed to survive."
[OTH],"That's right. He's a very brave man, and I love him very much."
[OTH],"I love you, too."
[OTH],"W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions."
[OTH],"Yes, uhh, you over there."
[OTH],"I think she needs to kick him to the curb, baby!"
[OTH],Kick who to the curb?
[OTH],Her no-good husband! She's got to lose that zero and get herself a hero!
[OTH],But--
[OTH],"He wants to have his cake and eat it, too. He's got to dump that trash girlfriend."
[OTH],It's all about respect. You've gotta have respect for yourself.
[OTH],Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.
[OTH],"Yes, your comments."
[OTH],"Montel, I think we're forgetting something very important in all of this. Okay, sure, he touched some children, but the man is a great singer and he has entertained us for so many years."
[OTH],Wha-what are you talking about?
[OTH],"Michael Jackson. All this baad-mouthin' and puttin' the man down. Maybe he did touch some children now and then, but come on! It's Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson!"
[OTH],"Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages."
[OTH],"Ready, you guys?"
Cartman,Ready.
[OTH],Okay. Action!
Cartman,Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
[OTH],Cut! Cartman!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],It's supposed to be a frog!
Cartman,I know that!
[OTH],"Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?"
Cartman,It's a Sri Lanka frog!
[OTH],"Der, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Der yourself, hippie!"
[OTH],"Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk!"
[OTH],"Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?"
Cartman,"I'm ready, Steven Spielberg!"
[OTH],Action!
Cartman,Blulululuh. Screw you guys.
Cartman,"Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?"
[OTH],"'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!"
Cartman,Ee-goddammit!
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you."
Cartman,They better not!
[OTH],"Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way, then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared."
Cartman,Scared of a plastic frog?
[OTH],"It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?"
Cartman,"Man, this is stupid."
[OTH],Good. A-and action!
Cartman,Eee-ee-ee-ee!
[OTH],"Well, it appears as though a lot of you ""skeptics"" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer. Roll it!"
[OTH],"There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!"
[OTH],Mmmm-damn that frog.
[OTH],"Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--"
[OTH],"--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?"
[OTH],"Ooh, no, no, no, no!"
[OTH],"This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!"
[OTH],"Uhhh, clever?"
[OTH],"It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless..."
[OTH],Unless what?
[OTH],"Unless we can prove to the City world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!"
[OTH],"Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again."
[OTH],"Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes."
[OTH],What video tapes?
[OTH],"Yea, children. I am the way and the light..."
[OTH],You've seen Jesus and Pals. Now you've got to get the video!
[OTH],Things get a little out of control!
[OTH],You won't believe your eyes!
[OTH],"Order now, only $19.95!"
[OTH],"Remember, this is stuff you can't see on TV!"
[OTH],Anonymous tip?
[OTH],"Yeah, it was left on our answering machine. All it said was that they saw the Mexican staring frog just south of Stark's Pond this morning."
[OTH],"Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?"
[OTH],You were in 'Nam? Where were you stationed?
[OTH],Mmm-Da Nang.
[OTH],With the log ride?
[OTH],Yep.
[OTH],"Man, I was in Tet. We had a bad-ass roller coaster, but... all we ever wanted was a log ride. We waited and we waited, but... they never built us one. I think..Danforth wanted the log ride more than anybody, but he... he had to settle with that lame dinosaur water adventure ride."
[OTH],That war was hell on everybody.
[OTH],"Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!"
[OTH],Wow! Do we got more money?
[OTH],"No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!"
[OTH],"Dude, they're gonna look so stupid."
Cartman,"Dude, totally."
[OTH],"They deserve it for lying to us, dude."
Cartman,"Revenge is so very, very sweet."
[OTH],They're here! Hurry and hide!
[OTH],Let's hunt!
[OTH],We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--
[OTH],"Mm-Jimbo, look!"
[OTH],Hit the deck!
[OTH],What is it?
[OTH],It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.
[OTH],He is?
[OTH],Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!
[OTH],"Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you."
[OTH],Mm-roger that.
[OTH],"Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today."
[OTH],The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.
[OTH],"We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device, while Ned will ambush him from the rear."
[OTH],"Now, Ned! He's not looking!"
[OTH],"Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!"
[OTH],Ned. Ne-ed?
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!"
[OTH],"Come back to me, buddy."
[OTH],You getting all this?
[OTH],Hold onto your butts.
[OTH],"Take that, you demon frog!"
[OTH],"Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?"
[OTH],"Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!"
[OTH],Get the Flight for Life helicopter!
[OTH],"Holy crap, dude."
[OTH],"...""but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'"""
[OTH],"Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself."
[OTH],"Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!"
[OTH],"Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!"
[OTH],Look!
[OTH],Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
[OTH],"Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!"
[OTH],What..?
[OTH],We shot all those videos and sent them in.
[OTH],"Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke!"
[OTH],You sent in those videos?!
[OTH],"Oh, this is not good."
[OTH],"My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!"
[OTH],"Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'."
[OTH],You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
[OTH],It's a psychosomatic response. I couldn't help overhearing your conversation just now.
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"I produce a little TV show called Jesus and Pals, you might have heard of it. Your story is amazing; full of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing and bitterness."
[OTH],Uhhhh... Thanks?
[OTH],How would you like to share your remarkable story with us on tomorrow's show?
[OTH],"We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?"
[OTH],"That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting."
[OTH],"Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!"
[OTH],"Is that true, Stan?"
[OTH],It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
[OTH],"Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return."
[OTH],A-and we're out.
[OTH],You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],"Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan."
[OTH],Satan. Got it.
[OTH],"Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!"
[OTH],"Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!"
[OTH],And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
Cartman,Dibs!
[OTH],"Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue."
[OTH],Roger.
[OTH],"Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?"
[OTH],I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!
[OTH],Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!
[OTH],"Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you."
[OTH],"Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me."
[OTH],"Why, you little piece of crap!"
[OTH],You big piece of crap!
Cartman,That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!
Cartman,"Take that, hippie!"
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],Jeesus! Jeesus!
[OTH],"O-okay, okay, that's enough."
[OTH],"Take that, you asshole!"
[OTH],What the fuck was that?
[OTH],"Uh, let's watch the language, people."
[OTH],"Bring it on, you bitch!"
Cartman,"Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!"
[OTH],Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!
[OTH],Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
[OTH],(Nononono-yikes!)
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah, yeh..."
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah, yeh-oh?"
[OTH],"Oh, Oh! Aah! AAAAGGHH!!! Ooh.. Ew"
[OTH],"(OW! OW! DUDE, PLEASE STOP!! OH, FUCK! YIKES!!!!!)"
[OTH],"Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
Cartman,"Ey, you guys!"
[OTH],Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
[OTH],"Oh, my God!"
[OTH],Shut the fuck up!
[OTH],"Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused."
[OTH],"W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble."
[OTH],"Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened."
[OTH],Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
[OTH],The entire Vietcong Army?
[OTH],"I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different."
[OTH],Is it?
[OTH],"Well, sure. I mean, eh... Well, no uh, I guess not."
[OTH],"And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--"
[OTH],"Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!"
[OTH],Wait. Jimbo made that up?
[OTH],"No, your producer did."
[OTH],She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!"
[OTH],"It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool."
[OTH],"Oh, really?"
[OTH],Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
Cartman,"Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that."
[OTH],Screw this show. I thought this was all real.
[OTH],"W-wait, everybody. Come back."
[OTH],"Don't feel too bad, Montel. We all want to touch children sometimes; it's only natural."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble."
[OTH],"W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world."
[OTH],Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
[OTH],"Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned?"
[OTH],I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.
[OTH],Yeah. Titties and beer.
[OTH],"Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--"
[OTH],Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
[OTH],I sent her away.
Cartman,Sent her away where?
[OTH],What is this? What's happening?!
[OTH],Welcome to my dominion.
[OTH],Oooooohhhh!
[OTH],"Hey. Take a load off. Put your feet up. Me and Satan were just aboot to go shopping for furniture. Come on, Satan."
[OTH],"Okay, honey."
[OTH],Noooooo!
[OTH],BE QUIET BACK THERRE! THESE ROADS ARE SLIICK!
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman!"
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Cartman,"Hmmm, let me see. No!"
[OTH],"Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!"
Cartman,Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
[OTH],"Give us some, Cartman!"
[OTH],BE QUIET BACK THERRE!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there."
[OTH],"Dude, the road is always snowy."
[OTH],"I know, but, it's really snowy today."
Cartman,"Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Okay, that does it! Y'all be quiet or the cute little bunny dies!"
[OTH],"Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would."
[OTH],"Oh, she would, dude. She would."
[OTH],GOODD!
[OTH],"OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!"
[OTH],"Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now."
Cartman,"I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try."
[OTH],"Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!"
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],Whoa oh.
[OTH],Hold oonn! Aaaaa!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],I'm scared!
[OTH],"BE QUIET, KID!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They're indigenous to this area.
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],What was what?
[OTH],Aaaah-
Cartman,All done!
[OTH],SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!
[OTH],"I SAID 'QUIET,' OR ELSE I KILL THE BUNNY!"
[OTH],Where are we?
[OTH],I have no idea.
[OTH],I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
[OTH],"Yeah, what are we supposed to do?"
[OTH],Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual.
Cartman,Ms. Crabtree?
[OTH],"SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!"
[OTH],"Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.'"
[OTH],"KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!"
[OTH],"That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'"
[OTH],"I'm goin' for help. Ah'll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don't get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!"
[OTH],"Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat her?"
[OTH],"'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!"
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],"I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on."
[OTH],"Had to happen to me, didn't it?"
[OTH],"Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too-"
[OTH],"Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa."
[OTH],"Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way?"
[OTH],SHUT UP AND HELP ME INTO THIS THIING!
[OTH],Whoa. Hehum huh.
[OTH],Yeah! COME ON! I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY!
[OTH],"Uh huh. Alright, sure, of course."
[OTH],"TAKE ME TO THE NEAREST TOWN AND MAKE IT SNAPPY, YOU FREAK-ASS CRACKPOT!"
[OTH],"Uuuh, yeh, yes ma'am. Righta right away, ma'am.}"
[OTH],"So uh... Uhwhat's a- fragile little doe like yourself doin' out on a, on a night like this?"
[OTH],"LOOK, MISTER, I GOT A BUSLOAD OF KIDS TRAPPED UP ON THAT PASS! I NEED A CRANE, HELICOPTERS, ALL THAT CRAP! HERE, LET ME HAVE SOME O' YOUR ASPIRIN!"
[OTH],"Uh uh- ma'am, those are actually roofies."
[OTH],"ROOFIES, ASPIRIN, RIGHT NOW I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS!"
[OTH],HOW FAR TO THE NEAREST TOOWWN?!
[OTH],Mm-... mm-it's a ways.
Cartman,"You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever."
[OTH],What? Huh?
[OTH],"We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days."
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],What?
Cartman,I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes! You guys suck!
[OTH],Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
[OTH],Worse than this?
[OTH],"Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary."
Cartman,"Oh, man, this sucks."
[OTH],How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
[OTH],I think we have to signal them somehow.
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"Hey, he's like Rudolph."
[OTH],"Yeah. All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!"
Cartman,"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight."
[OTH],Sure you do!
[OTH],"Come on Cartman, fart!"
Cartman,I don't wanna.
[OTH],He can't hold it in forever.
[OTH],"Fart, damn you!"
Cartman,"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!"
[OTH],"Whoa, look at that."
Cartman,It's completely immature!
[OTH],"Hey, it's happening again."
[OTH],"It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?"
Cartman,You guys can't scare me!
[OTH],"Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass."
[OTH],"Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream."
[OTH],Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay.
[OTH],Mmmm.
[OTH],"Now, that was what I call a sticky situation."
[OTH],You can say that again.
Cartman,Was that how it happened?
[OTH],"STOOPP! LET ME OFF, YOU TURD!"
[OTH],"Hey. Uh I wanna help you. Uh, I care a lot about that bus full of uuh- what was it again?"
[OTH],Children.
[OTH],"Yeah right. Leh, let me come with you."
[OTH],WHO- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAAP?!
[OTH],"I hate flyin'. Talk about somethin' I hate, it's flyin'."
[OTH],"Say uuhh, are those roofies kickin' in yet?"
[OTH],"WELL, I DON'T THINK SO!"
[OTH],Damn!
[OTH],D'you guys like impressions?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],Here's my impression of Robert De Niro.
[OTH],"Hey, youse. Youse guys. Shut up, youse!"
[OTH],YOU SUUCK!!
[OTH],"Youse guys, shut up!"
[OTH],SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!
[OTH],"Come on, lady. Iii love you. You love me."
[OTH],"I SAAIID, SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!"
[OTH],"Baby, you're wonderful! You're a natural! You're the funniest comic I've seen in yeauhs!"
[OTH],WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP. I'VE GOT TO GET SOME ASSISTANCE FOR MY BROKEN-DOWN BUUSS!!
[OTH],Broken-down bus! That's great! Great angle!
[OTH],Do you see 'er dude?
[OTH],Nope.
Cartman,"God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?"
[OTH],She's never coming back. Don't you get it? She left us here to die like pigs.
[OTH],"Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny."
[OTH],(Huh?)
[OTH],I can't take it anymore! I have to get out of here!
[OTH],"No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!"
[OTH],"Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help."
[OTH],"Don't do it, kid."
[OTH],Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
[OTH],Nooooo-agh!
[OTH],"Holy crap, dude!"
[OTH],Gross!
[OTH],"Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother."
[OTH],"Oh yes, Sharon. How are you?"
[OTH],"Ms. Cartman, is your son at home?"
[OTH],"Hu-old on, dear, let me check."
[OTH],"Hon, I made beefy logs."
[OTH],I made Cookie Dings.
[OTH],"No, he's not here."
[OTH],"Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are."
[OTH],"Oh, dear!"
[OTH],"I'm telling you, Marty, this woman is a natural! I haven't seen a funnier person since Maury Povich."
[OTH],What's her angle?
[OTH],I can't even explain it. You have to see it.
[OTH],"Alright. Well, this better be good."
[OTH],"Come on in, come on in."
[OTH],"WHUAT THE HELL DID YOU BRING ME TO DENVER FOR, YOU BRAIN-DEPRAVED FECOPHILIAC?!"
[OTH],"Mr. Jonus, this is Mrs. Crabtree."
[OTH],Pleasure to meet you.
[OTH],YOU LOOK LIKE A LUMP OF DOGSHIT JUST GOT HIT BY A CAR!!
[OTH],What did I tell you?
[OTH],"She's fantastic. How would you like to make a million dollars, baby?"
[OTH],HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY ASS?!
[OTH],Let's get started right away.
[OTH],Are you gonna be all right?
[OTH],DON'T TOUCH ME!
[OTH],Uh ah-I'm sorry. Do you need anything?
[OTH],No. I just...
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I can't help but feel that I've forgotten somethin'.
[OTH],What time is it?
[OTH],(Almost 7:30.)
[OTH],On Wednesday or Thursday?
[OTH],"Dude, I think it's Saturday now."
Cartman,What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
[OTH],"Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus."
[OTH],"Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us."
Cartman,What do you think it is?
[OTH],"I don't know, it's- a big scary monster."
[OTH],"Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
[OTH],Aaaaaa!
[OTH],The lava's comin' right for us!
Cartman,Heellp!
[OTH],"Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!"
Cartman,What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
[OTH],Oh my God! Look at his leg!
[OTH],"Hi kids, I'm TV's Brent Musberger."
[OTH],Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
[OTH],Aaaa!
[OTH],"Quick Ned, shoot it!"
[OTH],"Mmm. Oh no, out of ammo."
[OTH],"Hey, look!"
[OTH],Grrrr.
[OTH],Dude! He's making ice cream.
Cartman,Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!
[OTH],"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation."
[OTH],"Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice."
Cartman,"Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!"
Cartman,"Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?"
[OTH],Here she comes!
[OTH],Come on you little bitch.
[OTH],It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, stop!"
[OTH],Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
[OTH],But Mr. Garrison!
[OTH],She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien.
[OTH],Thank you. And I love you all.
[OTH],Naawwr!
[OTH],"See, I told ya."
[OTH],Mmmm.
[OTH],"Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day. Let's have ice cream, everyone!"
Cartman,Beefcaake!
Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation."
[OTH],"But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun."
Cartman,"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],"Live from Burbank, it's The Tonight Show, with Jay Leno. Tonight, Jay's special guests include: Washed-up Actress from a sitcom. And the comedy of Mrs. Crabtree. And now, here's your host, Jay Leno."
[OTH],"Just relax, sweetheart, you're gonna kill out there."
[OTH],KILL WHO?!
[OTH],Huh that's great. Use that.
[OTH],"Honey du-, do you need anything?"
[OTH],JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE OF THEM ROOFIES.
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Oh oh okay? Let's try to calm down, n'kay? This type of thing happens all the time."
[OTH],What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!
[OTH],"Well, 99% of the time, when a child is missing, it's because they've run away. M'kay?"
[OTH],Run away?
[OTH],"Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah."
[OTH],How do we get our runaway children back?
[OTH],"Well, we just need to make some posters, nkay? Hand out brochures, onkay? That way, the public can know what the chldren look like and can call in if thry're spotted, m'kay?"
[OTH],Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.
[OTH],It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.
[OTH],"Come on, everybody!"
[OTH],We've got to find those kids!
[OTH],"If we all put our heads together, we can find them!"
[OTH],We can do it!
[OTH],Hi.
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],What was what?
[OTH],"Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!"
[OTH],What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
[OTH],(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
[OTH],"Hey yeah, I remember that."
[OTH],"(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)"
[OTH],Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
[OTH],Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
[OTH],Come over here you son of a whore!
[OTH],(Take... that!)
[OTH],"(You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!)"
[OTH],Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
[OTH],You... bastard?
[OTH],(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!)
[OTH],"Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you."
[OTH],"(Oh, yeah.)"
[OTH],"Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right?"
[OTH],AAAAH!
[OTH],MOMMY!
[OTH],"(Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!)"
[OTH],"Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],"Hoh boy, we're in big trouble."
Cartman,Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
[OTH],WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ALL STARIN' AT?!
[OTH],"STOP LAUGHING, YOU WHORES!!"
[OTH],"I SAID, SHUT UP!!"
[OTH],Let's hear it for Ms. Crabtree. What an up-and-comer!
[OTH],"Well. That was great, ma'am."
[OTH],Was it? Does it even matter?
[OTH],Wwhat do ya mean?
[OTH],"Success is hollow, Mitch, hollow like a dead tree. I think it's time for me to give it up."
[OTH],Are you sure?
[OTH],Ah-I'm sure. Let's get a cup of coffee.
Cartman,I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again?
[OTH],We've just gotta stick together.
[OTH],Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
Cartman,"Hay, wait a minute."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
[OTH],"Go, Fonzie!"
[OTH],Eeeeyyyy!
Cartman,"You can do it, Fonzie."
[OTH],"We believe in you, Fonz."
[OTH],Eeeeyyyy!
[OTH],"(Hey, that freakin' bike-!)"
[OTH],Eeyy!
[OTH],Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
[OTH],You bastards!
Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh."
[OTH],"You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense."
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],What are we gonna do?
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Now we need more weight in the back.
[OTH],"No, that's too much!"
[OTH],There. I think we got it.
[OTH],"I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude."
[OTH],Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
Cartman,It does?
[OTH],Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
[OTH],"Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help."
[OTH],"Don't do it, kid."
[OTH],Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
[OTH],Nooooo-agh!
[OTH],"Holy crap, dude!"
[OTH],Hey look! He's got ice cream!
[OTH],Hooray! Yea!
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Yea! Ha ha.
[OTH],"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation."
[OTH],"Wow, this is gorgeous. I don't think I've ever seen anything so beautiful."
[OTH],"From a distance, this place looks like a cold, damp marsh. But once you get inside it..."
[OTH],"...you realize that it has an inner beauty, far surpassing others."
[OTH],"Thank you for sharing your time with me, Ms. Crabtree."
[OTH],Please. Call me Muffin.
[OTH],"I'm having a nice time, Muffin."
[OTH],"Me too, Marcus. I've forgotten all about my cares in the world."
Cartman,"Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones."
[OTH],"Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it."
[OTH],Hey yeah!
[OTH],"...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries."
[OTH],"Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa."
[OTH],"Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message."
[OTH],"Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold"
[OTH],Du-hude! Your dad's a retard!
[OTH],"Please come home, Kyle."
[OTH],You left home lookin' for somethin' new.
[OTH],But all you need is right here waitin' for you
[OTH],"Runaway, come home. We love you just as you are.
Runaway, come home. We're sorry things went this far."
[OTH],"Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?"
[OTH],I hope my dad doesn't sing.
Cartman,Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?
[OTH],"Boy, do I!"
[OTH],"Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... John Elway."
Cartman,Sweeeeeett!
[OTH],Uh oh.
Cartman,"This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father!"
Cartman,"My father is John Elway,
My father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun."
[OTH],"Come on, son. I'll buy you some ice cream."
Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sti-"
[OTH],Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
Cartman,"What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts!"
[OTH],"Cartman, no!"
[OTH],Aaaaaa!
[OTH],The bus is going over!
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],Aaaaa. Aaaaaaa.
[OTH],Aaaaa!
[OTH],Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,"Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-"
Cartman,"Deah, eh eh. Oh man, what a weird dream!"
[OTH],"Ah-are you okay, hon?"
Cartman,"Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream."
[OTH],Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast?
Cartman,"Yes, please."
[OTH],Mmmm.
Cartman,Mmmm. Mmmm.
[OTH],Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream.
[OTH],GAAA-uh.
[OTH],"Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Dude, I just had the weirdest dream."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles."
[OTH],Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
[OTH],"Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems."
[OTH],Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
[OTH],Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later.
[OTH],"I want to thank you for making me feel alive again, Marcus."
[OTH],Ms. Crabtree?
[OTH],What is it? What's wrong?
[OTH],You realize I can't stay. None of this is real: it's... it's all been a little eight-year old's dream.
[OTH],"Oh I know. I know, Marcus. But let me just pretend as long as I can."
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],BE QUIET BACK THERRE! THESE ROADS ARE SLIICK!
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman!"
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Cartman,"Hmmm, let me see. No!"
[OTH],"Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!"
Cartman,Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
[OTH],"Give us some, Cartman!"
[OTH],BE QUIET BACK THERRE!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there."
[OTH],"Dude, the road is always snowy."
[OTH],"I know, but, it's really snowy today."
Cartman,"Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Okay, that does it! Y'all be quiet or the cute little bunny dies!"
[OTH],"Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would."
[OTH],"Oh, she would, dude. She would."
[OTH],GOODD!
[OTH],"OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!"
[OTH],"Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now."
Cartman,"I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try."
[OTH],"Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!"
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],Whoa oh.
[OTH],Hold oonn! Aaaaa!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],I'm scared!
[OTH],"BE QUIET, KID!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They're indigenous to this area.
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],What was what?
[OTH],Aaaah-
Cartman,All done!
[OTH],SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!
[OTH],"I SAID 'QUIET,' OR ELSE I KILL THE BUNNY!"
[OTH],Where are we?
[OTH],I have no idea.
[OTH],I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
[OTH],"Yeah, what are we supposed to do?"
[OTH],Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual.
Cartman,Ms. Crabtree?
[OTH],"SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!"
[OTH],"Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.'"
[OTH],"KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!"
[OTH],"That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'"
[OTH],"I'm goin' for help. Ah'll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don't get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!"
[OTH],"Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat her?"
[OTH],"'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!"
[OTH],WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[OTH],"I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on."
[OTH],"Had to happen to me, didn't it?"
[OTH],"Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too-"
[OTH],"Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa."
[OTH],"Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way?"
[OTH],SHUT UP AND HELP ME INTO THIS THIING!
[OTH],Whoa. Hehum huh.
[OTH],Yeah! COME ON! I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY!
[OTH],"Uh huh. Alright, sure, of course."
[OTH],"TAKE ME TO THE NEAREST TOWN AND MAKE IT SNAPPY, YOU FREAK-ASS CRACKPOT!"
[OTH],"Uuuh, yeh, yes ma'am. Righta right away, ma'am.}"
[OTH],"So uh... Uhwhat's a- fragile little doe like yourself doin' out on a, on a night like this?"
[OTH],"LOOK, MISTER, I GOT A BUSLOAD OF KIDS TRAPPED UP ON THAT PASS! I NEED A CRANE, HELICOPTERS, ALL THAT CRAP! HERE, LET ME HAVE SOME O' YOUR ASPIRIN!"
[OTH],"Uh uh- ma'am, those are actually roofies."
[OTH],"ROOFIES, ASPIRIN, RIGHT NOW I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS!"
[OTH],HOW FAR TO THE NEAREST TOOWWN?!
[OTH],Mm-... mm-it's a ways.
Cartman,"You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever."
[OTH],What? Huh?
[OTH],"We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days."
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],What?
Cartman,I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes! You guys suck!
[OTH],Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
[OTH],Worse than this?
[OTH],"Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary."
Cartman,"Oh, man, this sucks."
[OTH],How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
[OTH],I think we have to signal them somehow.
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"Hey, he's like Rudolph."
[OTH],"Yeah. All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!"
Cartman,"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight."
[OTH],Sure you do!
[OTH],"Come on Cartman, fart!"
Cartman,I don't wanna.
[OTH],He can't hold it in forever.
[OTH],"Fart, damn you!"
Cartman,"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!"
[OTH],"Whoa, look at that."
Cartman,It's completely immature!
[OTH],"Hey, it's happening again."
[OTH],"It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?"
Cartman,You guys can't scare me!
[OTH],"Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass."
[OTH],"Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream."
[OTH],Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay.
[OTH],Mmmm.
[OTH],"Now, that was what I call a sticky situation."
[OTH],You can say that again.
Cartman,Was that how it happened?
[OTH],"STOOPP! LET ME OFF, YOU TURD!"
[OTH],"Hey. Uh I wanna help you. Uh, I care a lot about that bus full of uuh- what was it again?"
[OTH],Children.
[OTH],"Yeah right. Leh, let me come with you."
[OTH],WHO- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAAP?!
[OTH],"I hate flyin'. Talk about somethin' I hate, it's flyin'."
[OTH],"Say uuhh, are those roofies kickin' in yet?"
[OTH],"WELL, I DON'T THINK SO!"
[OTH],Damn!
[OTH],D'you guys like impressions?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],Here's my impression of Robert De Niro.
[OTH],"Hey, youse. Youse guys. Shut up, youse!"
[OTH],YOU SUUCK!!
[OTH],"Youse guys, shut up!"
[OTH],SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!
[OTH],"Come on, lady. Iii love you. You love me."
[OTH],"I SAAIID, SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!"
[OTH],"Baby, you're wonderful! You're a natural! You're the funniest comic I've seen in yeauhs!"
[OTH],WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP. I'VE GOT TO GET SOME ASSISTANCE FOR MY BROKEN-DOWN BUUSS!!
[OTH],Broken-down bus! That's great! Great angle!
[OTH],Do you see 'er dude?
[OTH],Nope.
Cartman,"God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?"
[OTH],She's never coming back. Don't you get it? She left us here to die like pigs.
[OTH],"Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny."
[OTH],(Huh?)
[OTH],I can't take it anymore! I have to get out of here!
[OTH],"No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!"
[OTH],"Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help."
[OTH],"Don't do it, kid."
[OTH],Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
[OTH],Nooooo-agh!
[OTH],"Holy crap, dude!"
[OTH],Gross!
[OTH],"Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother."
[OTH],"Oh yes, Sharon. How are you?"
[OTH],"Ms. Cartman, is your son at home?"
[OTH],"Hu-old on, dear, let me check."
[OTH],"Hon, I made beefy logs."
[OTH],I made Cookie Dings.
[OTH],"No, he's not here."
[OTH],"Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are."
[OTH],"Oh, dear!"
[OTH],"I'm telling you, Marty, this woman is a natural! I haven't seen a funnier person since Maury Povich."
[OTH],What's her angle?
[OTH],I can't even explain it. You have to see it.
[OTH],"Alright. Well, this better be good."
[OTH],"Come on in, come on in."
[OTH],"WHUAT THE HELL DID YOU BRING ME TO DENVER FOR, YOU BRAIN-DEPRAVED FECOPHILIAC?!"
[OTH],"Mr. Jonus, this is Mrs. Crabtree."
[OTH],Pleasure to meet you.
[OTH],YOU LOOK LIKE A LUMP OF DOGSHIT JUST GOT HIT BY A CAR!!
[OTH],What did I tell you?
[OTH],"She's fantastic. How would you like to make a million dollars, baby?"
[OTH],HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY ASS?!
[OTH],Let's get started right away.
[OTH],Are you gonna be all right?
[OTH],DON'T TOUCH ME!
[OTH],Uh ah-I'm sorry. Do you need anything?
[OTH],No. I just...
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I can't help but feel that I've forgotten somethin'.
[OTH],What time is it?
[OTH],(Almost 7:30.)
[OTH],On Wednesday or Thursday?
[OTH],"Dude, I think it's Saturday now."
Cartman,What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
[OTH],"Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus."
[OTH],"Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us."
Cartman,What do you think it is?
[OTH],"I don't know, it's- a big scary monster."
[OTH],"Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
[OTH],Aaaaaa!
[OTH],The lava's comin' right for us!
Cartman,Heellp!
[OTH],"Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!"
Cartman,What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
[OTH],Oh my God! Look at his leg!
[OTH],"Hi kids, I'm TV's Brent Musberger."
[OTH],Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
[OTH],Aaaa!
[OTH],"Quick Ned, shoot it!"
[OTH],"Mmm. Oh no, out of ammo."
[OTH],"Hey, look!"
[OTH],Grrrr.
[OTH],Dude! He's making ice cream.
Cartman,Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!
[OTH],"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation."
[OTH],"Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice."
Cartman,"Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!"
Cartman,"Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?"
[OTH],Here she comes!
[OTH],Come on you little bitch.
[OTH],It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, stop!"
[OTH],Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
[OTH],But Mr. Garrison!
[OTH],She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien.
[OTH],Thank you. And I love you all.
[OTH],Naawwr!
[OTH],"See, I told ya."
[OTH],Mmmm.
[OTH],"Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day. Let's have ice cream, everyone!"
Cartman,Beefcaake!
Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation."
[OTH],"But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun."
Cartman,"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],"Live from Burbank, it's The Tonight Show, with Jay Leno. Tonight, Jay's special guests include: Washed-up Actress from a sitcom. And the comedy of Mrs. Crabtree. And now, here's your host, Jay Leno."
[OTH],"Just relax, sweetheart, you're gonna kill out there."
[OTH],KILL WHO?!
[OTH],Huh that's great. Use that.
[OTH],"Honey du-, do you need anything?"
[OTH],JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE OF THEM ROOFIES.
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Oh oh okay? Let's try to calm down, n'kay? This type of thing happens all the time."
[OTH],What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!
[OTH],"Well, 99% of the time, when a child is missing, it's because they've run away. M'kay?"
[OTH],Run away?
[OTH],"Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah."
[OTH],How do we get our runaway children back?
[OTH],"Well, we just need to make some posters, nkay? Hand out brochures, onkay? That way, the public can know what the chldren look like and can call in if thry're spotted, m'kay?"
[OTH],Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.
[OTH],It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.
[OTH],"Come on, everybody!"
[OTH],We've got to find those kids!
[OTH],"If we all put our heads together, we can find them!"
[OTH],We can do it!
[OTH],Hi.
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],What was what?
[OTH],"Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!"
[OTH],What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
[OTH],(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
[OTH],"Hey yeah, I remember that."
[OTH],"(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)"
[OTH],Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
[OTH],Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
[OTH],Come over here you son of a whore!
[OTH],(Take... that!)
[OTH],"(You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!)"
[OTH],Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
[OTH],You... bastard?
[OTH],(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!)
[OTH],"Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you."
[OTH],"(Oh, yeah.)"
[OTH],"Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right?"
[OTH],AAAAH!
[OTH],MOMMY!
[OTH],"(Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!)"
[OTH],"Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],"Hoh boy, we're in big trouble."
Cartman,Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
[OTH],WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ALL STARIN' AT?!
[OTH],"STOP LAUGHING, YOU WHORES!!"
[OTH],"I SAID, SHUT UP!!"
[OTH],Let's hear it for Ms. Crabtree. What an up-and-comer!
[OTH],"Well. That was great, ma'am."
[OTH],Was it? Does it even matter?
[OTH],Wwhat do ya mean?
[OTH],"Success is hollow, Mitch, hollow like a dead tree. I think it's time for me to give it up."
[OTH],Are you sure?
[OTH],Ah-I'm sure. Let's get a cup of coffee.
Cartman,I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again?
[OTH],We've just gotta stick together.
[OTH],Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
Cartman,"Hay, wait a minute."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
[OTH],"Go, Fonzie!"
[OTH],Eeeeyyyy!
Cartman,"You can do it, Fonzie."
[OTH],"We believe in you, Fonz."
[OTH],Eeeeyyyy!
[OTH],"(Hey, that freakin' bike-!)"
[OTH],Eeyy!
[OTH],Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
[OTH],You bastards!
Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh."
[OTH],"You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense."
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],What are we gonna do?
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Now we need more weight in the back.
[OTH],"No, that's too much!"
[OTH],There. I think we got it.
[OTH],"I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude."
[OTH],Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
Cartman,It does?
[OTH],Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
[OTH],"Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help."
[OTH],"Don't do it, kid."
[OTH],Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
[OTH],Nooooo-agh!
[OTH],"Holy crap, dude!"
[OTH],Hey look! He's got ice cream!
[OTH],Hooray! Yea!
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],Yea! Ha ha.
[OTH],"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation."
[OTH],"Wow, this is gorgeous. I don't think I've ever seen anything so beautiful."
[OTH],"From a distance, this place looks like a cold, damp marsh. But once you get inside it..."
[OTH],"...you realize that it has an inner beauty, far surpassing others."
[OTH],"Thank you for sharing your time with me, Ms. Crabtree."
[OTH],Please. Call me Muffin.
[OTH],"I'm having a nice time, Muffin."
[OTH],"Me too, Marcus. I've forgotten all about my cares in the world."
Cartman,"Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones."
[OTH],"Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it."
[OTH],Hey yeah!
[OTH],"...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries."
[OTH],"Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa."
[OTH],"Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message."
[OTH],"Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold"
[OTH],Du-hude! Your dad's a retard!
[OTH],"Please come home, Kyle."
[OTH],You left home lookin' for somethin' new.
[OTH],But all you need is right here waitin' for you
[OTH],"Runaway, come home. We love you just as you are.
Runaway, come home. We're sorry things went this far."
[OTH],"Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?"
[OTH],I hope my dad doesn't sing.
Cartman,Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?
[OTH],"Boy, do I!"
[OTH],"Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... John Elway."
Cartman,Sweeeeeett!
[OTH],Uh oh.
Cartman,"This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father!"
Cartman,"My father is John Elway,
My father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun."
[OTH],"Come on, son. I'll buy you some ice cream."
Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sti-"
[OTH],Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
Cartman,"What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts!"
[OTH],"Cartman, no!"
[OTH],Aaaaaa!
[OTH],The bus is going over!
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],Aaaaa. Aaaaaaa.
[OTH],Aaaaa!
[OTH],Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,"Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-"
Cartman,"Deah, eh eh. Oh man, what a weird dream!"
[OTH],"Ah-are you okay, hon?"
Cartman,"Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream."
[OTH],Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast?
Cartman,"Yes, please."
[OTH],Mmmm.
Cartman,Mmmm. Mmmm.
[OTH],Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream.
[OTH],GAAA-uh.
[OTH],"Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Dude, I just had the weirdest dream."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles."
[OTH],Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
[OTH],"Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems."
[OTH],Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
[OTH],Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later.
[OTH],"I want to thank you for making me feel alive again, Marcus."
[OTH],Ms. Crabtree?
[OTH],What is it? What's wrong?
[OTH],You realize I can't stay. None of this is real: it's... it's all been a little eight-year old's dream.
[OTH],"Oh I know. I know, Marcus. But let me just pretend as long as I can."
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!"
[OTH],The prank is over!
[OTH],"You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch."
[OTH],God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!
[OTH],Yea--
[OTH],"Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!"
[OTH],Awww..!
[OTH],"Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!"
[OTH],Okay. I'm going to turn around now.
[OTH],Shit!
[OTH],Where did everybody go?
[OTH],Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!
[OTH],"Oh golly, Kevin, honey."
[OTH],"Good to see you again, son."
[OTH],Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready.
[OTH],"Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!"
[OTH],"Shut up, Pip."
[OTH],"Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?"
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead."
Cartman,"Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!"
[OTH],"Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks."
[OTH],I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
[OTH],"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt."
[OTH],Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
Cartman,"Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!"
[OTH],"Jesus, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na."
[OTH],"Hi, fellas."
[OTH],"Hi, Stu."
[OTH],What can I do for you?
[OTH],We wanna buy M-80s.
[OTH],The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
Cartman,"Okay, that's it!"
Cartman,Screw you guys! I'm going home.
[OTH],What a baby.
[OTH],"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?"
[OTH],Heard what?
[OTH],All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.
[OTH],What do ya mean?
[OTH],It was in the paper this morning.
[OTH],"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?"
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
[OTH],Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
[OTH],"Oh gosh, killed Kenny!"
[OTH],Oo bastards!
[OTH],"A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass."
[OTH],"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?"
[OTH],I can still sell snakes.
[OTH],Awww..!
[OTH],"This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake. I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call. Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems! Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smart-ass, I was being ironic..!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat."
[OTH],"Well, keep looking."
[OTH],Oh?
[OTH],This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
[OTH],"Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow."
[OTH],"Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa-- Oooooogh..."
[OTH],I found him.
[OTH],"Man, it's hot out here."
Cartman,What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
[OTH],"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks."
[OTH],I know! Let's go sledding!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman, get on."
Cartman,Stan?
[OTH],"Let's go, dude. We're ready."
[OTH],"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?"
Cartman,Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
[OTH],Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
Cartman,Ugh... Whatever.
[OTH],What the hell is going on?
[OTH],"Hey there, boys!"
[OTH],"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
[OTH],How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
[OTH],Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year."
[OTH],"Oh my God! Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case. Buckle your seat belt, Ned."
[OTH],Mmmm-where are we going?
[OTH],"México, my amigo."
[OTH],Mmmm-why are we going to México?
[OTH],"To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?"
[OTH],Are fireworks legal in Mexico?
[OTH],"Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way."
[OTH],"At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while--"
[OTH],Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
[OTH],"Oh, o-kay. Let's see..."
[OTH],"Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake."
[OTH],Ooooh!
[OTH],We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.
[OTH],Comanche helicopters...
[OTH],"Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time."
[OTH],"...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time..."
[OTH],"Once lit, the snake will grow."
[OTH],And good times will be had by all.
[OTH],Wonderful.
[OTH],Spectacular.
[OTH],"Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!"
[OTH],Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert.
[OTH],Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
[OTH],"Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?"
[OTH],"Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!"
[OTH],Dusty the dirtball...
[OTH],Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
[OTH],"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Hello, children. How is your summer going?"
[OTH],"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?"
[OTH],"Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat."
[OTH],That's good.
[OTH],Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Mr. Hat isn't real.
[OTH],Right.
Cartman,"Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?"
[OTH],"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard."
Cartman,It is not!
[OTH],Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
[OTH],"Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee."
Cartman,I am not swimming around in pee!
[OTH],"Whatever, dude."
Cartman,"My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday."
[OTH],"Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics."
Cartman,I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
[OTH],"But Cartman, we're trying to--"
Cartman,"No, screw you guys. Home."
[OTH],"What does he mean, ""living in denial""?"
[OTH],"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always."
[OTH],"There, how does that look?"
[OTH],Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
[OTH],"Uh, crap..!"
Cartman,Eh-eh-eh-eh...
[OTH],"Okay kids, everyone in the pool!"
[OTH],"Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now."
Cartman,Nuh-uh.
[OTH],Just jump in.
Cartman,I don't wanna.
[OTH],"It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it."
Cartman,Egh--
[OTH],"There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us."
Cartman,Huh? First graders?
Cartman,"Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, these sons of bitches!"
[OTH],Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
[OTH],I'm sure it'll be here any second.
[OTH],Shut up!
[OTH],Copy that.
[OTH],"Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman?"
[OTH],He's taking swimming lessons.
[OTH],"Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And..."
[OTH],"Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's Symphony No. 5."
[OTH],"Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing."
[OTH],Wait a minute... It's the snake!
[OTH],"Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all."
[OTH],"Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!"
[OTH],"Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr. (Good morning, my friend. I am a spectacular American.)"
[OTH],¿Qué? (What?)
[OTH],Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr. (I need the spectacular firework.)
[OTH],¿Necesita usted un cohete grande? (Do you need a large rocket?)
[OTH],Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr. (Do not disturb the spectacular cat.)
[OTH],"Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone."
[OTH],Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr.
[OTH],"Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July."
[OTH],We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
[OTH],Hmmm-bueyno.
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Hello, is Mr. Hat there?"
[OTH],Is this some kind of joke?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
[OTH],"I don't think you can, m'kay."
[OTH],Goddammit..!
[OTH],"So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today?"
[OTH],"Well, I'd like to sing you a song."
[OTH],"Hey, let's sing one to-gether!"
[OTH],"As long as we're together,
we can do anything
We can take on the whole darn world
We're happy as clams,
with plenty of pearls
Through thick and thin,
we've always been to-geth-er..."
[OTH],Whoa-aagghh! Aagghh! Aggh!
[OTH],"No! Lamb Chop, no!"
[OTH],"Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..!"
[OTH],"Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later."
Cartman,Later's fine.
[OTH],Just do your side stroke.
Cartman,I only know how to do it doggie style.
[OTH],"That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!"
Cartman,Can I do it doggie style?
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"That's it! That's it, you can do it!"
Cartman,Sweet..!
Cartman,"Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!"
[OTH],"Come on, Eric!"
Cartman,No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
[OTH],"Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history."
[OTH],"Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us."
[OTH],"Alrighty then, looks like we're ready."
[OTH],"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?"
Cartman,Fine.
[OTH],I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Cartman,"Well, you heard wrong, hippie!"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!"
[OTH],This is it. And a-one and a-two and a...
[OTH],Ooohhhh..!
[OTH],What is fuck is that?!
[OTH],I think it's The Stars and Stripes.
[OTH],"Oh, hell. Light the snake!"
[OTH],Ooooooh!
[OTH],Ahhhhh!
[OTH],"Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking."
[OTH],"I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?"
[OTH],"Good evening, gentlemen."
[OTH],"Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland."
[OTH],"Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions."
[OTH],"Fire away, we have nothing to hide."
[OTH],Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
[OTH],"No, sir."
[OTH],Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
[OTH],"Yes. I mean, no! No!"
[OTH],"Open your trunk, please, sir."
[OTH],Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
[OTH],"My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity."
[OTH],"Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?"
[OTH],Die out?
[OTH],"Yes, you know, expire, end."
[OTH],Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
[OTH],"Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big."
[OTH],"I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?"
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Dude! That thing is huge!
[OTH],"Yeah, they need to shut it off."
Cartman,Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!
[OTH],Somebody stop it!
[OTH],It's out of control!
Cartman,Aarrgghh!!
[OTH],Kenny! Watch out!
[OTH],(Waarrggh!!)
[OTH],"(Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!)"
[OTH],"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],"Oh my God! You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!"
[OTH],Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes...
[OTH],So when does it run out?!
[OTH],November. Of next year.
[OTH],"Oh, hell..!"
[OTH],"Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work."
[OTH],"Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future."
[OTH],"Man, this sucks."
[OTH],"What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!"
[OTH],We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
Cartman,Where is Chef?
[OTH],"Baby, you know you're the girl for me-ee
And all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and me
And her; simultaneous
You and me, and you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three; simultaneous
Ooh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what?... A giant snake?... Killing everybody?!... Growing bigger?!... Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, fudge ya. Simultaneous, you and me
And you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three..."
[OTH],What'd he say?
[OTH],"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves."
Cartman,Wow.
[OTH],How is that gonna help?
[OTH],"All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen."
[OTH],"Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you."
[OTH],"From this day on, all will be well."
[OTH],I already feel like things are getting better.
[OTH],And I can't sleep or think...
[OTH],Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
[OTH],"Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went?"
[OTH],"How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?"
[OTH],"Well… I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah."
[OTH],"At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning."
[OTH],Um... Ahem...
[OTH],Are you gay?
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],It-it's j-just-- It's just a question.
[OTH],Are you propositioning me?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!"
[OTH],"Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you."
[OTH],"Mr. Hat, on the other hand..."
[OTH],Mr. Hat was gay?
[OTH],Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
[OTH],I see.
[OTH],"Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing."
[OTH],That I did not need to know.
[OTH],"Well, I'm just sayin'."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet."
[OTH],What do you think about that?
[OTH],I think you're the loony one in this room.
[OTH],"Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo."
[OTH],"Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again."
[OTH],Mmmmmmm-yup.
[OTH],Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
[OTH],Mmm-well better luck next year.
[OTH],"Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again."
[OTH],Mmmm-is anyone other than the two of you riding in this vehicle?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],Mmmm-do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?
[OTH],Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
[OTH],Mmm-it looks like my ex-wife!
[OTH],"Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!"
[OTH],Hi. I hasn't seen you in here before.
[OTH],"As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000..."
[OTH],...people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers.
[OTH],...And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now.
[OTH],"Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she is... sick."
[OTH],"""Sick""?! What kind of lame excuse is that?"
[OTH],You gotta be kidding me!
[OTH],"Oh, this is ridiculous!"
[OTH],"Come on, we want answers."
[OTH],Sh-she's having her period.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"We do, however, have an official statement for all the concerned cities about the matter with the giant snake that we can't seem to put out."
[OTH],"""We're sorry. Our bad."""
[OTH],"Thank you, that is all."
Cartman,Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.
Cartman,Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it.
[OTH],How many days left in summer?
[OTH],"A lot, I think."
[OTH],Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
[OTH],"I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon."
[OTH],"Buenos gracias, boys."
[OTH],"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
[OTH],"Oh, now, why the long faces?"
[OTH],We're bored.
[OTH],There's nothin' to do.
[OTH],"Well, I don't think those are problems..."
[OTH],...that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Careful with those, now, those are dangerous."
[OTH],"Point 'em away from your eyes, now."
[OTH],Wow! These are huge!
[OTH],"Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child."
[OTH],"Hey, look! We blew up the snake!"
[OTH],All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out.
[OTH],"Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!"
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.
Cartman,I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
[OTH],The snake's been destroyed. The pool's open!
Cartman,Huh?
Cartman,"Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!"
[OTH],Look! They put out the snake!
[OTH],"Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly."
[OTH],"Hey, look! It's snowing!"
[OTH],"Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell."
[OTH],Winter's back!
[OTH],"Wow, it's a black blizzard!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig."
[OTH],"That's right, children. I'll see you in the fall."
[OTH],"Well, I can hardly wait."
[OTH],"Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..?"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef!"
Cartman,How's it going?
[OTH],"Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation?"
[OTH],"Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!"
[OTH],The prank is over!
[OTH],"You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch."
[OTH],God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!
[OTH],Yea--
[OTH],"Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!"
[OTH],Awww..!
[OTH],"Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!"
[OTH],Okay. I'm going to turn around now.
[OTH],Shit!
[OTH],Where did everybody go?
[OTH],Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!
[OTH],"Oh golly, Kevin, honey."
[OTH],"Good to see you again, son."
[OTH],Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready.
[OTH],"Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!"
[OTH],"Shut up, Pip."
[OTH],"Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?"
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead."
Cartman,"Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!"
[OTH],"Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks."
[OTH],I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
[OTH],"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt."
[OTH],Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
Cartman,"Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!"
[OTH],"Jesus, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na."
[OTH],"Hi, fellas."
[OTH],"Hi, Stu."
[OTH],What can I do for you?
[OTH],We wanna buy M-80s.
[OTH],The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
Cartman,"Okay, that's it!"
Cartman,Screw you guys! I'm going home.
[OTH],What a baby.
[OTH],"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?"
[OTH],Heard what?
[OTH],All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.
[OTH],What do ya mean?
[OTH],It was in the paper this morning.
[OTH],"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?"
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
[OTH],Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
[OTH],"Oh gosh, killed Kenny!"
[OTH],Oo bastards!
[OTH],"A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass."
[OTH],"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?"
[OTH],I can still sell snakes.
[OTH],Awww..!
[OTH],"This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake. I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call. Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems! Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smart-ass, I was being ironic..!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat."
[OTH],"Well, keep looking."
[OTH],Oh?
[OTH],This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
[OTH],"Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow."
[OTH],"Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa-- Oooooogh..."
[OTH],I found him.
[OTH],"Man, it's hot out here."
Cartman,What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
[OTH],"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks."
[OTH],I know! Let's go sledding!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman, get on."
Cartman,Stan?
[OTH],"Let's go, dude. We're ready."
[OTH],"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?"
Cartman,Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
[OTH],Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
Cartman,Ugh... Whatever.
[OTH],What the hell is going on?
[OTH],"Hey there, boys!"
[OTH],"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
[OTH],How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
[OTH],Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year."
[OTH],"Oh my God! Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case. Buckle your seat belt, Ned."
[OTH],Mmmm-where are we going?
[OTH],"México, my amigo."
[OTH],Mmmm-why are we going to México?
[OTH],"To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?"
[OTH],Are fireworks legal in Mexico?
[OTH],"Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way."
[OTH],"At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while--"
[OTH],Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
[OTH],"Oh, o-kay. Let's see..."
[OTH],"Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake."
[OTH],Ooooh!
[OTH],We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.
[OTH],Comanche helicopters...
[OTH],"Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time."
[OTH],"...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time..."
[OTH],"Once lit, the snake will grow."
[OTH],And good times will be had by all.
[OTH],Wonderful.
[OTH],Spectacular.
[OTH],"Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!"
[OTH],Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert.
[OTH],Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
[OTH],"Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?"
[OTH],"Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!"
[OTH],Dusty the dirtball...
[OTH],Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
[OTH],"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Hello, children. How is your summer going?"
[OTH],"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?"
[OTH],"Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat."
[OTH],That's good.
[OTH],Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Mr. Hat isn't real.
[OTH],Right.
Cartman,"Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?"
[OTH],"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard."
Cartman,It is not!
[OTH],Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
[OTH],"Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee."
Cartman,I am not swimming around in pee!
[OTH],"Whatever, dude."
Cartman,"My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday."
[OTH],"Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics."
Cartman,I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
[OTH],"But Cartman, we're trying to--"
Cartman,"No, screw you guys. Home."
[OTH],"What does he mean, ""living in denial""?"
[OTH],"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always."
[OTH],"There, how does that look?"
[OTH],Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
[OTH],"Uh, crap..!"
Cartman,Eh-eh-eh-eh...
[OTH],"Okay kids, everyone in the pool!"
[OTH],"Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now."
Cartman,Nuh-uh.
[OTH],Just jump in.
Cartman,I don't wanna.
[OTH],"It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it."
Cartman,Egh--
[OTH],"There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us."
Cartman,Huh? First graders?
Cartman,"Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, these sons of bitches!"
[OTH],Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
[OTH],I'm sure it'll be here any second.
[OTH],Shut up!
[OTH],Copy that.
[OTH],"Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman?"
[OTH],He's taking swimming lessons.
[OTH],"Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And..."
[OTH],"Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's Symphony No. 5."
[OTH],"Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing."
[OTH],Wait a minute... It's the snake!
[OTH],"Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all."
[OTH],"Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!"
[OTH],"Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr. (Good morning, my friend. I am a spectacular American.)"
[OTH],¿Qué? (What?)
[OTH],Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr. (I need the spectacular firework.)
[OTH],¿Necesita usted un cohete grande? (Do you need a large rocket?)
[OTH],Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr. (Do not disturb the spectacular cat.)
[OTH],"Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone."
[OTH],Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr.
[OTH],"Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July."
[OTH],We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
[OTH],Hmmm-bueyno.
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Hello, is Mr. Hat there?"
[OTH],Is this some kind of joke?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
[OTH],"I don't think you can, m'kay."
[OTH],Goddammit..!
[OTH],"So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today?"
[OTH],"Well, I'd like to sing you a song."
[OTH],"Hey, let's sing one to-gether!"
[OTH],"As long as we're together,
we can do anything
We can take on the whole darn world
We're happy as clams,
with plenty of pearls
Through thick and thin,
we've always been to-geth-er..."
[OTH],Whoa-aagghh! Aagghh! Aggh!
[OTH],"No! Lamb Chop, no!"
[OTH],"Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..!"
[OTH],"Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later."
Cartman,Later's fine.
[OTH],Just do your side stroke.
Cartman,I only know how to do it doggie style.
[OTH],"That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!"
Cartman,Can I do it doggie style?
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"That's it! That's it, you can do it!"
Cartman,Sweet..!
Cartman,"Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!"
[OTH],"Come on, Eric!"
Cartman,No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
[OTH],"Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history."
[OTH],"Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us."
[OTH],"Alrighty then, looks like we're ready."
[OTH],"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?"
Cartman,Fine.
[OTH],I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Cartman,"Well, you heard wrong, hippie!"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!"
[OTH],This is it. And a-one and a-two and a...
[OTH],Ooohhhh..!
[OTH],What is fuck is that?!
[OTH],I think it's The Stars and Stripes.
[OTH],"Oh, hell. Light the snake!"
[OTH],Ooooooh!
[OTH],Ahhhhh!
[OTH],"Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking."
[OTH],"I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?"
[OTH],"Good evening, gentlemen."
[OTH],"Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland."
[OTH],"Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions."
[OTH],"Fire away, we have nothing to hide."
[OTH],Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
[OTH],"No, sir."
[OTH],Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
[OTH],"Yes. I mean, no! No!"
[OTH],"Open your trunk, please, sir."
[OTH],Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
[OTH],"My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity."
[OTH],"Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?"
[OTH],Die out?
[OTH],"Yes, you know, expire, end."
[OTH],Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
[OTH],"Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big."
[OTH],"I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?"
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Dude! That thing is huge!
[OTH],"Yeah, they need to shut it off."
Cartman,Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!
[OTH],Somebody stop it!
[OTH],It's out of control!
Cartman,Aarrgghh!!
[OTH],Kenny! Watch out!
[OTH],(Waarrggh!!)
[OTH],"(Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!)"
[OTH],"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],"Oh my God! You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!"
[OTH],Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes...
[OTH],So when does it run out?!
[OTH],November. Of next year.
[OTH],"Oh, hell..!"
[OTH],"Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work."
[OTH],"Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future."
[OTH],"Man, this sucks."
[OTH],"What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!"
[OTH],We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
Cartman,Where is Chef?
[OTH],"Baby, you know you're the girl for me-ee
And all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and me
And her; simultaneous
You and me, and you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three; simultaneous
Ooh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what?... A giant snake?... Killing everybody?!... Growing bigger?!... Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, fudge ya. Simultaneous, you and me
And you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three..."
[OTH],What'd he say?
[OTH],"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves."
Cartman,Wow.
[OTH],How is that gonna help?
[OTH],"All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen."
[OTH],"Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you."
[OTH],"From this day on, all will be well."
[OTH],I already feel like things are getting better.
[OTH],And I can't sleep or think...
[OTH],Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
[OTH],"Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went?"
[OTH],"How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?"
[OTH],"Well… I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah."
[OTH],"At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning."
[OTH],Um... Ahem...
[OTH],Are you gay?
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],It-it's j-just-- It's just a question.
[OTH],Are you propositioning me?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!"
[OTH],"Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you."
[OTH],"Mr. Hat, on the other hand..."
[OTH],Mr. Hat was gay?
[OTH],Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
[OTH],I see.
[OTH],"Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing."
[OTH],That I did not need to know.
[OTH],"Well, I'm just sayin'."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet."
[OTH],What do you think about that?
[OTH],I think you're the loony one in this room.
[OTH],"Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo."
[OTH],"Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again."
[OTH],Mmmmmmm-yup.
[OTH],Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
[OTH],Mmm-well better luck next year.
[OTH],"Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again."
[OTH],Mmmm-is anyone other than the two of you riding in this vehicle?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],Mmmm-do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?
[OTH],Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
[OTH],Mmm-it looks like my ex-wife!
[OTH],"Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!"
[OTH],Hi. I hasn't seen you in here before.
[OTH],"As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000..."

[OTH],"""We're sorry. Our bad."""
[OTH],"Thank you, that is all."
Cartman,Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.
Cartman,Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it.
[OTH],How many days left in summer?
[OTH],"A lot, I think."
[OTH],Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
[OTH],"I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon."
[OTH],"Buenos gracias, boys."
[OTH],"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
[OTH],"Oh, now, why the long faces?"
[OTH],We're bored.
[OTH],There's nothin' to do.
[OTH],"Well, I don't think those are problems..."
[OTH],...that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Careful with those, now, those are dangerous."
[OTH],"Point 'em away from your eyes, now."
[OTH],Wow! These are huge!
[OTH],"Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child."
[OTH],"Hey, look! We blew up the snake!"
[OTH],All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out.
[OTH],"Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!"
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.
Cartman,I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
[OTH],The snake's been destroyed. The pool's open!
Cartman,Huh?
Cartman,"Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!"
[OTH],Look! They put out the snake!
[OTH],"Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly."
[OTH],"Hey, look! It's snowing!"
[OTH],"Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell."
[OTH],Winter's back!
[OTH],"Wow, it's a black blizzard!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig."
[OTH],"That's right, children. I'll see you in the fall."
[OTH],"Well, I can hardly wait."
[OTH],"Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..?"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef!"
Cartman,How's it going?
[OTH],"Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation?"
[OTH],"Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!"
[OTH],"Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded."
[OTH],"Because. People from L.A. love to come to a quaint little mountain town for a few days, and this gives them an excuse."
[OTH],"No, this used to be a quaint little mountain town. Now look at it. Sushi restaurants, upscale clothes stores, $25 parking, Liam Neeson... I tell you, Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's resources out. We must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again."
[OTH],That's not a bad idea. But where?
[OTH],Ching ching cha-ching.
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],"Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?"
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First Annual South Park Film Festival begins today."
[OTH],Wow! Cool!
[OTH],"They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?"
[OTH],"Nono, Kyle. These are independent films."
[OTH],"Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too."
Cartman,"No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding."
[OTH],No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
Cartman,"Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!"
[OTH],"Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!"
Cartman,"I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!"
[OTH],(Gasp)!
[OTH],"Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!"
Cartman,...bitch.
[OTH],"That's it Eric, you-!"
Cartman,I'm going!
[OTH],"Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it."
[OTH],"The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love."
[OTH],"Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer."
[OTH],"Norma, I want to shoot the script next month with Demi Moore instead."
[OTH],Well you can tell Spielberg he can kiss my ass!
[OTH],"Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city."
Cartman,I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
[OTH],She's not my girlfriend.
[OTH],"(Yeah, not when you vomit on her all the time like that.)"
[OTH],"Sick, Kenny."
[OTH],"Damn, dude. Look at all these people."
[OTH],"I'm late for a screening, I'll call you from the theater."
[OTH],All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],Whatcha doin'?
[OTH],"Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!"
Cartman,What kind of cookies?
[OTH],"Calm down, tubby."
[OTH],"They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, ""Fudge 'Ems""."
Cartman,I wanna Fudge 'Em.
[OTH],"I can just see the commercial now. ""Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."""
[OTH],Cool!
[OTH],"And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, ""Fudge This."""
[OTH],"Oh look, one of the natives is selling local food wares... how quaint."
[OTH],"This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture."
[OTH],"Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, ""Go Fudge Yourself,"" or my all-natural, ""I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."""
[OTH],"Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],I would kill for some cous cous right now.
[OTH],Whose goose?
[OTH],"Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A."
[OTH],"Cute sign, though."
[OTH],"Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?"
Cartman,"Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?"
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman! Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway."
Cartman,"She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him."
[OTH],If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
[OTH],"Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! ""I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"""
Cartman,"Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground."
[OTH],When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
[OTH],"Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them."
[OTH],They what?!
[OTH],Who are you to judge my womanly soul?
[OTH],The Goddess flames that burn in my memory aren't dark. Dare you call them dark!
[OTH],Here lies the Goddess truth of my body.
[OTH],"Oh, brother."
[OTH],"The Goddess that cries, ""Freedom!"""
[OTH],Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being
[OTH],"You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door."
[OTH],"Then make love to me, right now"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],Sshh!
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way-"
[OTH],Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
[OTH],"I'm poopies, ma!"
[OTH],"Well, hurry up!"
[OTH],Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
[OTH],Ky-yle! Ky-yle!
[OTH],Could it be?
[OTH],Hooowwwdy ho!
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?"
[OTH],"I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens, except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities."
[OTH],"It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!"
Cartman,"Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime."
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure it was him."
[OTH],"Look, look! Here comes somebody!"
[OTH],"Move aside, I can't see."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage."
[OTH],AAWWWW!
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon."
[OTH],"So how was that movie last night, dude?"
[OTH],"Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!"
Cartman,"It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?"
[OTH],"Yeah, pretty much."
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],"The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen."
[OTH],Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass.
Cartman,Ay!
[OTH],"Yeah, but that'd be like IMAX."
Cartman,"Okay, that's enough fat-ass jokes for this week."
[OTH],"(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh.)"
Cartman,"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home."
[OTH],Well?
Cartman,"I'm gonna, just give me a minute."
[OTH],"This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into."
[OTH],"Forgive me for being observant, but, won't we just end up doing the same thing to this town?"
[OTH],"Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles."
[OTH],Why? Why would we do such a thing?
[OTH],"Because we have to live in L.A. And if we can't live in quiet, simple, peaceful mountain towns, then nobody will!"
[OTH],Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will!
[OTH],That's it.
[OTH],"Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, ""Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls."""
[OTH],Are they good?
[OTH],Try 'em.
[OTH],"Hey, dude, these are good!"
Cartman,"Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef."
[OTH],Ky-yle!
[OTH],There it is again!
[OTH],There is what again?
[OTH],Ky-yle!
[OTH],It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble.
[OTH],"Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?"
[OTH],Where does that grill go?
[OTH],"To the sewer, dude."
[OTH],"Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!"
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],"Hey, everybody,
have you seen my balls?
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up,
just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em..."
Cartman,"Aw, man, smells like ass down here."
[OTH],"Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer!"
[OTH],What was that?
Cartman,"Aw, man, let's get out of here!"
[OTH],"We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey."
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],(Wait!)
[OTH],What the hell?
[OTH],Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],"Oh uh- hello, children."
Cartman,What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
[OTH],Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.
[OTH],In a sewer?
[OTH],"Children, do you know how to file a police report?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],Good. See you in school.
Cartman,"This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?"
[OTH],"Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?"
Cartman,"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home."
[OTH],Hooowwwdy ho!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey!
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, boys."
[OTH],I told you guys he'd be here!
[OTH],"Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht."
Cartman,"Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh."
[OTH],Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],And usin' dental floss?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],And washin' behind your ears?
[OTH],Yes.
Cartman,No.
[OTH],"What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?"
[OTH],"Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem."
Cartman,Oh my God.
[OTH],"These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment."
[OTH],And that's why you got a cold?
[OTH],"That's why, Kyle. That's why."
[OTH],"Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?"
[OTH],"There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me."
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys."
[OTH],Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!
[OTH],"So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears."
[OTH],"Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?"
[OTH],Is that Leonardo DiCaprio?
[OTH],Aaahh!
[OTH],"Ohuh no, wait, that's not him."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food."
[OTH],"Excuse me, little boy, what's a ""Mr. Hankey""?"
[OTH],"He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide world, and I don't want him to die."
[OTH],What a great story-it has everything!
[OTH],This could be the next Free Willy.
[OTH],"Great pic, son. How much do you want for it?"
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],Does it-uh have to be a talking piece of poo?
[OTH],It could be a crime-fighting rabbit. Or a lovable turtle.
[OTH],This could be a great summer movie.
[OTH],Can we put a mon-key in it?
[OTH],"""The Mr. Hankey Stor-"" uh is Harrison Ford available for a fall pic?"
[OTH],Keanu Reeves.
[OTH],Matt Damon!
[OTH],Fred Savage!
[OTH],I'd pay a million for this story!
[OTH],I'll pay two.
[OTH],"Dude, no one even listened to me."
[OTH],"Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie."
[OTH],"Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right?"
Cartman,"Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess."
[OTH],I want you to do a big-money deal with me.
Cartman,All of us?
[OTH],"Mm-we-hell, I can see that you're the real brains of the group. You don't really need those guys, do you?"
Cartman,"Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them."
[OTH],"Hm-that's great, kid. Let's make a deal."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for making the First Annual South Park Film Festival a success. We've barely even started and already the festival has seen more attendance than last year's Sundance festival."
[OTH],Fantastic!
[OTH],"And I'm very pleased to announce that in honor of the South Park people who have welcomed us, we are going to build a Hollywood Planet restaurant, right here where this library used to stand."
[OTH],Ooohhh!
[OTH],Can they do that?
[OTH],They're Hollywood! They can do anything!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey?!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey?
[OTH],"Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho."
[OTH],"Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?"
[OTH],They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
[OTH],"Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin'."
[OTH],We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
[OTH],Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
[OTH],It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
[OTH],But I won't last long up above.
[OTH],"Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!"
[OTH],"All right, just let me get my toothbrush."
[OTH],"Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!"
[OTH],"Jeez, they made that into a movie already?"
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, I can't go on anymore. I've lost the fight."
[OTH],"No, I'm not leaving without you."
[OTH],"We started this together, we're gonna finish it together."
[OTH],"I always thought death was something glorious, but now I know that it's not."
[OTH],It's going over really well. People are gonna be knocking my door down to get you.
Cartman,Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
[OTH],"I'll always love you, Mr. Hankey."
Cartman,"I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy."
[OTH],"Oh my God, I found a penny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],"Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?"
[OTH],It sure is -dry up here.
[OTH],"Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!"
[OTH],"Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?"
[OTH],Make it quick.
[OTH],"Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town."
[OTH],Uh-huh.
[OTH],"Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?"
[OTH],"We have contracts. You try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. But thanks so much for the hard work."
Cartman,"Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!"
[OTH],"Mmp right. Two million, minus your agent's fee, minus your lawyer's fee, minus my fee, and the publicity and taxes taken out, you get three dollars! That's more than most people in your position make, trust me!"
[OTH],"Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!"
Cartman,I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?
[OTH],"If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!"
[OTH],"It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!"
[OTH],"I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it."
[OTH],So what do we do now?
[OTH],There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
[OTH],"You guys, we have to hurry!"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!
[OTH],Sir! Sir!
[OTH],Not now!
[OTH],I have to show you something.
[OTH],I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
[OTH],What's this?
[OTH],I want you guys to all meet my friend.
[OTH],"That's great, kid. A dried-out lump of shit; very compelling. Okay, folks, let's move! We've gotta have that sign down in time for the opening tonight!"
[OTH],"You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't."
[OTH],Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.
[OTH],Clo-ser.
[OTH],"Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?"
[OTH],There is a-nother Sky-walk-er.
[OTH],Nooohohohohohoho-
[OTH],Wake up.
[OTH],"What is it, Mr. Hankey?"
[OTH],Come clo-ser.
[OTH],What is it?
[OTH],Clo-ser.
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Closer!
[OTH],"One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture."
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
He loved me, I loved you.
Therefore vicariously he loved you-"
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],"I'm sorry, son. Let's get him to ICU."
[OTH],Noo! No!
[OTH],"Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you."
[OTH],"Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie?"
[OTH],Okay!
[OTH],Uuf.
[OTH],"Say, Tom. Do you have any pudding left?"
[OTH],"I ate all mine up, silly."
[OTH],"Well then, now what do we do?"
[OTH],AAWWWW!
[OTH],Eeewww!
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],"Well, why don't we just explore our sexuality?"
[OTH],"Ooh, good idea. Let's."
[OTH],"Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!"
[OTH],Blaach!
[OTH],"Aaww! Is there a problem, young man?"
[OTH],"No problem, dude."
[OTH],I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle. It's time to go."
[OTH],"Chef, does poo go to heaven?"
[OTH],"Well, uh-I kinda hope not."
[OTH],"I mean, sure it does."
[OTH],Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.
[OTH],"Come on, let's go."
[OTH],Kyle.
[OTH],Mr. Hankey?
[OTH],Howdy-ho.
[OTH],He's back! He's back!
[OTH],That was delicious.
[OTH],My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
[OTH],"You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef."
[OTH],You're daaamn right.
Cartman,"Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!"
[OTH],I'll take two.
[OTH],I'd like to pay for one.
Cartman,Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood Planet South Park, that the festival will be back next year!"
[OTH],"And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain!"
[OTH],"I give you, ""Hollywood in South Park!"""
[OTH],Wait!
[OTH],I brought him! I brought him to show you!
[OTH],"Oh, not this again!"
[OTH],Behold! Mr. Hankey!
[OTH],Hoooooowwwdy-ho!
[OTH],"Anyway, this new Hollywood Planet will be the official meeting place for all-"
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival."
[OTH],"Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't hear our chairman. If you could just turn yourself down. You're at about 7 right now, we need you at about, 3, okay?"
[OTH],"Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, ""Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."""
[OTH],I have had enough of you!
[OTH],Nyyaarrrr!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals."
[OTH],O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead.
[OTH],"Well, it worked once before."
[OTH],"Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick!"
[OTH],What the hell is he doing?
[OTH],I don't know.
Cartman,Whoa!
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],Aaaaahh!
[OTH],"Oh, my God, it's crap!"
[OTH],Ohh! Noo!
[OTH],"Whoa, it smells, it smells!"
[OTH],"Come on, let's go! It's coming!"
[OTH],"I'm trying, damn it!"
[OTH],Aww. Aww. Glup.
[OTH],Let's get out of this town!
[OTH],Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength.
[OTH],"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!"
[OTH],"I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle."
[OTH],Kisses.
[OTH],"Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films."
[OTH],"Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you."
[OTH],"Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass."
Cartman,"Yes. And I've learned something, too."
Cartman,"Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home."
[OTH],"Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded."
[OTH],"Because. People from L.A. love to come to a quaint little mountain town for a few days, and this gives them an excuse."
[OTH],"No, this used to be a quaint little mountain town. Now look at it. Sushi restaurants, upscale clothes stores, $25 parking, Liam Neeson... I tell you, Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's resources out. We must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again."
[OTH],That's not a bad idea. But where?
[OTH],Ching ching cha-ching.
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],"Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?"
[OTH],"That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First Annual South Park Film Festival begins today."
[OTH],Wow! Cool!
[OTH],"They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?"
[OTH],"Nono, Kyle. These are independent films."
[OTH],"Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too."
Cartman,"No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding."
[OTH],No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
Cartman,"Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!"
[OTH],"Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!"
Cartman,"I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!"
[OTH],(Gasp)!
[OTH],"Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!"
Cartman,...bitch.
[OTH],"That's it Eric, you-!"
Cartman,I'm going!
[OTH],"Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it."
[OTH],"The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love."
[OTH],"Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer."
[OTH],"Norma, I want to shoot the script next month with Demi Moore instead."
[OTH],Well you can tell Spielberg he can kiss my ass!
[OTH],"Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city."
Cartman,I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
[OTH],She's not my girlfriend.
[OTH],"(Yeah, not when you vomit on her all the time like that.)"
[OTH],"Sick, Kenny."
[OTH],"Damn, dude. Look at all these people."
[OTH],"I'm late for a screening, I'll call you from the theater."
[OTH],All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],Whatcha doin'?
[OTH],"Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!"
Cartman,What kind of cookies?
[OTH],"Calm down, tubby."
[OTH],"They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, ""Fudge 'Ems""."
Cartman,I wanna Fudge 'Em.
[OTH],"I can just see the commercial now. ""Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."""
[OTH],Cool!
[OTH],"And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, ""Fudge This."""
[OTH],"Oh look, one of the natives is selling local food wares... how quaint."
[OTH],"This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture."
[OTH],"Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, ""Go Fudge Yourself,"" or my all-natural, ""I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."""
[OTH],"Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],I would kill for some cous cous right now.
[OTH],Whose goose?
[OTH],"Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A."
[OTH],"Cute sign, though."
[OTH],"Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?"
Cartman,"Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?"
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman! Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway."
Cartman,"She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him."
[OTH],If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
[OTH],"Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! ""I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"""
Cartman,"Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground."
[OTH],When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
[OTH],"Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them."
[OTH],They what?!
[OTH],Who are you to judge my womanly soul?
[OTH],The Goddess flames that burn in my memory aren't dark. Dare you call them dark!
[OTH],Here lies the Goddess truth of my body.
[OTH],"Oh, brother."
[OTH],"The Goddess that cries, ""Freedom!"""
[OTH],Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being
[OTH],"You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door."
[OTH],"Then make love to me, right now"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],Sshh!
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way-"
[OTH],Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
[OTH],"I'm poopies, ma!"
[OTH],"Well, hurry up!"
[OTH],Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
[OTH],Ky-yle! Ky-yle!
[OTH],Could it be?
[OTH],Hooowwwdy ho!
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?"
[OTH],"I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens, except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities."
[OTH],"It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!"
Cartman,"Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime."
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure it was him."
[OTH],"Look, look! Here comes somebody!"
[OTH],"Move aside, I can't see."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage."
[OTH],AAWWWW!
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon."
[OTH],"So how was that movie last night, dude?"
[OTH],"Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!"
Cartman,"It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?"
[OTH],"Yeah, pretty much."
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],"The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen."
[OTH],Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass.
Cartman,Ay!
[OTH],"Yeah, but that'd be like IMAX."
Cartman,"Okay, that's enough fat-ass jokes for this week."
[OTH],"(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh.)"
Cartman,"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home."
[OTH],Well?
Cartman,"I'm gonna, just give me a minute."
[OTH],"This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into."
[OTH],"Forgive me for being observant, but, won't we just end up doing the same thing to this town?"
[OTH],"Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles."
[OTH],Why? Why would we do such a thing?
[OTH],"Because we have to live in L.A. And if we can't live in quiet, simple, peaceful mountain towns, then nobody will!"
[OTH],Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will!
[OTH],That's it.
[OTH],"Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, ""Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls."""
[OTH],Are they good?
[OTH],Try 'em.
[OTH],"Hey, dude, these are good!"
Cartman,"Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef."
[OTH],Ky-yle!
[OTH],There it is again!
[OTH],There is what again?
[OTH],Ky-yle!
[OTH],It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble.
[OTH],"Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?"
[OTH],Where does that grill go?
[OTH],"To the sewer, dude."
[OTH],"Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!"
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],"Hey, everybody,
have you seen my balls?
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up,
just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em..."
Cartman,"Aw, man, smells like ass down here."
[OTH],"Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer!"
[OTH],What was that?
Cartman,"Aw, man, let's get out of here!"
[OTH],"We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey."
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],(Wait!)
[OTH],What the hell?
[OTH],Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],"Oh uh- hello, children."
Cartman,What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
[OTH],Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.
[OTH],In a sewer?
[OTH],"Children, do you know how to file a police report?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],Good. See you in school.
Cartman,"This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?"
[OTH],"Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?"
Cartman,"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home."
[OTH],Hooowwwdy ho!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey!
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, boys."
[OTH],I told you guys he'd be here!
[OTH],"Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht."
Cartman,"Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh."
[OTH],Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],And usin' dental floss?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],And washin' behind your ears?
[OTH],Yes.
Cartman,No.
[OTH],"What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?"
[OTH],"Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem."
Cartman,Oh my God.
[OTH],"These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment."
[OTH],And that's why you got a cold?
[OTH],"That's why, Kyle. That's why."
[OTH],"Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?"
[OTH],"There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me."
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys."
[OTH],Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!
[OTH],"So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears."
[OTH],"Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?"
[OTH],Is that Leonardo DiCaprio?
[OTH],Aaahh!
[OTH],"Ohuh no, wait, that's not him."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food."
[OTH],"Excuse me, little boy, what's a ""Mr. Hankey""?"
[OTH],"He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide world, and I don't want him to die."
[OTH],What a great story-it has everything!
[OTH],This could be the next Free Willy.
[OTH],"Great pic, son. How much do you want for it?"
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],Does it-uh have to be a talking piece of poo?
[OTH],It could be a crime-fighting rabbit. Or a lovable turtle.
[OTH],This could be a great summer movie.
[OTH],Can we put a mon-key in it?
[OTH],"""The Mr. Hankey Stor-"" uh is Harrison Ford available for a fall pic?"
[OTH],Keanu Reeves.
[OTH],Matt Damon!
[OTH],Fred Savage!
[OTH],I'd pay a million for this story!
[OTH],I'll pay two.
[OTH],"Dude, no one even listened to me."
[OTH],"Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie."
[OTH],"Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right?"
Cartman,"Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess."
[OTH],I want you to do a big-money deal with me.
Cartman,All of us?
[OTH],"Mm-we-hell, I can see that you're the real brains of the group. You don't really need those guys, do you?"
Cartman,"Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them."
[OTH],"Hm-that's great, kid. Let's make a deal."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for making the First Annual South Park Film Festival a success. We've barely even started and already the festival has seen more attendance than last year's Sundance festival."
[OTH],Fantastic!
[OTH],"And I'm very pleased to announce that in honor of the South Park people who have welcomed us, we are going to build a Hollywood Planet restaurant, right here where this library used to stand."
[OTH],Ooohhh!
[OTH],Can they do that?
[OTH],They're Hollywood! They can do anything!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey?!
[OTH],Mr. Hankey?
[OTH],"Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho."
[OTH],"Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?"
[OTH],They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
[OTH],"Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin'."
[OTH],We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
[OTH],Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
[OTH],It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
[OTH],But I won't last long up above.
[OTH],"Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!"
[OTH],"All right, just let me get my toothbrush."
[OTH],"Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!"
[OTH],"Jeez, they made that into a movie already?"
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, I can't go on anymore. I've lost the fight."
[OTH],"No, I'm not leaving without you."
[OTH],"We started this together, we're gonna finish it together."
[OTH],"I always thought death was something glorious, but now I know that it's not."
[OTH],It's going over really well. People are gonna be knocking my door down to get you.
Cartman,Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
[OTH],"I'll always love you, Mr. Hankey."
Cartman,"I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy."
[OTH],"Oh my God, I found a penny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],"Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?"
[OTH],It sure is -dry up here.
[OTH],"Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!"
[OTH],"Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?"
[OTH],Make it quick.
[OTH],"Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town."
[OTH],Uh-huh.
[OTH],"Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?"
[OTH],"We have contracts. You try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. But thanks so much for the hard work."
Cartman,"Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!"
[OTH],"Mmp right. Two million, minus your agent's fee, minus your lawyer's fee, minus my fee, and the publicity and taxes taken out, you get three dollars! That's more than most people in your position make, trust me!"
[OTH],"Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!"
Cartman,I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?
[OTH],"If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!"
[OTH],"It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!"
[OTH],"I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it."
[OTH],So what do we do now?
[OTH],There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
[OTH],"You guys, we have to hurry!"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!
[OTH],Sir! Sir!
[OTH],Not now!
[OTH],I have to show you something.
[OTH],I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
[OTH],What's this?
[OTH],I want you guys to all meet my friend.
[OTH],"That's great, kid. A dried-out lump of shit; very compelling. Okay, folks, let's move! We've gotta have that sign down in time for the opening tonight!"
[OTH],"You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't."
[OTH],Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.
[OTH],Clo-ser.
[OTH],"Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?"
[OTH],There is a-nother Sky-walk-er.
[OTH],Nooohohohohohoho-
[OTH],Wake up.
[OTH],"What is it, Mr. Hankey?"
[OTH],Come clo-ser.
[OTH],What is it?
[OTH],Clo-ser.
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Closer!
[OTH],"One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture."
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
He loved me, I loved you.
Therefore vicariously he loved you-"
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],"I'm sorry, son. Let's get him to ICU."
[OTH],Noo! No!
[OTH],"Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you."
[OTH],"Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie?"
[OTH],Okay!
[OTH],Uuf.
[OTH],"Say, Tom. Do you have any pudding left?"
[OTH],"I ate all mine up, silly."
[OTH],"Well then, now what do we do?"
[OTH],AAWWWW!
[OTH],Eeewww!
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],"Well, why don't we just explore our sexuality?"
[OTH],"Ooh, good idea. Let's."
[OTH],"Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!"
[OTH],Blaach!
[OTH],"Aaww! Is there a problem, young man?"
[OTH],"No problem, dude."
[OTH],I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle. It's time to go."
[OTH],"Chef, does poo go to heaven?"
[OTH],"Well, uh-I kinda hope not."
[OTH],"I mean, sure it does."
[OTH],Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.
[OTH],"Come on, let's go."
[OTH],Kyle.
[OTH],Mr. Hankey?
[OTH],Howdy-ho.
[OTH],He's back! He's back!
[OTH],That was delicious.
[OTH],My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
[OTH],"You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef."
[OTH],You're daaamn right.
Cartman,"Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!"
[OTH],I'll take two.
[OTH],I'd like to pay for one.
Cartman,Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood Planet South Park, that the festival will be back next year!"
[OTH],"And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain!"
[OTH],"I give you, ""Hollywood in South Park!"""
[OTH],Wait!
[OTH],I brought him! I brought him to show you!
[OTH],"Oh, not this again!"
[OTH],Behold! Mr. Hankey!
[OTH],Hoooooowwwdy-ho!
[OTH],"Anyway, this new Hollywood Planet will be the official meeting place for all-"
[OTH],"Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival."
[OTH],"Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't hear our chairman. If you could just turn yourself down. You're at about 7 right now, we need you at about, 3, okay?"
[OTH],"Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, ""Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."""
[OTH],I have had enough of you!
[OTH],Nyyaarrrr!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals."
[OTH],O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead.
[OTH],"Well, it worked once before."
[OTH],"Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick!"
[OTH],What the hell is he doing?
[OTH],I don't know.
Cartman,Whoa!
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],Aaaaahh!
[OTH],"Oh, my God, it's crap!"
[OTH],Ohh! Noo!
[OTH],"Whoa, it smells, it smells!"
[OTH],"Come on, let's go! It's coming!"
[OTH],"I'm trying, damn it!"
[OTH],Aww. Aww. Glup.
[OTH],Let's get out of this town!
[OTH],Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength.
[OTH],"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!"
[OTH],"I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle."
[OTH],Kisses.
[OTH],"Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films."
[OTH],"Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you."
[OTH],"Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass."
Cartman,"Yes. And I've learned something, too."
Cartman,"Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home."
[OTH],It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.
[OTH],But what's wrong with her?
[OTH],"It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?"
[OTH],"No, no, she's been perfectly healthy."
[OTH],"Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease."
[OTH],"Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan."
[OTH],"Oh, whoo-peee!"
[OTH],"You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes."
[OTH],"Dude, you've got herpes on your face!"
[OTH],"Shut up, brat!"
[OTH],Will my daughter be okay?
[OTH],She'll be fine.
[OTH],Stop it!
[OTH],We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go."
[OTH],"...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die."
[OTH],"My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness."
[OTH],I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
[OTH],"So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young."
[OTH],"That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time."
[OTH],"Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it."
[OTH],So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
[OTH],"Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now."
[OTH],Are you guys having a meeting or something?
[OTH],How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
Cartman,"No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto."
[OTH],Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
[OTH],"Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final."
Cartman,Oh weak!
[OTH],I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
[OTH],"Yeah, it's pretty weird."
[OTH],"Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo."
[OTH],"Well, here's Kenny's house."
Cartman,"In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto"
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
[OTH],What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?
[OTH],"That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young."
[OTH],Oh yeah.
[OTH],Catch what?
[OTH],"Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner."
Cartman,"And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto"
[OTH],Sshh! Cartman!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!"
[OTH],"(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)"
[OTH],I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
[OTH],"Heheheh, buns."
[OTH],"(Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!"
Cartman,Where is the Nintendo?
[OTH],We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.
[OTH],Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
[OTH],Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
Cartman,"Oh, good. I'm starving."
[OTH],Let's say grace.
[OTH],"Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen."
[OTH],Amen.
Cartman,Pfff..!
[OTH],"Okay, let's dig in."
[OTH],"That one's mine, that one's mine!"
Cartman,What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?
Cartman,Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
[OTH],"So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"Stuart, don't even get started!"
[OTH],"What? I'm just askin' a question. You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!"
Cartman,Puh! I heard that.
[OTH],"That ain't why, Stuart! It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night!"
[OTH],"Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!"
[OTH],"What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!"
[OTH],You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
[OTH],"My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!"
[OTH],"Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother."
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?"
[OTH],"Hey! We don't say ""fuck"" at the table, you little asshole!"
Cartman,"Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either."
[OTH],(Aa-choo!)
[OTH],"Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],(Waa-choo!)
Cartman,Ey!
Cartman,"Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?"
[OTH],Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell is that?"
Cartman,It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
[OTH],"No, it's not cool!"
[OTH],"Dude, I think I just saw a rat!"
Cartman,"Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!"
[OTH],(Uh-huh.)
Cartman,"Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha."
[OTH],I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
[OTH],"(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],(Aa-choo!)
[OTH],"Okay, lemme see."
[OTH],"Oh, goody! You've got a fever!"
[OTH],"Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!"
[OTH],"Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright."
[OTH],"Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night."
[OTH],"Oh, gee, I guess you did."
[OTH],"Well, you sure seem happy about it!"
[OTH],"All right, it's off to bed with you, young man."
[OTH],"Don't scratch it, hon."
Cartman,"But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!"
[OTH],"No, hon."
Cartman,"Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!"
[OTH],"Here, I got you some calamine lotion."
Cartman,I don't wanna.
[OTH],It'll make your itches go away.
Cartman,Ugh. Uunnh.
Cartman,"Ey, give me that!"
Cartman,Ahhhh...
[OTH],"Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad."
Cartman,More calamine lotion!
[OTH],I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.
[OTH],Yeah. I feel great!
[OTH],Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast."
[OTH],Did you sleep in the same room?
[OTH],Yes. Why?
[OTH],"Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?"
[OTH],"No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!"
[OTH],Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
[OTH],"Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him."
[OTH],I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.
[OTH],Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
[OTH],"Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were."
[OTH],"Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?"
[OTH],"Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do."
[OTH],"But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?"
[OTH],"Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son."
[OTH],"You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods."
[OTH],Gods and clods?
[OTH],"Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down."
[OTH],"Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!"
[OTH],"That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America."
[OTH],"Stanley, can I get you anything else?"
[OTH],"Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!"
[OTH],"Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay."
[OTH],Can I talk to you outside?
[OTH],"Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Serves you right, you little brat!"
[OTH],Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
[OTH],"If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!"
[OTH],Will Carol find out she's a fa...
[OTH],I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
[OTH],We're watching this!
[OTH],"Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha."
[OTH],"Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?"
[OTH],"Sure thing, Phillip."
[OTH],"Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!"
[OTH],That's tomfoolery.
[OTH],Give me the remote!
[OTH],"No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day--"
[OTH],Ey! Get me out of here!
[OTH],She was...
[OTH],"He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while."
[OTH],"Oh God, what have we done?"
[OTH],"There there now, it's not your fault."
[OTH],"Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early."
[OTH],"Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck."
[OTH],"Could we go home now, Ma?"
[OTH],"No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more."
[OTH],But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
[OTH],"I've got a great game for you. It's called ""ookie mouth""."
[OTH],"What's ""ookie mouth""?"
[OTH],"First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say ""ookie mouth"" at the same time."
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
[OTH],"No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it."
[OTH],That ought to take care of it.
[OTH],You want some more hot water?
[OTH],"Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?"
[OTH],"Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity rich folk stuff."
[OTH],"I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick."
[OTH],"Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
[OTH],"Ookie mouth! Gross! I can't do it, Ma!"
[OTH],"Try again, bubbe!"
[OTH],Argh!
[OTH],"You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers."
[OTH],Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
[OTH],"Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?"
[OTH],"Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself."
[OTH],Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
[OTH],"Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd."
[OTH],But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
[OTH],Uh-I don't know.
[OTH],We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
[OTH],"I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible."
[OTH],"Practice makes perfect, bubbe."
Cartman,"Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!"
[OTH],"Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news."
[OTH],"Give it to me straight, Terrance."
[OTH],"The good news is, you have a clean bill of health."
[OTH],"Oh, what a relief!"
[OTH],"The bad news is, you have cancer."
[OTH],Cancer?
[OTH],Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.
[OTH],My ass is collapsing?
[OTH],Yes. See this X-ray? That's your ass. See this line? That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
[OTH],Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
[OTH],"No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore."
Cartman,"Oh, no. Damnit!"
Cartman,"No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!"
Cartman,Uh. Yes. Uh...
[OTH],"I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion."
Cartman,It's about friggin' time! Give me that!
[OTH],"Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while."
Cartman,"Uugh! Yeessss. Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh..."
[OTH],"I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh..."
[OTH],Tackle box?
[OTH],"Yeah, tackle box. Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?"
[OTH],"When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless."
[OTH],Right. Right-right.
[OTH],"And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?"
[OTH],"Yes, Kyle?"
[OTH],What the hell does that have to do with American history?
[OTH],"Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes."
[OTH],"Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, ""How I would make America better."""
[OTH],"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?"
[OTH],"Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too."
[OTH],Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
[OTH],"Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick."
[OTH],That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
[OTH],"Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good."
[OTH],"Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's-it's true, he is."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper."
[OTH],Wait! Where are you going?
[OTH],We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
[OTH],Milkshakes?!
[OTH],"Yeah, and then we're going to the movies."
[OTH],"See ya, son."
[OTH],Weak!
[OTH],"""So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."""
[OTH],"No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy."
[OTH],He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it."
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?"
[OTH],You!
[OTH],"I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz."
[OTH],You!
[OTH],"What, bubbeleh, what is it?"
[OTH],You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
[OTH],"Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young."
[OTH],"Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!"
[OTH],"Now, Kyle, come here."
[OTH],"You get away from me, you crazy woman!"
[OTH],Hoh boy.
[OTH],Beer?
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries."
[OTH],"Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?"
[OTH],Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
[OTH],Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
[OTH],That's where I live now.
[OTH],"Oh, right."
[OTH],And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
[OTH],Stan! Stan!
[OTH],Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
[OTH],"Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
[OTH],What are you talking about?
[OTH],"They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway."
[OTH],They did?
[OTH],Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Because they're a bunch of assholes.
[OTH],Of course!
[OTH],"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!"
Cartman,"""I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."""
Cartman,"Mom, answer that! ""They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."""
[OTH],"Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?"
Cartman,I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
[OTH],"Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face."
Cartman,She what?!
[OTH],It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
Cartman,That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
[OTH],"No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back."
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along."
[OTH],Not that easy. You were lucky.
[OTH],"Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky."
[OTH],You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
[OTH],Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today! I wanted to be somebody!
[OTH],"I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!"
[OTH],"You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!"
[OTH],Ow!!
[OTH],Now don't make me do that again!
[OTH],Ow! You son of a bitch!
[OTH],Uh!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Eeaagghh!
[OTH],Huuuh!
[OTH],Doctor?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Wh-where's Stan?
[OTH],Stan?
[OTH],"Stan, our son?"
[OTH],"Oh, yes. Where is Stan?"
[OTH],You mean Stanley's missing?
[OTH],"No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment."
[OTH],Oh my God! Our son ran away!
[OTH],Will he be okay out of the hospital?
[OTH],"Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die."
[OTH],Die?
[OTH],"Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs."
[OTH],"Okay, well well, let's go look--"
[OTH],"As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny."
[OTH],"Oh God, no!"
[OTH],I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
[OTH],"Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--"
[OTH],So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
[OTH],That son of a bitch ripped my parka!
[OTH],Catch anything?
[OTH],I just don't get it.
[OTH],Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
[OTH],"Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up."
[OTH],What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
[OTH],I thought it would be good for you.
[OTH],Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
[OTH],I'm doing the best I can!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Oh, God, what have I done?"
[OTH],"What's happening here, Terrance?"
[OTH],We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
[OTH],Who's the donor?
[OTH],"I am, Phillip. I am."
[OTH],"Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?"
[OTH],"Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass."
[OTH],"Oh, damn it, not now!"
[OTH],"Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!"
[OTH],"Chef, we wanna know about herpes."
[OTH],What makes you think I would know anything about that?
[OTH],Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
[OTH],How does someone get herpes?
[OTH],Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
[OTH],Do you know anybody with herpes?
[OTH],"Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her."
[OTH],But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
[OTH],"Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to."
[OTH],"Cool! Thanks, Chef!"
[OTH],O-kay!
[OTH],Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
[OTH],Stanley?
[OTH],Stan?
[OTH],"Oh, Stanley, where are you..?"
[OTH],Stan?
[OTH],Stanley!
[OTH],Are you old Frida?
[OTH],Who wants to know?
[OTH],Someone who wants a favor.
[OTH],"Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b--"
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,We want you to give our parents herpes.
[OTH],Five dollars.
[OTH],My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser.
[OTH],"Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital."
[OTH],"And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do."
[OTH],"Thanks a lot, Frida!"
[OTH],Don't mention it.
[OTH],"D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Stanley, where the hell have you been?"
[OTH],"Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!"
[OTH],I don't wanna go back there.
[OTH],"Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital."
[OTH],Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"You know, freshen up your breath."
[OTH],"Aw, man. I don't feel so good."
[OTH],"Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--"
[OTH],Ugh...
[OTH],Kyle!!
[OTH],"Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all."
[OTH],We're sorry.
[OTH],"Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in."
[OTH],"This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman."
Cartman,"Hell no, you guys get your own!"
[OTH],"Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?"
[OTH],Pretty good.
[OTH],The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
[OTH],"Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?"
[OTH],"Wow, coo-hul!"
[OTH],"And how are you, Kyle?"
[OTH],Are you doing okay?
[OTH],I'm better now.
[OTH],"What's so funny, you two?"
[OTH],We gave you guys herpes.
[OTH],What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!
[OTH],We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
[OTH],I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
[OTH],"Well, I guess it serves us right. Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox."
[OTH],It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it.
Cartman,"Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?"
[OTH],"Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins."
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],"And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me."
[OTH],"Aww hell, I'm sorry, too."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better."
Cartman,"Well, I know one thing for sure."
[OTH],"What's that, Eric?"
Cartman,We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.
[OTH],But what's wrong with her?
[OTH],"It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?"
[OTH],"No, no, she's been perfectly healthy."
[OTH],"Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease."
[OTH],"Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan."
[OTH],"Oh, whoo-peee!"
[OTH],"You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes."
[OTH],"Dude, you've got herpes on your face!"
[OTH],"Shut up, brat!"
[OTH],Will my daughter be okay?
[OTH],She'll be fine.
[OTH],Stop it!
[OTH],We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go."
[OTH],"...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die."
[OTH],"My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness."
[OTH],I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
[OTH],"So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young."
[OTH],"That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time."
[OTH],"Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it."
[OTH],So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
[OTH],"Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now."
[OTH],Are you guys having a meeting or something?
[OTH],How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
Cartman,"No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto."
[OTH],Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
[OTH],"Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final."
Cartman,Oh weak!
[OTH],I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
[OTH],"Yeah, it's pretty weird."
[OTH],"Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo."
[OTH],"Well, here's Kenny's house."
Cartman,"In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto"
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
[OTH],What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?
[OTH],"That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young."
[OTH],Oh yeah.
[OTH],Catch what?
[OTH],"Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner."
Cartman,"And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto"
[OTH],Sshh! Cartman!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!"
[OTH],"(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)"
[OTH],I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
[OTH],"Heheheh, buns."
[OTH],"(Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!"
Cartman,Where is the Nintendo?
[OTH],We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.
[OTH],Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
[OTH],Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
Cartman,"Oh, good. I'm starving."
[OTH],Let's say grace.
[OTH],"Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen."
[OTH],Amen.
Cartman,Pfff..!
[OTH],"Okay, let's dig in."
[OTH],"That one's mine, that one's mine!"
Cartman,What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?
Cartman,Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
[OTH],"So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"Stuart, don't even get started!"
[OTH],"What? I'm just askin' a question. You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!"
Cartman,Puh! I heard that.
[OTH],"That ain't why, Stuart! It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night!"
[OTH],"Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!"
[OTH],"What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!"
[OTH],You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
[OTH],"My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!"
[OTH],"Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother."
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?"
[OTH],"Hey! We don't say ""fuck"" at the table, you little asshole!"
Cartman,"Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either."
[OTH],(Aa-choo!)
[OTH],"Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],(Waa-choo!)
Cartman,Ey!
Cartman,"Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?"
[OTH],Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell is that?"
Cartman,It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
[OTH],"No, it's not cool!"
[OTH],"Dude, I think I just saw a rat!"
Cartman,"Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!"
[OTH],(Uh-huh.)
Cartman,"Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha."
[OTH],I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
[OTH],"(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],(Aa-choo!)
[OTH],"Okay, lemme see."
[OTH],"Oh, goody! You've got a fever!"
[OTH],"Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!"
[OTH],"Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright."
[OTH],"Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night."
[OTH],"Oh, gee, I guess you did."
[OTH],"Well, you sure seem happy about it!"
[OTH],"All right, it's off to bed with you, young man."
[OTH],"Don't scratch it, hon."
Cartman,"But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!"
[OTH],"No, hon."
Cartman,"Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!"
[OTH],"Here, I got you some calamine lotion."
Cartman,I don't wanna.
[OTH],It'll make your itches go away.
Cartman,Ugh. Uunnh.
Cartman,"Ey, give me that!"
Cartman,Ahhhh...
[OTH],"Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad."
Cartman,More calamine lotion!
[OTH],I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.
[OTH],Yeah. I feel great!
[OTH],Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast."
[OTH],Did you sleep in the same room?
[OTH],Yes. Why?
[OTH],"Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?"
[OTH],"No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!"
[OTH],Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
[OTH],"Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him."
[OTH],I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.
[OTH],Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
[OTH],"Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were."
[OTH],"Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?"
[OTH],"Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do."
[OTH],"But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?"
[OTH],"Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son."
[OTH],"You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods."
[OTH],Gods and clods?
[OTH],"Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down."
[OTH],"Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!"
[OTH],"That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America."
[OTH],"Stanley, can I get you anything else?"
[OTH],"Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!"
[OTH],"Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay."
[OTH],Can I talk to you outside?
[OTH],"Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Serves you right, you little brat!"
[OTH],Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
[OTH],"If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!"
[OTH],Will Carol find out she's a fa...
[OTH],I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
[OTH],We're watching this!
[OTH],"Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha."
[OTH],"Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?"
[OTH],"Sure thing, Phillip."
[OTH],"Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!"
[OTH],That's tomfoolery.
[OTH],Give me the remote!
[OTH],"No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day--"
[OTH],Ey! Get me out of here!
[OTH],She was...
[OTH],"He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while."
[OTH],"Oh God, what have we done?"
[OTH],"There there now, it's not your fault."
[OTH],"Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early."
[OTH],"Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck."
[OTH],"Could we go home now, Ma?"
[OTH],"No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more."
[OTH],But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
[OTH],"I've got a great game for you. It's called ""ookie mouth""."
[OTH],"What's ""ookie mouth""?"
[OTH],"First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say ""ookie mouth"" at the same time."
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
[OTH],"No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it."
[OTH],That ought to take care of it.
[OTH],You want some more hot water?
[OTH],"Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?"
[OTH],"Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity rich folk stuff."
[OTH],"I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick."
[OTH],"Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
[OTH],"Ookie mouth! Gross! I can't do it, Ma!"
[OTH],"Try again, bubbe!"
[OTH],Argh!
[OTH],"You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers."
[OTH],Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
[OTH],"Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?"
[OTH],"Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself."
[OTH],Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
[OTH],"Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd."
[OTH],But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
[OTH],Uh-I don't know.
[OTH],We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
[OTH],"I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible."
[OTH],"Practice makes perfect, bubbe."
Cartman,"Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!"
[OTH],"Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news."
[OTH],"Give it to me straight, Terrance."
[OTH],"The good news is, you have a clean bill of health."
[OTH],"Oh, what a relief!"
[OTH],"The bad news is, you have cancer."
[OTH],Cancer?
[OTH],Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.
[OTH],My ass is collapsing?
[OTH],Yes. See this X-ray? That's your ass. See this line? That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
[OTH],Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
[OTH],"No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore."
Cartman,"Oh, no. Damnit!"
Cartman,"No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!"
Cartman,Uh. Yes. Uh...
[OTH],"I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion."
Cartman,It's about friggin' time! Give me that!
[OTH],"Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while."
Cartman,"Uugh! Yeessss. Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh..."
[OTH],"I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh..."
[OTH],Tackle box?
[OTH],"Yeah, tackle box. Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?"
[OTH],"When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless."
[OTH],Right. Right-right.
[OTH],"And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?"
[OTH],"Yes, Kyle?"
[OTH],What the hell does that have to do with American history?
[OTH],"Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes."
[OTH],"Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, ""How I would make America better."""
[OTH],"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?"
[OTH],"Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too."
[OTH],Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
[OTH],"Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick."
[OTH],That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
[OTH],"Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good."
[OTH],"Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's-it's true, he is."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper."
[OTH],Wait! Where are you going?
[OTH],We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
[OTH],Milkshakes?!
[OTH],"Yeah, and then we're going to the movies."
[OTH],"See ya, son."
[OTH],Weak!
[OTH],"""So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."""
[OTH],"No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy."
[OTH],He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it."
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?"
[OTH],You!
[OTH],"I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz."
[OTH],You!
[OTH],"What, bubbeleh, what is it?"
[OTH],You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
[OTH],"Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young."
[OTH],"Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!"
[OTH],"Now, Kyle, come here."
[OTH],"You get away from me, you crazy woman!"
[OTH],Hoh boy.
[OTH],Beer?
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries."
[OTH],"Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?"
[OTH],Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
[OTH],Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
[OTH],That's where I live now.
[OTH],"Oh, right."
[OTH],And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
[OTH],Stan! Stan!
[OTH],Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
[OTH],"Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
[OTH],What are you talking about?
[OTH],"They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway."
[OTH],They did?
[OTH],Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Because they're a bunch of assholes.
[OTH],Of course!
[OTH],"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!"
Cartman,"""I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."""
Cartman,"Mom, answer that! ""They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."""
[OTH],"Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?"
Cartman,I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
[OTH],"Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face."
Cartman,She what?!
[OTH],It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
Cartman,That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
[OTH],"No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back."
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along."
[OTH],Not that easy. You were lucky.
[OTH],"Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky."
[OTH],You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
[OTH],Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today! I wanted to be somebody!
[OTH],"I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!"
[OTH],"You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!"
[OTH],Ow!!
[OTH],Now don't make me do that again!
[OTH],Ow! You son of a bitch!
[OTH],Uh!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Eeaagghh!
[OTH],Huuuh!
[OTH],Doctor?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Wh-where's Stan?
[OTH],Stan?
[OTH],"Stan, our son?"
[OTH],"Oh, yes. Where is Stan?"
[OTH],You mean Stanley's missing?
[OTH],"No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment."
[OTH],Oh my God! Our son ran away!
[OTH],Will he be okay out of the hospital?
[OTH],"Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die."
[OTH],Die?
[OTH],"Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs."
[OTH],"Okay, well well, let's go look--"
[OTH],"As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny."
[OTH],"Oh God, no!"
[OTH],I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
[OTH],"Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--"
[OTH],So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
[OTH],That son of a bitch ripped my parka!
[OTH],Catch anything?
[OTH],I just don't get it.
[OTH],Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
[OTH],"Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up."
[OTH],What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
[OTH],I thought it would be good for you.
[OTH],Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
[OTH],I'm doing the best I can!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Oh, God, what have I done?"
[OTH],"What's happening here, Terrance?"
[OTH],We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
[OTH],Who's the donor?
[OTH],"I am, Phillip. I am."
[OTH],"Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?"
[OTH],"Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass."
[OTH],"Oh, damn it, not now!"
[OTH],"Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!"
[OTH],"Chef, we wanna know about herpes."
[OTH],What makes you think I would know anything about that?
[OTH],Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
[OTH],How does someone get herpes?
[OTH],Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
[OTH],Do you know anybody with herpes?
[OTH],"Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her."
[OTH],But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
[OTH],"Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to."
[OTH],"Cool! Thanks, Chef!"
[OTH],O-kay!
[OTH],Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
[OTH],Stanley?
[OTH],Stan?
[OTH],"Oh, Stanley, where are you..?"
[OTH],Stan?
[OTH],Stanley!
[OTH],Are you old Frida?
[OTH],Who wants to know?
[OTH],Someone who wants a favor.
[OTH],"Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b--"
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,We want you to give our parents herpes.
[OTH],Five dollars.
[OTH],My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser.
[OTH],"Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital."
[OTH],"And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do."
[OTH],"Thanks a lot, Frida!"
[OTH],Don't mention it.
[OTH],"D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Stanley, where the hell have you been?"
[OTH],"Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!"
[OTH],I don't wanna go back there.
[OTH],"Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital."
[OTH],Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"You know, freshen up your breath."
[OTH],"Aw, man. I don't feel so good."
[OTH],"Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--"
[OTH],Ugh...
[OTH],Kyle!!
[OTH],"Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all."
[OTH],We're sorry.
[OTH],"Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in."
[OTH],"This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman."
Cartman,"Hell no, you guys get your own!"
[OTH],"Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?"
[OTH],Pretty good.
[OTH],The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
[OTH],"Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?"
[OTH],"Wow, coo-hul!"
[OTH],"And how are you, Kyle?"
[OTH],Are you doing okay?
[OTH],I'm better now.
[OTH],"What's so funny, you two?"
[OTH],We gave you guys herpes.
[OTH],What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!
[OTH],We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
[OTH],I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
[OTH],"Well, I guess it serves us right. Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox."
[OTH],It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it.
Cartman,"Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?"
[OTH],"Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins."
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],"And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me."
[OTH],"Aww hell, I'm sorry, too."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better."
Cartman,"Well, I know one thing for sure."
[OTH],"What's that, Eric?"
Cartman,We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Well, detective. It looks like ya fooled them again."
[OTH],"All in a day's work, I guess. I just hope that next time, I won't have to run so much."
[OTH],"Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, ""This is not a victimless crime""? Anybody? Children, were you paying attention?!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention."
[OTH],"Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?"
[OTH],Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
[OTH],"Oh, and what do you consider normal?!"
[OTH],"I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],To where?
[OTH],To the planetarium.
[OTH],AAWWWW!
Cartman,Planetariums suck!
[OTH],"Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium?"
[OTH],It's boring.
[OTH],"Yeah, all the constellations look alike."
[OTH],"Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege."
[OTH],Aawwww.
[OTH],"Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials."
[OTH],"Hey kids, do you love Cheesy Poofs?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Well, Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy Cheesy Poofs song. Watch for our talent van as it goes around the country."
Cartman,I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
[OTH],"If you win, you could be picked to be in our next Cheesy Poofs commercial. So remember,

I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame."
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road."
[OTH],THAT AIN'T HOW YOU DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!!
[OTH],"Ow! Jesus, lady!"
[OTH],"THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF!"
[OTH],Ow.
[OTH],"Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves."
[OTH],Does your child have what it takes to be the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer?
Cartman,"Hey, there it is!"
[OTH],We're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the Cheesy Poofs song better than anybody.
Cartman,I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back!
[OTH],"You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!"
[OTH],"Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium."
Cartman,But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
[OTH],"No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on!"
Cartman,But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
[OTH],"Wow, don't you...?"
[OTH],What is that?
[OTH],"Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium."
[OTH],I thought it was planetarium.
[OTH],"Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the ""t"" in ""plane'arium""."
[OTH],That's a pretty weird bone disease.
[OTH],Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.
[OTH],"Yes, little boy?"
Cartman,How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside?
[OTH],"Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works."
Cartman,As if we care.
[OTH],"Hey, who are you?"
[OTH],"Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us."
[OTH],I love my work.
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?"
[OTH],I love my work.
[OTH],"Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?"
[OTH],"Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable."
[OTH],This is stupid.
[OTH],And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... eh-come out.
[OTH],Whoopie.
[OTH],"Here we see the constellation called, ""The Big Dipper"". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it... a-hah ...we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull..."
[OTH],"...while these stars form the constellation, ""Roger Ebert""."
[OTH],And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades.
[OTH],"Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of..."
Cartman,"Aw man, screw this."
[OTH],And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.
[OTH],"I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that."
[OTH],"...you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame."
[OTH],"That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner."
Cartman,"Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!"
[OTH],"Oh, and what's your name, little boy?"
Cartman,Eric Cartman.
[OTH],"Alright, here's Eric Cartman giving it a shot."
[OTH],Aaah!
Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs
you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs
we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!"
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,"Thaat's right, suck on that."
[OTH],"Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?"
[OTH],"Oh, man, I don't feel so good."
[OTH],"Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium."
[OTH],Me too. It was sweet.
[OTH],Really? What did you like best about it?
[OTH],I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
[OTH],Wait a minute. Where is Eric?
Cartman,I did it! I did it!
[OTH],Did what?
Cartman,I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
[OTH],You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
Cartman,"Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!"
[OTH],"Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor."
[OTH],My head still feels funny.
[OTH],"Yeah, mine too."
Cartman,"Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want."
[OTH],"Like you really need it, hippo-ass!"
Cartman,"It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is."
[OTH],Waaaah!
[OTH],AAAAAH!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!"
[OTH],My... name... is... vvan... G-gelder.
[OTH],"Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!"
[OTH],"Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!"
[OTH],Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno!
Cartman,"Hey, be careful, asshole!"
[OTH],Eegh! Don't take me back there!
[OTH],I can't... can't...
[OTH],"Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!"
[OTH],Aaaagghh.
[OTH],"We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!"
[OTH],Aagh! The planetarium! Haah!
[OTH],I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.
[OTH],Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay!
[OTH],Okay uh van Gelder-
[OTH],Nnnaaaah!
[OTH],"-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?"
[OTH],Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh-
[OTH],"Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?"
[OTH],"Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium."
[OTH],Haah! Planetarium!
[OTH],I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
[OTH],Nnaaah!
[OTH],"Oh, man, this is boring!"
[OTH],"Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting?"
[OTH],"Dude, this is totally killer."
[OTH],"I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man."
[OTH],You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.
[OTH],Incredible pain!
[OTH],Incredible icky paaiin!
[OTH],"Dude, I'm totally tripping."
[OTH],This is totally killer.
[OTH],"Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?"
[OTH],That's a haiku?
[OTH],"No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Was he on the school bus this morning?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd."
[OTH],"Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?"
[OTH],"(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)"
[OTH],Yeah. What's a discharge?
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?"
[OTH],"Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too."
[OTH],But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
[OTH],"Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?"
[OTH],I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
[OTH],"Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street."
Cartman,"Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams."
[OTH],"Eric, where have you been?"
Cartman,"Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?"
[OTH],"Where have you been, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship!"
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,"This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it? Hey, where is your regional championship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?"
Cartman,"Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?"
Cartman,"Apparently, only I do."
[OTH],"Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too."
Cartman,"Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion."
[OTH],Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
Cartman,It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
[OTH],"I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV."
[OTH],"Very good, Kyle."
Cartman,"Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it!"
[OTH],"Um. How's he doing, nurse?"
[OTH],"He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now."
[OTH],Nno! No drugs.
[OTH],"Drugs are good, mkay?"
[OTH],Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium!
[OTH],"But why, van Gelder?"
[OTH],The machine. The machine is aaaah.
[OTH],The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
[OTH],"He's been talking about ""the machine"" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes."
[OTH],Wha- why in America's Funniest Home Videos? Why?
[OTH],"Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?"
[OTH],A what?
[OTH],"Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope."
[OTH],"Well, what will you need?"
[OTH],"Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time. Mkay?"
[OTH],"Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more."
[OTH],They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"This way, please."
[OTH],Enjoy your visit.
[OTH],"Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star."
[OTH],I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
[OTH],"Certainly, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-
[OTH],...and right over here we see the constellation Orion.
[OTH],"Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar..."
[OTH],"Dude, what just happened?"
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens."
[OTH],"Don't pick your nose, hon."
Cartman,"I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!"
[OTH],Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
Cartman,I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
[OTH],"Do you think I might win, Mommy?"
[OTH],"I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while."
Cartman,"Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!"
[OTH],"Did you hear that, Mommy?"
[OTH],Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs!
Cartman,Sike!
[OTH],What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-"
[OTH],Sshh!
[OTH],"Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming."
[OTH],I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
[OTH],"Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!"
[OTH],"Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here."
[OTH],"Yes. Yes, please!"
[OTH],Me too! And me!
[OTH],Me too! I wanna do it! I'd love to work here.
[OTH],I'd like to tape the show!
[OTH],"Yeah, me too! Me too!"
[OTH],"Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay!"
[OTH],Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],"Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it."
[OTH],Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer.
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Dude, this isn't right."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],"Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there."
[OTH],Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
[OTH],"Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see."
[OTH],(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.)
[OTH],He hits this switch-
[OTH],(I don't see anything.)
[OTH],"You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars."
[OTH],"Yeah, I guess so."
[OTH],"(Whoa, dude.)"
[OTH],What does that do?
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],Kenny! What's it doing?
[OTH],"This says ""maximum."""
[OTH],"Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],We're bastards!
[OTH],"Dude, I told you something was up with this place!"
[OTH],"We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!"
[OTH],"(clap clap clap)

[OTH],"Thank you... uh, Peter. We'll let you know very soon."
[OTH],"Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman."
[OTH],"Hello, everybody. Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon."
Cartman,"I know, I know!"
Cartman,"She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right."
Cartman,"She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right."
[OTH],"Well, Eric Cartman, that certainly was... insane."
Cartman,Thank you.
[OTH],We'll let you know.
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Don't pick your nose, hon."
Cartman,"I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!"
[OTH],"Jesus, where do we find these people?!"
[OTH],Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
[OTH],This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
[OTH],"Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded."
[OTH],Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
[OTH],Dr. Adams.
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],He owns the planetarium. What about him?
[OTH],He uses the machine. The star machine.
[OTH],Mkay?
[OTH],He uses it to erase minds.
[OTH],But why?
[OTH],"Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive."
[OTH],My God! This is amazing!
[OTH],"Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?"
[OTH],"Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman."
Cartman,Yes! I'm the best!
[OTH],You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium.
[OTH],That's odd.
Cartman,Sweeet!
[OTH],It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams."
[OTH],"Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium."
[OTH],"So, bring the whole family to the plane-*tarium* for a night of excitement and wonder."
[OTH],"...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis."
[OTH],"That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys."
[OTH],"But it's true, dude!"
[OTH],Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
[OTH],"Yeah, pretty sure."
[OTH],"Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong."
[OTH],What other crime in South Park?
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. Let's go."
[OTH],Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
Cartman,I'm over here.
[OTH],"Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy."
Cartman,Aay!
Cartman,Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
[OTH],"Okay, roll camera, aaand action."
Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you-"
[OTH],"Oh wait, wait."
[OTH],"You've got a little eye booger, hon."
Cartman,"Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!"
[OTH],Got it.
[OTH],Aaand action.
Cartman,I love Cheesy Poofs-
[OTH],Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?
[OTH],Sure thing.
Cartman,"Oh, man, c'mon!"
[OTH],Got it.
[OTH],"Okay. Here we go, aaand action."
Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-"
[OTH],Cut!
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
Cartman,"Oh, God damnit!"
[OTH],"Oh. Hello, officer of the law."
[OTH],"Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator."
[OTH],What brings you out here?
[OTH],"Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town."
[OTH],"Oh, really?"
[OTH],Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of.
[OTH],"Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time."
[OTH],"Okay, I'll be quick, then."
[OTH],"Of course, officer. Come on in."
[OTH],"Hello, children."
[OTH],"Oh, no! They got Chef, too!"
[OTH],Welcome to the planetarium.
[OTH],"Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef."
[OTH],I love my work.
[OTH],"Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too."
[OTH],"Would you like to see the stars, officer?"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],That would be super-duper!
[OTH],"Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!"
[OTH],Hello?
Cartman,"Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric."
[OTH],"Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you."
Cartman,"I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch."
[OTH],"Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for-"
Cartman,"Okay, bye."
[OTH],Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message.
Cartman,Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch.
[OTH],"Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message."
Cartman,Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
[OTH],And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.
[OTH],"Oh, neato!"
[OTH],"And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],To not be Elvis will cause you great pain.
[OTH],Pain.
[OTH],"You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me."
[OTH],He's not highly intelligent.
[OTH],"Why are you doing this, dude?"
[OTH],"Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you!"
[OTH],Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements.
Cartman,"Oh, dude, here it comes!"
[OTH],"Packed full of ingredients, Cheesy Poofs can really give you that quick pick-me-up. So remember, I love Cheesy Poofs,
you love Cheesy Poofs If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs,
we'd be-"
Cartman,Lame.
[OTH],And now back to Terrance and Phillip.
Cartman,"Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!"
[OTH],Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay!
[OTH],Mr. Mackey!
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control."
[OTH],Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?
[OTH],What's wrong with him?
[OTH],"Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babe
uhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah."
[OTH],"Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston."
[OTH],"No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis. Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium."
[OTH],Holdjit
[OTH],"If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?"
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],Odle-oh who whoo?
[OTH],"Well, let's begin, shall we?"
[OTH],"And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known!"
Cartman,"Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!"
Cartman,Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!
Cartman,You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!
Cartman,Planetariums suck ass!
[OTH],Aaah. Aaah. Aaah.
[OTH],Cartman! You saved us!
Cartman,What the hell are you talking about?
[OTH],Get over here and untie us!
[OTH],"Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay?"
[OTH],"Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business."
[OTH],"Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?"
[OTH],"Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor."
[OTH],Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
[OTH],He got a full dose of the stars.
[OTH],Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
[OTH],"Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing."
Cartman,"Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero."
[OTH],"Don't pick your nose, hon."
Cartman,"God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!"
[OTH],"Well, detective. It looks like ya fooled them again."
[OTH],"All in a day's work, I guess. I just hope that next time, I won't have to run so much."
[OTH],"Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, ""This is not a victimless crime""? Anybody? Children, were you paying attention?!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention."
[OTH],"Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?"
[OTH],Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
[OTH],"Oh, and what do you consider normal?!"
[OTH],"I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],To where?
[OTH],To the planetarium.
[OTH],AAWWWW!
Cartman,Planetariums suck!
[OTH],"Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium?"
[OTH],It's boring.
[OTH],"Yeah, all the constellations look alike."
[OTH],"Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege."
[OTH],Aawwww.
[OTH],"Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials."
[OTH],"Hey kids, do you love Cheesy Poofs?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Well, Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy Cheesy Poofs song. Watch for our talent van as it goes around the country."
Cartman,I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
[OTH],"If you win, you could be picked to be in our next Cheesy Poofs commercial. So remember,

I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame."
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road."
[OTH],THAT AIN'T HOW YOU DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!!
[OTH],"Ow! Jesus, lady!"
[OTH],"THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF!"
[OTH],Ow.
[OTH],"Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves."
[OTH],Does your child have what it takes to be the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer?
Cartman,"Hey, there it is!"
[OTH],We're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the Cheesy Poofs song better than anybody.
Cartman,I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back!
[OTH],"You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!"
[OTH],"Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium."
Cartman,But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
[OTH],"No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on!"
Cartman,But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
[OTH],"Wow, don't you...?"
[OTH],What is that?
[OTH],"Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium."
[OTH],I thought it was planetarium.
[OTH],"Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the ""t"" in ""plane'arium""."
[OTH],That's a pretty weird bone disease.
[OTH],Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.
[OTH],"Yes, little boy?"
Cartman,How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside?
[OTH],"Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works."
Cartman,As if we care.
[OTH],"Hey, who are you?"
[OTH],"Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us."
[OTH],I love my work.
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?"
[OTH],I love my work.
[OTH],"Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?"
[OTH],"Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable."
[OTH],This is stupid.
[OTH],And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... eh-come out.
[OTH],Whoopie.
[OTH],"Here we see the constellation called, ""The Big Dipper"". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it... a-hah ...we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull..."
[OTH],"...while these stars form the constellation, ""Roger Ebert""."
[OTH],And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades.
[OTH],"Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of..."
Cartman,"Aw man, screw this."
[OTH],And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.
[OTH],"I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that."
[OTH],"...you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame."
[OTH],"That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner."
Cartman,"Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!"
[OTH],"Oh, and what's your name, little boy?"
Cartman,Eric Cartman.
[OTH],"Alright, here's Eric Cartman giving it a shot."
[OTH],Aaah!
Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs
you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs
we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!"
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,"Thaat's right, suck on that."
[OTH],"Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?"
[OTH],"Oh, man, I don't feel so good."
[OTH],"Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium."
[OTH],Me too. It was sweet.
[OTH],Really? What did you like best about it?
[OTH],I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
[OTH],Wait a minute. Where is Eric?
Cartman,I did it! I did it!
[OTH],Did what?
Cartman,I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
[OTH],You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
Cartman,"Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!"
[OTH],"Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor."
[OTH],My head still feels funny.
[OTH],"Yeah, mine too."
Cartman,"Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want."
[OTH],"Like you really need it, hippo-ass!"
Cartman,"It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is."
[OTH],Waaaah!
[OTH],AAAAAH!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!"
[OTH],My... name... is... vvan... G-gelder.
[OTH],"Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!"
[OTH],"Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!"
[OTH],Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno!
Cartman,"Hey, be careful, asshole!"
[OTH],Eegh! Don't take me back there!
[OTH],I can't... can't...
[OTH],"Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!"
[OTH],Aaaagghh.
[OTH],"We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!"
[OTH],Aagh! The planetarium! Haah!
[OTH],I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.
[OTH],Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay!
[OTH],Okay uh van Gelder-
[OTH],Nnnaaaah!
[OTH],"-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?"
[OTH],Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh-
[OTH],"Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?"
[OTH],"Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium."
[OTH],Haah! Planetarium!
[OTH],I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
[OTH],Nnaaah!
[OTH],"Oh, man, this is boring!"
[OTH],"Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting?"
[OTH],"Dude, this is totally killer."
[OTH],"I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man."
[OTH],You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.
[OTH],Incredible pain!
[OTH],Incredible icky paaiin!
[OTH],"Dude, I'm totally tripping."
[OTH],This is totally killer.
[OTH],"Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?"
[OTH],That's a haiku?
[OTH],"No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Was he on the school bus this morning?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd."
[OTH],"Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?"
[OTH],"(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)"
[OTH],Yeah. What's a discharge?
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?"
[OTH],"Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too."
[OTH],But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
[OTH],"Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?"
[OTH],I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
[OTH],"Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street."
Cartman,"Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams."
[OTH],"Eric, where have you been?"
Cartman,"Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?"
[OTH],"Where have you been, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship!"
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,"This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it? Hey, where is your regional championship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?"
Cartman,"Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?"
Cartman,"Apparently, only I do."
[OTH],"Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too."
Cartman,"Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion."
[OTH],Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
Cartman,It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
[OTH],"I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV."
[OTH],"Very good, Kyle."
Cartman,"Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it!"
[OTH],"Um. How's he doing, nurse?"
[OTH],"He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now."
[OTH],Nno! No drugs.
[OTH],"Drugs are good, mkay?"
[OTH],Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium!
[OTH],"But why, van Gelder?"
[OTH],The machine. The machine is aaaah.
[OTH],The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
[OTH],"He's been talking about ""the machine"" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes."
[OTH],Wha- why in America's Funniest Home Videos? Why?
[OTH],"Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?"
[OTH],A what?
[OTH],"Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope."
[OTH],"Well, what will you need?"
[OTH],"Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time. Mkay?"
[OTH],"Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more."
[OTH],They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"This way, please."
[OTH],Enjoy your visit.
[OTH],"Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star."
[OTH],I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
[OTH],"Certainly, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-
[OTH],...and right over here we see the constellation Orion.
[OTH],"Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar..."
[OTH],"Dude, what just happened?"
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens."
[OTH],"Don't pick your nose, hon."
Cartman,"I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!"
[OTH],Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
Cartman,I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
[OTH],"Do you think I might win, Mommy?"
[OTH],"I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while."
Cartman,"Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!"
[OTH],"Did you hear that, Mommy?"
[OTH],Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs!
Cartman,Sike!
[OTH],What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-"
[OTH],Sshh!
[OTH],"Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming."
[OTH],I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
[OTH],"Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!"
[OTH],"Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here."
[OTH],"Yes. Yes, please!"
[OTH],Me too! And me!
[OTH],Me too! I wanna do it! I'd love to work here.
[OTH],I'd like to tape the show!
[OTH],"Yeah, me too! Me too!"
[OTH],"Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay!"
[OTH],Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],"Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it."
[OTH],Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer.
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Dude, this isn't right."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],"Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there."
[OTH],Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
[OTH],"Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see."
[OTH],(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.)
[OTH],He hits this switch-
[OTH],(I don't see anything.)
[OTH],"You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars."
[OTH],"Yeah, I guess so."
[OTH],"(Whoa, dude.)"
[OTH],What does that do?
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],Kenny! What's it doing?
[OTH],"This says ""maximum."""
[OTH],"Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],We're bastards!
[OTH],"Dude, I told you something was up with this place!"
[OTH],"We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!"
[OTH],"(clap clap clap)

[OTH],"Thank you... uh, Peter. We'll let you know very soon."
[OTH],"Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman."
[OTH],"Hello, everybody. Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon."
Cartman,"I know, I know!"
Cartman,"She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right."
Cartman,"She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right."
[OTH],"Well, Eric Cartman, that certainly was... insane."
Cartman,Thank you.
[OTH],We'll let you know.
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Don't pick your nose, hon."
Cartman,"I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!"
[OTH],"Jesus, where do we find these people?!"
[OTH],Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
[OTH],This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
[OTH],"Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded."
[OTH],Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
[OTH],Dr. Adams.
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],He owns the planetarium. What about him?
[OTH],He uses the machine. The star machine.
[OTH],Mkay?
[OTH],He uses it to erase minds.
[OTH],But why?
[OTH],"Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive."
[OTH],My God! This is amazing!
[OTH],"Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?"
[OTH],"Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman."
Cartman,Yes! I'm the best!
[OTH],You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium.
[OTH],That's odd.
Cartman,Sweeet!
[OTH],It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams."
[OTH],"Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium."
[OTH],"So, bring the whole family to the plane-*tarium* for a night of excitement and wonder."
[OTH],"...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis."
[OTH],"That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys."
[OTH],"But it's true, dude!"
[OTH],Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
[OTH],"Yeah, pretty sure."
[OTH],"Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong."
[OTH],What other crime in South Park?
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. Let's go."
[OTH],Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
Cartman,I'm over here.
[OTH],"Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy."
Cartman,Aay!
Cartman,Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
[OTH],"Okay, roll camera, aaand action."
Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you-"
[OTH],"Oh wait, wait."
[OTH],"You've got a little eye booger, hon."
Cartman,"Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!"
[OTH],Got it.
[OTH],Aaand action.
Cartman,I love Cheesy Poofs-
[OTH],Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?
[OTH],Sure thing.
Cartman,"Oh, man, c'mon!"
[OTH],Got it.
[OTH],"Okay. Here we go, aaand action."
Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-"
[OTH],Cut!
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
Cartman,"Oh, God damnit!"
[OTH],"Oh. Hello, officer of the law."
[OTH],"Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator."
[OTH],What brings you out here?
[OTH],"Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town."
[OTH],"Oh, really?"
[OTH],Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of.
[OTH],"Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time."
[OTH],"Okay, I'll be quick, then."
[OTH],"Of course, officer. Come on in."
[OTH],"Hello, children."
[OTH],"Oh, no! They got Chef, too!"
[OTH],Welcome to the planetarium.
[OTH],"Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef."
[OTH],I love my work.
[OTH],"Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too."
[OTH],"Would you like to see the stars, officer?"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],That would be super-duper!
[OTH],"Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!"
[OTH],Hello?
Cartman,"Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric."
[OTH],"Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you."
Cartman,"I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch."
[OTH],"Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for-"
Cartman,"Okay, bye."
[OTH],Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message.
Cartman,Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch.
[OTH],"Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message."
Cartman,Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
[OTH],And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.
[OTH],"Oh, neato!"
[OTH],"And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],To not be Elvis will cause you great pain.
[OTH],Pain.
[OTH],"You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me."
[OTH],He's not highly intelligent.
[OTH],"Why are you doing this, dude?"
[OTH],"Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you!"
[OTH],Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements.
Cartman,"Oh, dude, here it comes!"
[OTH],"Packed full of ingredients, Cheesy Poofs can really give you that quick pick-me-up. So remember, I love Cheesy Poofs,
you love Cheesy Poofs If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs,
we'd be-"
Cartman,Lame.
[OTH],And now back to Terrance and Phillip.
Cartman,"Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!"
[OTH],Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay!
[OTH],Mr. Mackey!
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control."
[OTH],Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?
[OTH],What's wrong with him?
[OTH],"Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babe
uhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah."
[OTH],"Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston."
[OTH],"No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis. Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium."
[OTH],Holdjit
[OTH],"If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?"
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],Odle-oh who whoo?
[OTH],"Well, let's begin, shall we?"
[OTH],"And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known!"
Cartman,"Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!"
Cartman,Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!
Cartman,You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!
Cartman,Planetariums suck ass!
[OTH],Aaah. Aaah. Aaah.
[OTH],Cartman! You saved us!
Cartman,What the hell are you talking about?
[OTH],Get over here and untie us!
[OTH],"Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay?"
[OTH],"Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business."
[OTH],"Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?"
[OTH],"Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor."
[OTH],Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
[OTH],He got a full dose of the stars.
[OTH],Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
[OTH],"Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing."
Cartman,"Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero."
[OTH],"Don't pick your nose, hon."
Cartman,"God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!"
[OTH],Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.
[OTH],Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.
[OTH],American base is only a few feet away.
Cartman,What is this? Halt!
Cartman,It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
[OTH],"Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!"
[OTH],Yeah! You're dead!
Cartman,"I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--"
[OTH],"No, you don't!"
Cartman,"--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets."
[OTH],"Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!"
[OTH],"Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!"
Cartman,That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Well? Now what are we going to do?
[OTH],Huh-I dunno.
[OTH],"Hi, Stan."
[OTH],"Hi, Wendy."
[OTH],"Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today?"
[OTH],I dunno.
[OTH],She does. She looks very pretty.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Stan, can I talk to you for a second?"
[OTH],"Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace."
[OTH],We could?
[OTH],"Yeah, Stan."
[OTH],"But dude, I don't have a clubhouse."
[OTH],You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
[OTH],Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
Cartman,Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk!
[OTH],(Heellp!!)
[OTH],"Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!"
[OTH],Truth or Dare? Wow.
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do."
[OTH],We do?
[OTH],We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.
[OTH],Did it work?
[OTH],"I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend."
[OTH],I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
[OTH],"Hey, Phillip, pull my finger."
[OTH],"All right, Terrance."
[OTH],"Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder."
[OTH],"Well, all right."
[OTH],"Hurgh, urgh."
[OTH],"Damnit! Pull really hard, Phillip!"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!"
[OTH],Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-
[OTH],Caught you there!
[OTH],Uh oh!
[OTH],"God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!"
[OTH],"Yes, I sure did!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip."
[OTH],"No, I was just uh flipping through the channels."
[OTH],"Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],How do we do it?
[OTH],"Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude! How'd you know?"
[OTH],How do you think I met your mother?
[OTH],"Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!"
[OTH],"Oh, brother."
[OTH],"Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!"
[OTH],"Yeah, Stanley, you should know better."
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot."
[OTH],"Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?"
[OTH],"Okay, okay."
[OTH],"Hey hey hey. What's goin' on, Rudy?"
[OTH],"Man, Fat Abbot, you need to lose weight."
[OTH],"I'll lose weight when I feel like it, bitch! Shut yo bitchass mouth, ho!"
[OTH],"Bitch, I'll kick yo ass!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Sweet!
[OTH],"You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo n***a ass, shithead!"
[OTH],"Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!"
[OTH],Did you find it?
[OTH],"Give me a second, would you?"
[OTH],Don't snap at me!
[OTH],I didn't snap at you.
[OTH],You snapped at me!
[OTH],Whatever.
[OTH],"What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, ""whatever,"" to me!"
[OTH],"I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, too."
[OTH],Uh I think I found it.
[OTH],"That's not it, you idiot!"
[OTH],"Hey, back off, bitch!"
[OTH],You just said the C-word!
[OTH],Did I?
[OTH],This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],"Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play."
[OTH],"Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass."
[OTH],"Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?"
[OTH],What? Why?
[OTH],"Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs."
[OTH],Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!
Cartman,What are you guys doing?
[OTH],We're building a clubhouse.
Cartman,"A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!"
[OTH],"It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!"
Cartman,Wwwhy??
[OTH],"Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?"
[OTH],"Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!"
Cartman,That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,"Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!"
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,Fine!
[OTH],Fine!
[OTH],(Fine!)
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,Fine! That's fine.
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,Fine!
Cartman,"No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!"
[OTH],"(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--)"
Cartman,"Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker."
[OTH],(Uh--)
Cartman,"No, Kenny."
[OTH],"How's the treehouse coming along, hon?"
Cartman,"Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!"
[OTH],"Sorry, hon."
Cartman,Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
[OTH],"Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare."
Cartman,"But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!"
[OTH],"Well, all right."
Cartman,"Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now."
[OTH],(You suck ass and you suck dick!)
Cartman,And stop your bitchin'!
[OTH],"What are you doing, sweetheart?"
[OTH],Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
[OTH],"You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie!"
[OTH],'Kay.
[OTH],"And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?"
[OTH],"Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--"
[OTH],When is Mr. Hat coming back?
[OTH],What did you say?!
[OTH],When is Mr. Hat coming back?
[OTH],"I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!"
[OTH],But Mr. Twig sucks.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104..."
Cartman,"So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?"
[OTH],"Better than yours, fat boy."
Cartman,"We'll see about that. Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Yes, sir..!)"
[OTH],Is the clubhouse ready?
[OTH],Almost.
[OTH],Stan? Are you paying attention?
[OTH],"Yes, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?"
[OTH],"Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings."
[OTH],"...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention."
[OTH],"Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh..."
[OTH],"Good guess, dude!"
[OTH],Phew.
[OTH],Pssst! Pass this up.
[OTH],Pass this up.
[OTH],Pass this up.
[OTH],P-huh pass this h-up.
[OTH],"Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!"
[OTH],"No, I just--"
[OTH],"Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile."
[OTH],I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
[OTH],"Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!"
[OTH],But I didn't write the note!
Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!"
[OTH],"Oh, man."
[OTH],"Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass.
I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you.
 I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, m'kay? Not for immature skylarkings."
[OTH],What's 'skylarkings'?
[OTH],"You know, like tomfooleries."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],"Oh, your parents are here."
[OTH],"Oh, no."
[OTH],Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
[OTH],"Stanley, I... Skylarkings?"
[OTH],Yeahm'kay?
[OTH],"Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school."
[OTH],"Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school."
[OTH],"It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's."
[OTH],"Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder."
[OTH],"You really should know better, Stanley."
[OTH],"You need to shape up, mister."
[OTH],Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
[OTH],I don't interrupt you.
[OTH],"There, you did it again! He interrupted me again."
[OTH],"Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--"
[OTH],"Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!"
[OTH],"Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad."
[OTH],Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
[OTH],Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.
[OTH],When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
[OTH],"Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling."
[OTH],"Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say."
[OTH],"Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--"
[OTH],Excuse me.
[OTH],-how do you feel?
[OTH],Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
[OTH],"Oh, please!"
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Oh, please yourself!"
[OTH],"Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?"
[OTH],He is.
[OTH],"No, she is."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again!"
[OTH],Mmkay.
Cartman,"Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built."
Cartman,"Oh, man!"
[OTH],(Uh huh)
Cartman,"And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny."
[OTH],(Yeah!)
Cartman,"All right. You go find chicks, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)"
Cartman,"Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!"
Cartman,"Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?"
[OTH],Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
[OTH],I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
[OTH],To me??
[OTH],"I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!"
[OTH],"We should use nails, dude."
[OTH],My mom won't let us.
[OTH],"Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?"
[OTH],Pretty good. We're almost done.
[OTH],"Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!"
[OTH],We're going as fast as we can!
[OTH],"Kyle, could you turn around for a second?"
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster."
[OTH],"Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?"
[OTH],I didn't even think about that.
[OTH],"And then, they'll ask, ""Truth or Dare?'"
[OTH],"And I say, ""Dare!"""
[OTH],"No no! You say, ""Truth."""
[OTH],"""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her."
[OTH],"You have to say ""Truth"" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager."
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Then, after a few ""Truth""s, you finally answer, ""Dare."""
[OTH],"""Dare!"""
[OTH],"But not like that, son. Like this: ""Daaare""."
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
[OTH],You really think so?
[OTH],Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?"
[OTH],"Man, Fat Abbot. What are you doin' on this side of the 'hood?"
[OTH],"You know somethin', Rudy? You're like school in summertime."
[OTH],School in summertime?
[OTH],"Yeah, bitch, school in summertime!"
[OTH],"Open yo' fuckin' ears and shit, ho, or I'll pop your bitch ass."
[OTH],"I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha."
Cartman,What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?
Cartman,"Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?"
[OTH],(Uh-huh)
[OTH],Hi. We ran away from home.
[OTH],"Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days."
Cartman,Holy crap!
Cartman,Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
[OTH],"Oh well, I guess it beats living at home."
Cartman,Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
[OTH],Hello?
Cartman,"How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?"
[OTH],We're working on it.
Cartman,"Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over."
[OTH],"No, you don't!"
[OTH],Dude!
Cartman,"It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole."
[OTH],"Aw, that hunk of fat-- Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?"
[OTH],"Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out."
[OTH],What?! Why?
[OTH],"Because, we're divorced, Stanley."
[OTH],"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?"
[OTH],"Yeah, kind of."
[OTH],"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!"
[OTH],"But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy."
[OTH],"Hello, son."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted.
[OTH],"Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me."
[OTH],This is happening way too fast.
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!"
[OTH],"So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, ""Make sure you're home before midnight!"""
Cartman,"Ahaw, that's weak."
[OTH],"And I go, ""Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"""
Cartman,That's killer.
[OTH],"And she goes, ""Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"""
Cartman,That's totally weak!
[OTH],"So I go, ""Fine! I won't come home!"""
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"And then she goes, ""Fine! Don't come home!"", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap."
Cartman,"Killer weak, sweet!"
[OTH],I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.
[OTH],I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
Cartman,"I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"""
[OTH],Okay. We're done.
[OTH],"Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy."
[OTH],"It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],G'oh?
[OTH],"Stanley, it's time to go!"
[OTH],Go where?
[OTH],"Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you."
[OTH],But no! I have to get the girls to come-
[OTH],"Come on, Stanley!"
[OTH],Weak!
[OTH],Dad?
[OTH],"Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in."
[OTH],"Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up."
[OTH],But I don't understand why we have to--
[OTH],"Well, hello, ladies."
[OTH],"Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight."
[OTH],I'm already there.
[OTH],"What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more."
[OTH],"Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?"
[OTH],"Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what."
[OTH],But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?
[OTH],"You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister."
[OTH],"Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it."
[OTH],"Well, anyway, have a nice day."
[OTH],What? That's it?
[OTH],"Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out."
[OTH],"You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?"
[OTH],"I guess, but--"
[OTH],"Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute."
[OTH],"Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls."
[OTH],"No way, dude! Don't be silly."
[OTH],"Come on, Wendy."
[OTH],"We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?"
[OTH],Right. Why?
[OTH],"Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager."
[OTH],Too eager to what?
[OTH],"To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez."
[OTH],"Hi, guys."
[OTH],"Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?"
[OTH],"Don't you guys still wanna play ""Truth or Dare""?"
[OTH],"Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever."
[OTH],Then come on!
[OTH],"Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Who wants to go first?
[OTH],I will. Kyle?
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],Truth or Dare?
[OTH],Umm. Dare?
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],How about we give him Bebe?
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Kiss Bebe on the lips!
[OTH],"What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!"
[OTH],"What's the matter, Kyle?"
[OTH],"It's just wrong, that's all."
[OTH],"Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes."
[OTH],What the hell have you gotten me into?!
[OTH],"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?"
[OTH],Hoh boy.
[OTH],Sick!
[OTH],Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!
[OTH],"Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!"
[OTH],"Your turn, Bebe."
[OTH],"Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],"Stan, Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],Dare.
[OTH],"Son, could you please help me with the firewood?"
[OTH],"...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!"
[OTH],"When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me."
[OTH],"Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow."
[OTH],Crap!
[OTH],I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen.
[OTH],Our moms won't even let us smoke.
[OTH],"Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it."
Cartman,"Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!"
[OTH],"Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night."
[OTH],"Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?"
Cartman,"Coming, Mom. Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!"
[OTH],"Hey, girls."
[OTH],What's up.
[OTH],"Oh hey, Scott."
Cartman,Who the hell are you?!
[OTH],Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind.
Cartman,How many people?
[OTH],"Kyle, can I talk to you?"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
[OTH],"Okay, that's fine."
[OTH],"No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way."
[OTH],But I don't care.
[OTH],Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.
[OTH],"Okay, Clyde, we can go now."
[OTH],Bitchin'.
[OTH],"These are café curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that!"
[OTH],Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
[OTH],Nnuuhunuuhh.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Chores. Do chores.
[OTH],My dad lets me watch cartoons.
[OTH],Well I'm not your dad. Okay? I'm not your dad! You- you can't just go around playing games with my emotions.
[OTH],"Stanley, what did you do to Roy?"
[OTH],Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
[OTH],"Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?"
[OTH],"If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!"
[OTH],"Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, ""you're the most important thing to me,"" what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Bye now. Roy!
[OTH],Divorce is stupid.
[OTH],Heeyy heeyy heeyy! Hey Yolanda. Why is your eye all black and blue and shit?
[OTH],"Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye."
[OTH],Stepdad? You gotta off his ass!
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yeah, bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap! Leave that motherfucker swingin' from a tree so high nobody finds him for days! Glock-glock, you know what I'm sayin'? Dumbassed motherfucker pullin' shit! Damn!"
[OTH],"You're right, Fat Abbot. Thanks!"
[OTH],"No problem, ho. Maybe later you can suck my dick, bitch-ho! Shit!"
[OTH],"Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding."
[OTH],"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy."
[OTH],"Hey, kid, give me some of those!"
Cartman,Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
[OTH],What? That game's for kids.
Cartman,This is bullcrap!
[OTH],"Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party."
Cartman,"This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!"
[OTH],Mosh pit!
[OTH],(Huh?)
Cartman,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?
[OTH],"Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of Harper's?"
[OTH],Meet me at the clubhouse.
[OTH],"Oh, Randy. What are you doing here?"
[OTH],"I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse."
[OTH],Oh I thought that note was for me.
[OTH],"Oh, maybe it was."
[OTH],"Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here."
[OTH],I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
[OTH],Goodnight.
[OTH],Sharon?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Truth or Dare?
[OTH],It's too late for games.
[OTH],"No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],Truth.
[OTH],Do you still love me?
[OTH],"Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him."
[OTH],Sharon--
[OTH],Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
[OTH],"Well, you never know. Maybe--"
[OTH],He-
[OTH],--thing will work out.
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
[OTH],Sharon?
[OTH],Dare.
[OTH],Do me. Right here in the clubhouse.
[OTH],Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?
[OTH],Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
[OTH],Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
[OTH],Dare.
[OTH],Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
[OTH],...What?!
[OTH],"Wow, that sucks! Do you think it'll hurt?"
[OTH],"Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?"
[OTH],Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.
[OTH],Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.
[OTH],American base is only a few feet away.
Cartman,What is this? Halt!
Cartman,It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
[OTH],"Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!"
[OTH],Yeah! You're dead!
Cartman,"I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--"
[OTH],"No, you don't!"
Cartman,"--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets."
[OTH],"Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!"
[OTH],"Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!"
Cartman,That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Well? Now what are we going to do?
[OTH],Huh-I dunno.
[OTH],"Hi, Stan."
[OTH],"Hi, Wendy."
[OTH],"Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today?"
[OTH],I dunno.
[OTH],She does. She looks very pretty.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Stan, can I talk to you for a second?"
[OTH],"Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace."
[OTH],We could?
[OTH],"Yeah, Stan."
[OTH],"But dude, I don't have a clubhouse."
[OTH],You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
[OTH],Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
Cartman,Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk!
[OTH],(Heellp!!)
[OTH],"Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!"
[OTH],Truth or Dare? Wow.
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do."
[OTH],We do?
[OTH],We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.
[OTH],Did it work?
[OTH],"I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend."
[OTH],I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
[OTH],"Hey, Phillip, pull my finger."
[OTH],"All right, Terrance."
[OTH],"Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder."
[OTH],"Well, all right."
[OTH],"Hurgh, urgh."
[OTH],"Damnit! Pull really hard, Phillip!"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!"
[OTH],Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-
[OTH],Caught you there!
[OTH],Uh oh!
[OTH],"God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!"
[OTH],"Yes, I sure did!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip."
[OTH],"No, I was just uh flipping through the channels."
[OTH],"Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],How do we do it?
[OTH],"Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude! How'd you know?"
[OTH],How do you think I met your mother?
[OTH],"Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!"
[OTH],"Oh, brother."
[OTH],"Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!"
[OTH],"Yeah, Stanley, you should know better."
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot."
[OTH],"Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?"
[OTH],"Okay, okay."
[OTH],"Hey hey hey. What's goin' on, Rudy?"
[OTH],"Man, Fat Abbot, you need to lose weight."
[OTH],"I'll lose weight when I feel like it, bitch! Shut yo bitchass mouth, ho!"
[OTH],"Bitch, I'll kick yo ass!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Sweet!
[OTH],"You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo n***a ass, shithead!"
[OTH],"Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!"
[OTH],Did you find it?
[OTH],"Give me a second, would you?"
[OTH],Don't snap at me!
[OTH],I didn't snap at you.
[OTH],You snapped at me!
[OTH],Whatever.
[OTH],"What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, ""whatever,"" to me!"
[OTH],"I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, too."
[OTH],Uh I think I found it.
[OTH],"That's not it, you idiot!"
[OTH],"Hey, back off, bitch!"
[OTH],You just said the C-word!
[OTH],Did I?
[OTH],This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],"Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play."
[OTH],"Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass."
[OTH],"Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?"
[OTH],What? Why?
[OTH],"Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs."
[OTH],Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!
Cartman,What are you guys doing?
[OTH],We're building a clubhouse.
Cartman,"A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!"
[OTH],"It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!"
Cartman,Wwwhy??
[OTH],"Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?"
[OTH],"Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!"
Cartman,That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,"Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!"
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,Fine!
[OTH],Fine!
[OTH],(Fine!)
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,Fine! That's fine.
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,Fine!
Cartman,"No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!"
[OTH],"(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--)"
Cartman,"Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker."
[OTH],(Uh--)
Cartman,"No, Kenny."
[OTH],"How's the treehouse coming along, hon?"
Cartman,"Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!"
[OTH],"Sorry, hon."
Cartman,Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
[OTH],"Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare."
Cartman,"But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!"
[OTH],"Well, all right."
Cartman,"Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now."
[OTH],(You suck ass and you suck dick!)
Cartman,And stop your bitchin'!
[OTH],"What are you doing, sweetheart?"
[OTH],Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
[OTH],"You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie!"
[OTH],'Kay.
[OTH],"And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?"
[OTH],"Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--"
[OTH],When is Mr. Hat coming back?
[OTH],What did you say?!
[OTH],When is Mr. Hat coming back?
[OTH],"I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!"
[OTH],But Mr. Twig sucks.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104..."
Cartman,"So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?"
[OTH],"Better than yours, fat boy."
Cartman,"We'll see about that. Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Yes, sir..!)"
[OTH],Is the clubhouse ready?
[OTH],Almost.
[OTH],Stan? Are you paying attention?
[OTH],"Yes, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?"
[OTH],"Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings."
[OTH],"...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention."
[OTH],"Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh..."
[OTH],"Good guess, dude!"
[OTH],Phew.
[OTH],Pssst! Pass this up.
[OTH],Pass this up.
[OTH],Pass this up.
[OTH],P-huh pass this h-up.
[OTH],"Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!"
[OTH],"No, I just--"
[OTH],"Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile."
[OTH],I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
[OTH],"Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!"
[OTH],But I didn't write the note!
Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!"
[OTH],"Oh, man."
[OTH],"Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass.
I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you.
 I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, m'kay? Not for immature skylarkings."
[OTH],What's 'skylarkings'?
[OTH],"You know, like tomfooleries."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],"Oh, your parents are here."
[OTH],"Oh, no."
[OTH],Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
[OTH],"Stanley, I... Skylarkings?"
[OTH],Yeahm'kay?
[OTH],"Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school."
[OTH],"Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school."
[OTH],"It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's."
[OTH],"Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder."
[OTH],"You really should know better, Stanley."
[OTH],"You need to shape up, mister."
[OTH],Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
[OTH],I don't interrupt you.
[OTH],"There, you did it again! He interrupted me again."
[OTH],"Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--"
[OTH],"Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!"
[OTH],"Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad."
[OTH],Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
[OTH],Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.
[OTH],When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
[OTH],"Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling."
[OTH],"Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say."
[OTH],"Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--"
[OTH],Excuse me.
[OTH],-how do you feel?
[OTH],Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
[OTH],"Oh, please!"
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Oh, please yourself!"
[OTH],"Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?"
[OTH],He is.
[OTH],"No, she is."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again!"
[OTH],Mmkay.
Cartman,"Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built."
Cartman,"Oh, man!"
[OTH],(Uh huh)
Cartman,"And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny."
[OTH],(Yeah!)
Cartman,"All right. You go find chicks, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)"
Cartman,"Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!"
Cartman,"Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?"
[OTH],Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
[OTH],I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
[OTH],To me??
[OTH],"I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!"
[OTH],"We should use nails, dude."
[OTH],My mom won't let us.
[OTH],"Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?"
[OTH],Pretty good. We're almost done.
[OTH],"Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!"
[OTH],We're going as fast as we can!
[OTH],"Kyle, could you turn around for a second?"
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster."
[OTH],"Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?"
[OTH],I didn't even think about that.
[OTH],"And then, they'll ask, ""Truth or Dare?'"
[OTH],"And I say, ""Dare!"""
[OTH],"No no! You say, ""Truth."""
[OTH],"""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her."
[OTH],"You have to say ""Truth"" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager."
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Then, after a few ""Truth""s, you finally answer, ""Dare."""
[OTH],"""Dare!"""
[OTH],"But not like that, son. Like this: ""Daaare""."
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
[OTH],You really think so?
[OTH],Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?"
[OTH],"Man, Fat Abbot. What are you doin' on this side of the 'hood?"
[OTH],"You know somethin', Rudy? You're like school in summertime."
[OTH],School in summertime?
[OTH],"Yeah, bitch, school in summertime!"
[OTH],"Open yo' fuckin' ears and shit, ho, or I'll pop your bitch ass."
[OTH],"I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha."
Cartman,What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?
Cartman,"Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?"
[OTH],(Uh-huh)
[OTH],Hi. We ran away from home.
[OTH],"Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days."
Cartman,Holy crap!
Cartman,Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
[OTH],"Oh well, I guess it beats living at home."
Cartman,Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
[OTH],Hello?
Cartman,"How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?"
[OTH],We're working on it.
Cartman,"Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over."
[OTH],"No, you don't!"
[OTH],Dude!
Cartman,"It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole."
[OTH],"Aw, that hunk of fat-- Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?"
[OTH],"Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out."
[OTH],What?! Why?
[OTH],"Because, we're divorced, Stanley."
[OTH],"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?"
[OTH],"Yeah, kind of."
[OTH],"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!"
[OTH],"But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy."
[OTH],"Hello, son."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted.
[OTH],"Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me."
[OTH],This is happening way too fast.
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!"
[OTH],"So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, ""Make sure you're home before midnight!"""
Cartman,"Ahaw, that's weak."
[OTH],"And I go, ""Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"""
Cartman,That's killer.
[OTH],"And she goes, ""Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"""
Cartman,That's totally weak!
[OTH],"So I go, ""Fine! I won't come home!"""
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"And then she goes, ""Fine! Don't come home!"", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap."
Cartman,"Killer weak, sweet!"
[OTH],I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.
[OTH],I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
Cartman,"I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"""
[OTH],Okay. We're done.
[OTH],"Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy."
[OTH],"It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],G'oh?
[OTH],"Stanley, it's time to go!"
[OTH],Go where?
[OTH],"Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you."
[OTH],But no! I have to get the girls to come-
[OTH],"Come on, Stanley!"
[OTH],Weak!
[OTH],Dad?
[OTH],"Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in."
[OTH],"Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up."
[OTH],But I don't understand why we have to--
[OTH],"Well, hello, ladies."
[OTH],"Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight."
[OTH],I'm already there.
[OTH],"What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more."
[OTH],"Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?"
[OTH],"Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what."
[OTH],But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?
[OTH],"You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister."
[OTH],"Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it."
[OTH],"Well, anyway, have a nice day."
[OTH],What? That's it?
[OTH],"Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out."
[OTH],"You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?"
[OTH],"I guess, but--"
[OTH],"Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute."
[OTH],"Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls."
[OTH],"No way, dude! Don't be silly."
[OTH],"Come on, Wendy."
[OTH],"We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?"
[OTH],Right. Why?
[OTH],"Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager."
[OTH],Too eager to what?
[OTH],"To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez."
[OTH],"Hi, guys."
[OTH],"Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?"
[OTH],"Don't you guys still wanna play ""Truth or Dare""?"
[OTH],"Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever."
[OTH],Then come on!
[OTH],"Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Who wants to go first?
[OTH],I will. Kyle?
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],Truth or Dare?
[OTH],Umm. Dare?
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],How about we give him Bebe?
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Kiss Bebe on the lips!
[OTH],"What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!"
[OTH],"What's the matter, Kyle?"
[OTH],"It's just wrong, that's all."
[OTH],"Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes."
[OTH],What the hell have you gotten me into?!
[OTH],"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?"
[OTH],Hoh boy.
[OTH],Sick!
[OTH],Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!
[OTH],"Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!"
[OTH],"Your turn, Bebe."
[OTH],"Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],"Stan, Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],Dare.
[OTH],"Son, could you please help me with the firewood?"
[OTH],"...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!"
[OTH],"When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me."
[OTH],"Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow."
[OTH],Crap!
[OTH],I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen.
[OTH],Our moms won't even let us smoke.
[OTH],"Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it."
Cartman,"Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!"
[OTH],"Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night."
[OTH],"Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?"
Cartman,"Coming, Mom. Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!"
[OTH],"Hey, girls."
[OTH],What's up.
[OTH],"Oh hey, Scott."
Cartman,Who the hell are you?!
[OTH],Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind.
Cartman,How many people?
[OTH],"Kyle, can I talk to you?"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
[OTH],"Okay, that's fine."
[OTH],"No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way."
[OTH],But I don't care.
[OTH],Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.
[OTH],"Okay, Clyde, we can go now."
[OTH],Bitchin'.
[OTH],"These are café curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that!"
[OTH],Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
[OTH],Nnuuhunuuhh.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Chores. Do chores.
[OTH],My dad lets me watch cartoons.
[OTH],Well I'm not your dad. Okay? I'm not your dad! You- you can't just go around playing games with my emotions.
[OTH],"Stanley, what did you do to Roy?"
[OTH],Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
[OTH],"Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?"
[OTH],"If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!"
[OTH],"Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, ""you're the most important thing to me,"" what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Bye now. Roy!
[OTH],Divorce is stupid.
[OTH],Heeyy heeyy heeyy! Hey Yolanda. Why is your eye all black and blue and shit?
[OTH],"Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye."
[OTH],Stepdad? You gotta off his ass!
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yeah, bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap! Leave that motherfucker swingin' from a tree so high nobody finds him for days! Glock-glock, you know what I'm sayin'? Dumbassed motherfucker pullin' shit! Damn!"
[OTH],"You're right, Fat Abbot. Thanks!"
[OTH],"No problem, ho. Maybe later you can suck my dick, bitch-ho! Shit!"
[OTH],"Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding."
[OTH],"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy."
[OTH],"Hey, kid, give me some of those!"
Cartman,Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
[OTH],What? That game's for kids.
Cartman,This is bullcrap!
[OTH],"Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party."
Cartman,"This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!"
[OTH],Mosh pit!
[OTH],(Huh?)
Cartman,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?
[OTH],"Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of Harper's?"
[OTH],Meet me at the clubhouse.
[OTH],"Oh, Randy. What are you doing here?"
[OTH],"I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse."
[OTH],Oh I thought that note was for me.
[OTH],"Oh, maybe it was."
[OTH],"Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here."
[OTH],I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
[OTH],Goodnight.
[OTH],Sharon?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Truth or Dare?
[OTH],It's too late for games.
[OTH],"No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?"
[OTH],Truth.
[OTH],Do you still love me?
[OTH],"Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him."
[OTH],Sharon--
[OTH],Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
[OTH],"Well, you never know. Maybe--"
[OTH],He-
[OTH],--thing will work out.
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
[OTH],Sharon?
[OTH],Dare.
[OTH],Do me. Right here in the clubhouse.
[OTH],Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?
[OTH],Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
[OTH],Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
[OTH],Dare.
[OTH],Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
[OTH],...What?!
[OTH],"Wow, that sucks! Do you think it'll hurt?"
[OTH],"Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?"
[OTH],"Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?"
[OTH],"We're ready, Bob!"
[OTH],Any particular prize you're hoping for?
[OTH],"Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too!"
[OTH],"Oh, anywhere'd be great!"
[OTH],Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum?
[OTH],"Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this."
[OTH],The upper vascular hood.
[OTH],"I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!"
[OTH],Fred tell 'em what they've won.
[OTH],"Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado!"
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],"That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival."
[OTH],"Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!"
[OTH],"Congratulations, Tom and Mary."
[OTH],"Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited."
[OTH],What was second prize again?
[OTH],That's all for now. See you tomorrow on...
[OTH],"Ooo, What The Hell Is That!"
[OTH],Ah shit!
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!"
[OTH],"As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow."
[OTH],"And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!"
[OTH],This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!
[OTH],Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!
[OTH],This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
[OTH],"Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it."
[OTH],"Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive."
[OTH],Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
[OTH],"Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes."
[OTH],"Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls."
[OTH],Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
[OTH],"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs."
[OTH],Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves."
Cartman,Wwow!
[OTH],"Dude, that kicks ass!"
Cartman,"Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?"
[OTH],Five dollars for three balls.
Cartman,Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
[OTH],"Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth."
Cartman,That's easy!
[OTH],"Okay, we've got a player!"
Cartman,Ay! Check it out!
Cartman,Damn it!
[OTH],"It's okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper."
Cartman,"Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!"
[OTH],"You suck, Cartman!"
Cartman,I'd like to see you do better!
[OTH],Give me that!
[OTH],Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
[OTH],It's gotta go through her mouth.
[OTH],But ih-
[OTH],"Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars."
[OTH],"Here, give me some money, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Lend me money, fat boy!"
Cartman,"I only have three dollars left, asshole!"
[OTH],Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.
[OTH],"Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows!"
[OTH],"Mom, give me some money!"
[OTH],"Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!"
[OTH],I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
[OTH],"Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets!"
[OTH],I will if you give me money!
[OTH],"Okay, here!"
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows."
[OTH],"With that said, let's rock and roll!"
[OTH],Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!
[OTH],They're loose!
[OTH],Mooooo?!
[OTH],Ow.
[OTH],Yeehaw!
[OTH],Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
Cartman,"I only need one, dude. I only need one."
[OTH],"Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
Cartman,How much is it?
[OTH],"Just three tickets, boys."
[OTH],Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
[OTH],Is it like a- haunted house or something?
[OTH],Sure. It's veery scary.
Cartman,"Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five."
[OTH],"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
Cartman,"Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over."
[OTH],"You'd better be right, dude."
Cartman,I'm right!
[OTH],Keep your hands inside at all times.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!"
Cartman,Eh! God-damnit!
[OTH],What the hell was that?
[OTH],Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!
[OTH],"All right, boys. Ride's over."
[OTH],That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
[OTH],Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
Cartman,I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
[OTH],"That was a waste of money, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets."
[OTH],We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Cartman,"Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money."
Cartman,"Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!"
[OTH],This ride better be good!
[OTH],"Yeah, this line is way too long!"
Cartman,I think we're almost to the end.
[OTH],We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
[OTH],Here we go.
[OTH],Finally!
[OTH],Did ya enjoy the ride?
[OTH],What ride?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line."
[OTH],Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
[OTH],"That's five tickets, thank you very much."
[OTH],Come see us again soon.
[OTH],My ass we will!
[OTH],"Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!"
[OTH],"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again."
[OTH],Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride?
Cartman,How much?
[OTH],Just three dollars.
Cartman,"Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet."
[OTH],"You dumbass, Cartman!"
Cartman,What? This is cool.
[OTH],"No, it's not cool!"
Cartman,"It is, too!"
[OTH],Can I help you boys.
[OTH],We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
[OTH],"O-kay, five dollars for three balls."
[OTH],"How much do we have left, Cartman?"
[OTH],"How much do we have left, Cartman?!"
Cartman,"Aah, three dollars."
[OTH],"What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math."
[OTH],You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
Cartman,Ey! Seriously!
[OTH],"Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry!"
[OTH],"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?"
Cartman,Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
[OTH],(What? These?)
[OTH],Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
[OTH],"Sure, as long as they're good."
[OTH],"Give him your food stamps, Kenny!"
[OTH],(Nuh uh.)
[OTH],"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!"
[OTH],"(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)"
Cartman,"Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!"
[OTH],Okay. Here we go.
[OTH],Hey! That was right on target.
[OTH],"Sorry, kid. Try again."
[OTH],That does it! Shenanigans!
[OTH],SHENANIGANS!
[OTH],Uhwhat are you doing?
[OTH],I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
[OTH],Shenanigans?
[OTH],What's all the hoo-ha?
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
[OTH],"If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just."
[OTH],"What do you have to say, carnival operator?"
[OTH],"Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son."
[OTH],Here you go.
[OTH],"There, you see? We have a winner!"
[OTH],It worked!
[OTH],"Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!"
[OTH],"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby."
[OTH],Barbrady!
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?"
[OTH],You said Buttbaby.
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick."
[OTH],No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
[OTH],"Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade 'em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
[OTH],"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-"
[OTH],"Step on up, just five dollars to play!"
[OTH],"Damnit, I have to have those dolls!"
[OTH],This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
[OTH],"Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000."
[OTH],"Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!"
Cartman,What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
[OTH],"Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open!"
Cartman,"O-kay, I'll get on the bull."
[OTH],"All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!"
[OTH],He really wants those dolls.
Cartman,"I guess, damn!"
[OTH],That ride wasn't very good.
[OTH],"Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time."
[OTH],"You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time."
[OTH],"Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman."
Cartman,"Hey, this is sweet."
[OTH],"You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?"
Cartman,I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
[OTH],We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
Cartman,Ye-gah!
Cartman,Ow!
Cartman,Son of a bitch!
[OTH],How long was that?
[OTH],That wasn't quite ten seconds.
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],"That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that."
Cartman,"You guys, eh seriously, my back!"
[OTH],"Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice!"
Cartman,Seriously. Help.
Cartman,Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
[OTH],"What'd you say, Cartman??"
Cartman,I hate you guys!
[OTH],I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
Cartman,Hate you guys.
[OTH],"Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got."
[OTH],"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull."
[OTH],"Well, have fun, boys."
[OTH],"Okay, Cartman. You ready?"
Cartman,Nnoo.
[OTH],Open the gate!
Cartman,"All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride."
[OTH],That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
Cartman,"Yeah, this is sweet!"
[OTH],What are you going to do?
[OTH],Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball.
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. That's a good idea."
Cartman,Eeyy!
[OTH],That's better.
[OTH],"Hold on, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!"
Cartman,Mother f-
[OTH],"Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!"
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman."
[OTH],"(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)"
[OTH],"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!"
[OTH],Get up!
[OTH],Get UP!
[OTH],"You okay, dude?"
[OTH],"Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?"
[OTH],"Dude, I think we broke him."
[OTH],"Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma."
[OTH],What's the matter with him.
[OTH],"Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li."
[OTH],..Oh.
[OTH],But can he still ride a bull?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
[OTH],"No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep."
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?"
Cartman,"Bân xưa, Lee bân xưa!
(rough translation: Old friends, Lee old friends!)"
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,Boyongture taur lur mahrter.
[OTH],"Oh, he's fine, dude."
[OTH],You think?
Cartman,Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi.
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo."
[OTH],"All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!"
[OTH],"Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked."
[OTH],Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial!
[OTH],Where are we going to put a 60-foot tall statue of a cow?
[OTH],"Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists."
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],How's he doing?
[OTH],He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
Cartman,Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.
[OTH],Do you think he can ride the bull?
[OTH],"Yeah, I think so."
[OTH],Cool.
Cartman,"Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!"
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.
[OTH],"Go away, kid. You're grossing me out."
Cartman,"Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!"
[OTH],"Beat it, kid! Come on, honey."
[OTH],"Come one, come all! The Chamber of Farts has been fixed and is reopen!"
[OTH],"Jesus, dude!"
[OTH],"Hey, where's Cartman?"
[OTH],"Oh, hell!"
[OTH],(I don't know where he went!)
[OTH],"Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride."
[OTH],(Okay.)
[OTH],"Hoh, it's so cold here."
[OTH],Where is that sheriff?! We need water!
[OTH],"Oh well, let's try to make the best of it, Mary."
[OTH],You're right. We're not being positive. At least we get some time alone.
[OTH],"Yeah, and at least we've got our health."
[OTH],"I tell you, Mitchell, I ain't never seen nothin' like it."
[OTH],Where are they again?
[OTH],Just right up over this ridge.
[OTH],"That's what they've been doin' all morning, just sittin' there and mooin'. And more cows come all the time."
[OTH],"Well, I ain't never seen this before, neither. But I know one thing, when cows start gettin' together, it can't be good. They might start formin' a cult!"
[OTH],Hmm. Cow cult.
[OTH],"The grand-daddy of 'em all, the South Park Cow Days Rodeo! Let's begin the bull-riding event. Grand prize: $5000!"
[OTH],"Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!"
[OTH],"(I don't know, can't find him.)"
[OTH],"He's up in, like, twenty minutes!"
[OTH],"(I know, I know!)"
Cartman,"Hello, prease! Hello!"
[OTH],There he is!
Cartman,"Fucky-sucky, five dorrah."
[OTH],"Here they are, just like we told you."
[OTH],"Okay, that's enough-a that! You cows need to dis-perse! All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!"
[OTH],"All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!"
[OTH],"Mmmm-gahyah! Git along, little doggies!"
[OTH],Bad cows stay! Stay!
[OTH],AAAAAH!
[OTH],"Holy crow! Play dead, Ned!"
[OTH],I reckon we should get some help.
[OTH],I reckon.
[OTH],"Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake."
[OTH],"Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!"
Cartman,Fucky-sucky five dollah.
[OTH],"Up first, No. 24, Jack McMack!"
[OTH],"Three, two, one."
[OTH],Yeehaw! Yehoo! Yeehaw!
[OTH],Aaaaaaaa!
[OTH],"Oooh, that's gonna cost him a point deduction. Up next, number 14, Ming Li!"
Cartman,"Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!"
[OTH],Here we go!
[OTH],"Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
[OTH],Let her go!
Cartman,Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!
[OTH],"Hang on, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Wow, and this Vietnamese prostitute can really ride a bull!"
[OTH],"I guess she's had a lot of practice, if you know what I mean."
Cartman,Aaah! Ten dorrah!
Cartman,"Ten dollah, soldier boy!"
[OTH],She's setting a new world record!
[OTH],Ming Li! Ming Li! Ming Li!
Cartman,Gaaah!
Cartman,Heeee!
[OTH],"Dude, that bull's gonna kill him."
[OTH],"Go help him, Kenny!"
[OTH],"(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!)"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],And this brave little whore from the East has really put on a show for us today!
[OTH],"The winner of the bull-riding contest, Ming Li!"
Cartman,"Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar."
[OTH],"We did it, dude, we did it!"
[OTH],"Freeze, cows!"
[OTH],The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns!
[OTH],"You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!"
[OTH],You will now all march in an orderly fashion into this trailer!
[OTH],Move!
[OTH],"Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow!"
[OTH],"Oh, dear Jesus, no!"
[OTH],Mooooo!
[OTH],Nnoo!
[OTH],"They're killing themselves! Stop! Please! Can't we do anything?! Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity!"
[OTH],This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months.
[OTH],"Oh, you boys are back again, huh?"
[OTH],Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
[OTH],How many ball does that get us?
Cartman,Odline daur shunba shunba?
[OTH],"Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh, I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
[OTH],You will?
[OTH],"Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden?"
[OTH],"We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
Cartman,Ten dollah? Sucky-sucky?
[OTH],What are we gonna do with them?
[OTH],We should-
[OTH],..What the-?
[OTH],"Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!"
[OTH],After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS!
[OTH],What's all this?
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!"
[OTH],"You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!"
[OTH],"Yeah, and the food is terrible!"
[OTH],"Hey, it's just a stupid rodeo! What do you expect?"
[OTH],"Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?"
[OTH],..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
[OTH],"Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans!"
[OTH],You found it! You found the memorial!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"And the cows? Are they all back, too?"
[OTH],"They're dead, mayor. They're all dead."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Oho, it was awful! Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!"
[OTH],"Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing."
[OTH],"I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. God I need a cold beer and a burger."
[OTH],What's all the ruckus over there?
[OTH],Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans!
[OTH],"Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!"
[OTH],"All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with- Oooooh?"
[OTH],"Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Didn't we ever release them?
[OTH],"Aw, I forgot all about 'em."
[OTH],"Uh me, too."
[OTH],"Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell."
[OTH],I didn't?
[OTH],"No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them."
[OTH],"Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison."
[OTH],"Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh."
[OTH],"Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh."
Cartman,What are you guys doing?
[OTH],"Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?"
Cartman,"Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night."
[OTH],Really? What about?
Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours."
Cartman,"Hey, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?"
[OTH],Oh-h. Nowhere.
Cartman,Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
[OTH],"No! Cartman, that was just a dream!"
[OTH],"Bye, Ming Li. Thanks again."
Cartman,Oh! Son of a bitch!
[OTH],"Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?"
[OTH],"We're ready, Bob!"
[OTH],Any particular prize you're hoping for?
[OTH],"Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too!"
[OTH],"Oh, anywhere'd be great!"
[OTH],Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum?
[OTH],"Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this."
[OTH],The upper vascular hood.
[OTH],"I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!"
[OTH],Fred tell 'em what they've won.
[OTH],"Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado!"
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],"That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival."
[OTH],"Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!"
[OTH],"Congratulations, Tom and Mary."
[OTH],"Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited."
[OTH],What was second prize again?
[OTH],That's all for now. See you tomorrow on...
[OTH],"Ooo, What The Hell Is That!"
[OTH],Ah shit!
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!"
[OTH],"As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow."
[OTH],"And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!"
[OTH],This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!
[OTH],Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!
[OTH],This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
[OTH],"Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it."
[OTH],"Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive."
[OTH],Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
[OTH],"Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes."
[OTH],"Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls."
[OTH],Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
[OTH],"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs."
[OTH],Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves."
Cartman,Wwow!
[OTH],"Dude, that kicks ass!"
Cartman,"Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?"
[OTH],Five dollars for three balls.
Cartman,Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
[OTH],"Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth."
Cartman,That's easy!
[OTH],"Okay, we've got a player!"
Cartman,Ay! Check it out!
Cartman,Damn it!
[OTH],"It's okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper."
Cartman,"Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!"
[OTH],"You suck, Cartman!"
Cartman,I'd like to see you do better!
[OTH],Give me that!
[OTH],Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
[OTH],It's gotta go through her mouth.
[OTH],But ih-
[OTH],"Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars."
[OTH],"Here, give me some money, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Lend me money, fat boy!"
Cartman,"I only have three dollars left, asshole!"
[OTH],Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.
[OTH],"Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows!"
[OTH],"Mom, give me some money!"
[OTH],"Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!"
[OTH],I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
[OTH],"Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets!"
[OTH],I will if you give me money!
[OTH],"Okay, here!"
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows."
[OTH],"With that said, let's rock and roll!"
[OTH],Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!
[OTH],They're loose!
[OTH],Mooooo?!
[OTH],Ow.
[OTH],Yeehaw!
[OTH],Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
Cartman,"I only need one, dude. I only need one."
[OTH],"Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
Cartman,How much is it?
[OTH],"Just three tickets, boys."
[OTH],Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
[OTH],Is it like a- haunted house or something?
[OTH],Sure. It's veery scary.
Cartman,"Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five."
[OTH],"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
Cartman,"Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over."
[OTH],"You'd better be right, dude."
Cartman,I'm right!
[OTH],Keep your hands inside at all times.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!"
Cartman,Eh! God-damnit!
[OTH],What the hell was that?
[OTH],Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!
[OTH],"All right, boys. Ride's over."
[OTH],That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
[OTH],Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
Cartman,I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
[OTH],"That was a waste of money, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets."
[OTH],We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Cartman,"Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money."
Cartman,"Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!"
[OTH],This ride better be good!
[OTH],"Yeah, this line is way too long!"
Cartman,I think we're almost to the end.
[OTH],We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
[OTH],Here we go.
[OTH],Finally!
[OTH],Did ya enjoy the ride?
[OTH],What ride?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line."
[OTH],Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
[OTH],"That's five tickets, thank you very much."
[OTH],Come see us again soon.
[OTH],My ass we will!
[OTH],"Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!"
[OTH],"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again."
[OTH],Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride?
Cartman,How much?
[OTH],Just three dollars.
Cartman,"Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet."
[OTH],"You dumbass, Cartman!"
Cartman,What? This is cool.
[OTH],"No, it's not cool!"
Cartman,"It is, too!"
[OTH],Can I help you boys.
[OTH],We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
[OTH],"O-kay, five dollars for three balls."
[OTH],"How much do we have left, Cartman?"
[OTH],"How much do we have left, Cartman?!"
Cartman,"Aah, three dollars."
[OTH],"What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math."
[OTH],You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
Cartman,Ey! Seriously!
[OTH],"Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry!"
[OTH],"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?"
Cartman,Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
[OTH],(What? These?)
[OTH],Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
[OTH],"Sure, as long as they're good."
[OTH],"Give him your food stamps, Kenny!"
[OTH],(Nuh uh.)
[OTH],"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!"
[OTH],"(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)"
Cartman,"Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!"
[OTH],Okay. Here we go.
[OTH],Hey! That was right on target.
[OTH],"Sorry, kid. Try again."
[OTH],That does it! Shenanigans!
[OTH],SHENANIGANS!
[OTH],Uhwhat are you doing?
[OTH],I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
[OTH],Shenanigans?
[OTH],What's all the hoo-ha?
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
[OTH],"If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just."
[OTH],"What do you have to say, carnival operator?"
[OTH],"Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son."
[OTH],Here you go.
[OTH],"There, you see? We have a winner!"
[OTH],It worked!
[OTH],"Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!"
[OTH],"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby."
[OTH],Barbrady!
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?"
[OTH],You said Buttbaby.
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick."
[OTH],No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
[OTH],"Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade 'em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
[OTH],"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-"
[OTH],"Step on up, just five dollars to play!"
[OTH],"Damnit, I have to have those dolls!"
[OTH],This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
[OTH],"Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000."
[OTH],"Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!"
Cartman,What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
[OTH],"Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open!"
Cartman,"O-kay, I'll get on the bull."
[OTH],"All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!"
[OTH],He really wants those dolls.
Cartman,"I guess, damn!"
[OTH],That ride wasn't very good.
[OTH],"Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time."
[OTH],"You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time."
[OTH],"Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman."
Cartman,"Hey, this is sweet."
[OTH],"You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?"
Cartman,I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
[OTH],We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
Cartman,Ye-gah!
Cartman,Ow!
Cartman,Son of a bitch!
[OTH],How long was that?
[OTH],That wasn't quite ten seconds.
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],"That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that."
Cartman,"You guys, eh seriously, my back!"
[OTH],"Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice!"
Cartman,Seriously. Help.
Cartman,Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
[OTH],"What'd you say, Cartman??"
Cartman,I hate you guys!
[OTH],I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
Cartman,Hate you guys.
[OTH],"Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got."
[OTH],"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull."
[OTH],"Well, have fun, boys."
[OTH],"Okay, Cartman. You ready?"
Cartman,Nnoo.
[OTH],Open the gate!
Cartman,"All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride."
[OTH],That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
Cartman,"Yeah, this is sweet!"
[OTH],What are you going to do?
[OTH],Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball.
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. That's a good idea."
Cartman,Eeyy!
[OTH],That's better.
[OTH],"Hold on, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!"
Cartman,Mother f-
[OTH],"Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!"
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman."
[OTH],"(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)"
[OTH],"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!"
[OTH],Get up!
[OTH],Get UP!
[OTH],"You okay, dude?"
[OTH],"Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?"
[OTH],"Dude, I think we broke him."
[OTH],"Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma."
[OTH],What's the matter with him.
[OTH],"Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li."
[OTH],..Oh.
[OTH],But can he still ride a bull?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
[OTH],"No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep."
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?"
Cartman,"Bân xưa, Lee bân xưa!
(rough translation: Old friends, Lee old friends!)"
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,Boyongture taur lur mahrter.
[OTH],"Oh, he's fine, dude."
[OTH],You think?
Cartman,Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi.
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo."
[OTH],"All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!"
[OTH],"Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked."
[OTH],Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial!
[OTH],Where are we going to put a 60-foot tall statue of a cow?
[OTH],"Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists."
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],How's he doing?
[OTH],He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
Cartman,Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.
[OTH],Do you think he can ride the bull?
[OTH],"Yeah, I think so."
[OTH],Cool.
Cartman,"Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!"
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.
[OTH],"Go away, kid. You're grossing me out."
Cartman,"Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!"
[OTH],"Beat it, kid! Come on, honey."
[OTH],"Come one, come all! The Chamber of Farts has been fixed and is reopen!"
[OTH],"Jesus, dude!"
[OTH],"Hey, where's Cartman?"
[OTH],"Oh, hell!"
[OTH],(I don't know where he went!)
[OTH],"Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride."
[OTH],(Okay.)
[OTH],"Hoh, it's so cold here."
[OTH],Where is that sheriff?! We need water!
[OTH],"Oh well, let's try to make the best of it, Mary."
[OTH],You're right. We're not being positive. At least we get some time alone.
[OTH],"Yeah, and at least we've got our health."
[OTH],"I tell you, Mitchell, I ain't never seen nothin' like it."
[OTH],Where are they again?
[OTH],Just right up over this ridge.
[OTH],"That's what they've been doin' all morning, just sittin' there and mooin'. And more cows come all the time."
[OTH],"Well, I ain't never seen this before, neither. But I know one thing, when cows start gettin' together, it can't be good. They might start formin' a cult!"
[OTH],Hmm. Cow cult.
[OTH],"The grand-daddy of 'em all, the South Park Cow Days Rodeo! Let's begin the bull-riding event. Grand prize: $5000!"
[OTH],"Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!"
[OTH],"(I don't know, can't find him.)"
[OTH],"He's up in, like, twenty minutes!"
[OTH],"(I know, I know!)"
Cartman,"Hello, prease! Hello!"
[OTH],There he is!
Cartman,"Fucky-sucky, five dorrah."
[OTH],"Here they are, just like we told you."
[OTH],"Okay, that's enough-a that! You cows need to dis-perse! All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!"
[OTH],"All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!"
[OTH],"Mmmm-gahyah! Git along, little doggies!"
[OTH],Bad cows stay! Stay!
[OTH],AAAAAH!
[OTH],"Holy crow! Play dead, Ned!"
[OTH],I reckon we should get some help.
[OTH],I reckon.
[OTH],"Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake."
[OTH],"Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!"
Cartman,Fucky-sucky five dollah.
[OTH],"Up first, No. 24, Jack McMack!"
[OTH],"Three, two, one."
[OTH],Yeehaw! Yehoo! Yeehaw!
[OTH],Aaaaaaaa!
[OTH],"Oooh, that's gonna cost him a point deduction. Up next, number 14, Ming Li!"
Cartman,"Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!"
[OTH],Here we go!
[OTH],"Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
[OTH],Let her go!
Cartman,Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!
[OTH],"Hang on, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Wow, and this Vietnamese prostitute can really ride a bull!"
[OTH],"I guess she's had a lot of practice, if you know what I mean."
Cartman,Aaah! Ten dorrah!
Cartman,"Ten dollah, soldier boy!"
[OTH],She's setting a new world record!
[OTH],Ming Li! Ming Li! Ming Li!
Cartman,Gaaah!
Cartman,Heeee!
[OTH],"Dude, that bull's gonna kill him."
[OTH],"Go help him, Kenny!"
[OTH],"(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!)"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],And this brave little whore from the East has really put on a show for us today!
[OTH],"The winner of the bull-riding contest, Ming Li!"
Cartman,"Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar."
[OTH],"We did it, dude, we did it!"
[OTH],"Freeze, cows!"
[OTH],The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns!
[OTH],"You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!"
[OTH],You will now all march in an orderly fashion into this trailer!
[OTH],Move!
[OTH],"Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow!"
[OTH],"Oh, dear Jesus, no!"
[OTH],Mooooo!
[OTH],Nnoo!
[OTH],"They're killing themselves! Stop! Please! Can't we do anything?! Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity!"
[OTH],This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months.
[OTH],"Oh, you boys are back again, huh?"
[OTH],Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
[OTH],How many ball does that get us?
Cartman,Odline daur shunba shunba?
[OTH],"Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh, I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
[OTH],You will?
[OTH],"Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden?"
[OTH],"We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
Cartman,Ten dollah? Sucky-sucky?
[OTH],What are we gonna do with them?
[OTH],We should-
[OTH],..What the-?
[OTH],"Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!"
[OTH],After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS!
[OTH],What's all this?
[OTH],"Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!"
[OTH],"You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!"
[OTH],"Yeah, and the food is terrible!"
[OTH],"Hey, it's just a stupid rodeo! What do you expect?"
[OTH],"Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?"
[OTH],..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
[OTH],"Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans!"
[OTH],You found it! You found the memorial!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"And the cows? Are they all back, too?"
[OTH],"They're dead, mayor. They're all dead."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Oho, it was awful! Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!"
[OTH],"Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing."
[OTH],"I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. God I need a cold beer and a burger."
[OTH],What's all the ruckus over there?
[OTH],Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans!
[OTH],"Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!"
[OTH],"All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with- Oooooh?"
[OTH],"Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Didn't we ever release them?
[OTH],"Aw, I forgot all about 'em."
[OTH],"Uh me, too."
[OTH],"Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell."
[OTH],I didn't?
[OTH],"No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them."
[OTH],"Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison."
[OTH],"Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh."
[OTH],"Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh."
Cartman,What are you guys doing?
[OTH],"Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?"
Cartman,"Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night."
[OTH],Really? What about?
Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours."
Cartman,"Hey, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?"
[OTH],Oh-h. Nowhere.
Cartman,Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
[OTH],"No! Cartman, that was just a dream!"
[OTH],"Bye, Ming Li. Thanks again."
Cartman,Oh! Son of a bitch!
Cartman,"Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches
Stinky, stinky britches,
you got stinky--"
[OTH],"What the hell are you singing, Cartman?"
Cartman,"This new song by Alanis Morissette. I can’t get it out of my head. 
Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches"
[OTH],"Hello, children. Ready for lunch?"
Cartman,"Stinky britches,
you got stinky,
stinky--"
[OTH],"Eric, is there a problem?"
Cartman,"Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head."
[OTH],"""Stinky Britches"" by Alanis Morissette?"
Cartman,"Yeah. 
Stinky,
stinky britches"
[OTH],"Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?"
[OTH],"Hi, boys. How are you?"
[OTH],When is Mr. Hat coming back?
[OTH],I told you never say his name in my presence.
[OTH],But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Stinky britches,
you got stinky--"
[OTH],"It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--"
[OTH],He'd be better used as a coat rack.
[OTH],"How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig."
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
Cartman,"You got stinky britches,
stinky--"
[OTH],What did you say?
[OTH],He singing some new hit song.
[OTH],"Eric, where did you hear that song?"
Cartman,"It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere."
[OTH],"Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas."
[OTH],"What, dude?"
[OTH],"Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago."
Cartman,You wrote it?
[OTH],Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
[OTH],"Wow, then you should get money for it!"
[OTH],"Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all."
[OTH],"Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time."
[OTH],"Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song."
[OTH],"Stinky britches,
you got those stinky britches."
[OTH],"So you see, Mr. Big record producer, ""Stinky Britches"" was something I wrote several years ago."
[OTH],"Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and ""Stinky Britches"" by our artist, Alanis Morissette."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],It’s the same goddamn song!
[OTH],"Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!"
[OTH],I am above the law!
[OTH],"Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you."
[OTH],"Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and you’re gonna sue me?"
[OTH],Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.
[OTH],We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
Cartman,"Yeah, and he’s Jewish."
[OTH],"Stinky,
stinky britches,
stinky britches"
[OTH],"Mr. Twig, is that you?"
[OTH],Mis-Mr. Twig?
[OTH],Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!
[OTH],"Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!"
[OTH],"Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down."
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],This court is now in session. Who's representing the defense?
[OTH],"I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski."
[OTH],And representing the prosecution?
[OTH],"I am, Your Honor."
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],"Why ""uh-oh""?"
[OTH],"Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O.J. off."
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!
[OTH],Give the child to me.
[OTH],"Is he going to be all right, doctor?"
[OTH],Uhhh...
[OTH],Is he going to live?
[OTH],It's a stick.
[OTH],"...Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!"
[OTH],"And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the...day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous ""Chewbacca defense""?"
Cartman,"What's a ""Chewbacca defense""?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial.
Cartman,"Goddamn, I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, ""Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"""
[OTH],"I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman."
[OTH],"...And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you."
[OTH],We've got 'em.
[OTH],"Mr. Johnnie Cochran, your closing arguments."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote ""Stinky Britches"" ten years ago, and they make a good case... hell, I almost felt pity myself. But, ladies and gentlemen, of this supposed jury, I have one, final thing I want you to consider."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentleman, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does not make sense."
[OTH],Dammit..!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],He’s using the Chewbacca defense.
[OTH],"Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: ""What does this have to do with this case?"" Nothing."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense! Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests."
[OTH],"O-kay, then."
Cartman,"Wow, he’s good."
[OTH],"In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense."
[OTH],Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide.
[OTH],How find you the jury?
[OTH],"We find the defendant, Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy... guilty as charged."
[OTH],Whoops.
[OTH],Whoops?!
[OTH],"Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label. The full fee of two million dollars will be handed over within 24 hours."
[OTH],Do I look like I have two million?
[OTH],"Well, you have 24 hours to find it, or else you have to go to jail. For eight million years."
[OTH],"Uh, it's actually for four years."
[OTH],"Oh, sorry. You'll got to jail for four years."
[OTH],This can't be happening..!
[OTH],"Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail."
[OTH],"And that chair, too. I want that chair."
[OTH],"Hey, that's my favorite chair!"
[OTH],"You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too."
[OTH],"Hello there, Chef."
[OTH],"Hey, children."
[OTH],What's going on?
[OTH],"Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with two million, I'm going to jail."
[OTH],"Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up."
[OTH],"Yeah. Ready, Cartman?"
Cartman,Ready.
Cartman,"I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la
I hope my will enjoy my dance
Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
Would you like some sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--"
[OTH],"Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better."
[OTH],You do?
[OTH],Sure. Just please stop.
Cartman,See? I told you guys it would work.
[OTH],"What's that, dude?"
[OTH],This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
[OTH],Did you ever know any famous people?
[OTH],"Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women."
Cartman,What's that?
[OTH],Nothing.
[OTH],Anyway--
[OTH],"Take this, too."
[OTH],Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
[OTH],I can take whatever I want.
[OTH],But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!
[OTH],I am above the law!
[OTH],I told you not to mess with me.
[OTH],"That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that two million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!"
[OTH],You wouldn’t.
[OTH],Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!
[OTH],"I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better? I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever. Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..?"
[OTH],Aaaggghhh!!
[OTH],Who did this?!
[OTH],"You won't get away with this, you bastards!"
[OTH],"Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran. Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million."
[OTH],"Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich."
[OTH],"Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them."
[OTH],"You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you."
[OTH],"I appreciate that, children, but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do."
[OTH],My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.
[OTH],"Wish me luck, children."
[OTH],"We've gotta help him, dude."
[OTH],"Yeah, b-but how?"
[OTH],Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, this house is huge."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass."
Cartman,"No, it isn't, you guys."
[OTH],Can I help you?
Cartman,"We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef."
Cartman,Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
[OTH],Are you Elton John?
[OTH],"No, I’m one of his butlers."
[OTH],"Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys."
[OTH],"Hi, are you Elton John?"
[OTH],"Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know."
[OTH],We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
Cartman,We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies...
[OTH],"I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
[OTH],Chef? You mean Chef-Chef?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude."
[OTH],"Wow, you remember him?"
[OTH],Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago.
[OTH],I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break.
[OTH],"Oh, oh, you're my cheddar cheese girl
You're soft but firm,
and you go well with wine.
Oh oh, cheddar cheese girl
Cheddar, cheddar cheese girl"
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],"Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up."
[OTH],"Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing."
[OTH],"Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics."
[OTH],"I really thought I had it this time with ""Cheddar Cheese Girl""."
[OTH],What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
[OTH],That's a great idea!
[OTH],"And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know, some slick glasses and shit."
[OTH],"And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music."
[OTH],So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
[OTH],"Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums."
Cartman,Three Crispy Yum Yums.
[OTH],"Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?"
[OTH],"Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights, including-but-not-limited-to-Asian-territories, with-a-twenty-percent-commission-from-all-domestic-sales, and-sole-ownership-of-any-and-all-publishing."
[OTH],'Kay.
[OTH],Tell Chef I said hi.
[OTH],"Thanks, dude."
[OTH],"Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!"
[OTH],"Oy..! Thank you, Chef."
[OTH],"No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?"
[OTH],"Oh, of course!"
[OTH],Here you go.
[OTH],Leaving so soon?
[OTH],I have a loooooong way to go to raise the kind of money I need.
[OTH],"Well, best of luck to you, then."
[OTH],"How was it, honey?"
[OTH],Pretty much what I expected.
[OTH],"Hello, are you Meat Loaf?"
[OTH],Yeah. What the hell do you want?
Cartman,"Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend."
[OTH],"He’s not dying, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Shut your goddamn mouth. We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--"
[OTH],What's this for?
[OTH],"Our friend, Chef."
[OTH],Chef's in trouble?
[OTH],Yeah. Do you know him?
[OTH],Do I?
[OTH],Nobody came again.
[OTH],"There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name."
[OTH],"Beefy? Like, uhh… Tri-tip!"
[OTH],"That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf."
[OTH],I owe everything to Chef.
[OTH],Wow! So you'll help him?
[OTH],You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum Yums and a couple of Berry Bars.
[OTH],Cool!
[OTH],"All right, let's get this show on the road! Come here, baby!"
[OTH],"Uh-uh, hold on a second, Veronica Crabtree. How would you like to use some... sex toys?"
[OTH],Sex toys? Like what?
[OTH],Like this very special device.
[OTH],"I call it ""Chef’s pleasure bag""."
[OTH],How does it work?
[OTH],"Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure."
[OTH],"Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot."
[OTH],"Ahh, yeah. That's much better."
[OTH],Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers.
[OTH],"Gosh, thanks, Rick James."
[OTH],"Yeah, thanks. That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!"
[OTH],"Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show."
[OTH],I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.
[OTH],"Oh, come on, buck up, little fella."
[OTH],I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.
[OTH],"Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp."
[OTH],"Aw, hell!"
[OTH],"Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],What's this all about?
[OTH],"These pictures just arrived. I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed. Now, go arrest him!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Can I go now?
[OTH],"Yes—Yes, I’m sorry."
[OTH],Weirdo.
[OTH],It can't be. These can't be right.
[OTH],Mr. Hat!
[OTH],Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
[OTH],"It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail."
[OTH],"No, you don't!"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
[OTH],Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,"Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated hyeeah."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
[OTH],"I made about $410,300, but--"
[OTH],"That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!"
[OTH],You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
[OTH],I am above the law!
[OTH],"All right, you, it's time to go."
[OTH],"Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help."
[OTH],Let's go.
[OTH],Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
[OTH],"I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine."
[OTH],Ow! Ow!
[OTH],Dude... Chef is gone.
[OTH],No more Chef.
Cartman,No more Salisbury steak and... pecan pie.
[OTH],"We can't let him down, you guys."
[OTH],"Dude, it's over. He's gone."
[OTH],No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
Cartman,Four.
[OTH],But what are we gonna do?
[OTH],"It's easy, dude. Chef Aid."
[OTH],Chef Aid?
[OTH],"Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets."
[OTH],"Hey, that's a great idea!"
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],"Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left."
[OTH],I'm not going to take you back.
[OTH],You can just go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
[OTH],"You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!"
[OTH],"...I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!"
[OTH],What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
[OTH],"It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake."
[OTH],What? Jail?
Cartman,"I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la"
Cartman,"I hope my will enjoy my dance,"
Cartman,"Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay"
[OTH],Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
[OTH],"Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Would you like sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut,
Fräulein Setski."
[OTH],"Howdy ho, boys."
[OTH],Elton John! What are you doing here?
[OTH],It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef.
[OTH],"Boy, do we!"
[OTH],"So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over."
[OTH],"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],I see you've got a stage all set up for us.
[OTH],"Yeah, dude, it's all yours."
[OTH],"Then, let’s rock and roll! Or something similar."
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],"...And Mr. Twig is at home, he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history."
[OTH],"You finally snapped, huh, Garrison?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies."
[OTH],"I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Okay, thanks for coming to Chef Aid, everybody! Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?!"
[OTH],Whoo!
[OTH],"All right, let's get things going with... Rancid! Ran-cid!"
[OTH],California sun has sunk
[OTH],"Behind the Anaheim Hills,
here it comes tonight"
[OTH],I was hiiiiiigh on junk--
[OTH],"You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef?"
[OTH],"No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!"
[OTH],That's good.
[OTH],What the?
[OTH],"Oh, boy, we're free!"
[OTH],"Wow, what a daring rescue."
[OTH],"Mr. Hat! Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!"
[OTH],"Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
[OTH],Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm
[OTH],"Rick James, ladies and gentlemen!"
[OTH],"God bless you, Chef!"
[OTH],"And now here's your favorite band, Primus! Whoo!"
[OTH],"We're damned proud to be here to support our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who told us in the early days, to keep trying and to keep pursuing our dreams, no matter how much we sucked. I love that man."
[OTH],Whooaa..!
[OTH],What are you bastards doing?
[OTH],We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
Cartman,Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
[OTH],"Oh, yeah? We’ll just see about this!"
[OTH],"And now, here’s Joe Strummer!  Whoo!"
[OTH],"You know, when The Clash were on tour and we lost the beat, Chef would be like at the side of the stage going, ""Don't forget, pump your loins, children."" You know, that was like his motto or something."
[OTH],Whoo!
[OTH],"Well, it's a rockin' world
Make no mistake about it"
[OTH],It's a shocking world
[OTH],"Could be what's so great about it
It's a rockin' world..."
[OTH],What the hell is this?
[OTH],"Welcome to Chef Aid, Chef!"
[OTH],"Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?"
[OTH],"Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?"
[OTH],"Well, we helped."
[OTH],"We’re gonna raise your money, Chef."
[OTH],I don’t believe it!
[OTH],We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts.
[OTH],"And now, here he is TV's Ozzy Osbourne!"
[OTH],"We're all here to help our good friend, Chef, who has touched our lives in the past."
[OTH],"I remember when I was just starting out, Chef suggested I buy a pompadour hat. I thought he said, ""Bite the head off a bat"", so I did. And the rest, oh, it's just history. Now, let's go crazyyy!"
[OTH],Ain't nowhere to run!
[OTH],Ain't nowhere to hide!
[OTH],Aarrggghhh!!!
[OTH],"(All right dude, let me go now!)"
[OTH],"Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],And now here’s Ween!
[OTH],We're thrilled to be part of Chef Aid.
[OTH],Chef was the guy who told us to do a country album.
[OTH],"No, dude, that was Steve's idea."
[OTH],Oh. Then who's Chef?
[OTH],"I don't know, dude. I thought you knew him."
[OTH],"Oh, well. Anyways, here's our song!"
[OTH],"Many colors in the homo rainbow
Don't be afraid to let your colors shine shiiiiiiiiiiine"
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you."
[OTH],Did you love him?
[OTH],It doesn't matter. He left me.
[OTH],Did you love him?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Then run to him.
[OTH],But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision.
[OTH],"Love isn't a decision, it’s a feeling. If we could decide who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical."
[OTH],"I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you."
[OTH],"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Whoo!"
[OTH],"Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy. I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend."
[OTH],"Wake up, Wendy!"
[OTH],Smell the coffee...
[OTH],"Hey, that's your song for Wendy!"
Cartman,"Ha-ha, you're a wuss."
[OTH],"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!"
[OTH],"And what happened then? Well, in South Park they say..."
[OTH],Johnnie Cochran's heart grew three sizes that day.
[OTH],"Wait! Mr. Chef, this music has really touched me. I like to take up your case, free of charge!"
[OTH],You will?
[OTH],I will.
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer."
[OTH],Noooooooo!
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client, Chef. I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, this..."
[OTH],"...is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one minute. That does not make sense. Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line? Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!"
[OTH],"Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey."
[OTH],"Chef, how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, ""Stinky Britches""?"
[OTH],"It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children."
[OTH],"So, what are you gonna do now?"
[OTH],Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
Cartman,Hooray!
Cartman,"Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches
Stinky, stinky britches,
you got stinky--"
[OTH],"What the hell are you singing, Cartman?"
Cartman,"This new song by Alanis Morissette. I can’t get it out of my head. 
Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches"
[OTH],"Hello, children. Ready for lunch?"
Cartman,"Stinky britches,
you got stinky,
stinky--"
[OTH],"Eric, is there a problem?"
Cartman,"Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head."
[OTH],"""Stinky Britches"" by Alanis Morissette?"
Cartman,"Yeah. 
Stinky,
stinky britches"
[OTH],"Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?"
[OTH],"Hi, boys. How are you?"
[OTH],When is Mr. Hat coming back?
[OTH],I told you never say his name in my presence.
[OTH],But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Stinky britches,
you got stinky--"
[OTH],"It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--"
[OTH],He'd be better used as a coat rack.
[OTH],"How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig."
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
Cartman,"You got stinky britches,
stinky--"
[OTH],What did you say?
[OTH],He singing some new hit song.
[OTH],"Eric, where did you hear that song?"
Cartman,"It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere."
[OTH],"Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas."
[OTH],"What, dude?"
[OTH],"Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago."
Cartman,You wrote it?
[OTH],Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
[OTH],"Wow, then you should get money for it!"
[OTH],"Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all."
[OTH],"Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time."
[OTH],"Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song."
[OTH],"Stinky britches,
you got those stinky britches."
[OTH],"So you see, Mr. Big record producer, ""Stinky Britches"" was something I wrote several years ago."
[OTH],"Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and ""Stinky Britches"" by our artist, Alanis Morissette."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],It’s the same goddamn song!
[OTH],"Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!"
[OTH],I am above the law!
[OTH],"Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you."
[OTH],"Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and you’re gonna sue me?"
[OTH],Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.
[OTH],We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
Cartman,"Yeah, and he’s Jewish."
[OTH],"Stinky,
stinky britches,
stinky britches"
[OTH],"Mr. Twig, is that you?"
[OTH],Mis-Mr. Twig?
[OTH],Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!
[OTH],"Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!"
[OTH],"Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down."
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],This court is now in session. Who's representing the defense?
[OTH],"I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski."
[OTH],And representing the prosecution?
[OTH],"I am, Your Honor."
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],"Why ""uh-oh""?"
[OTH],"Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O.J. off."
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!
[OTH],Give the child to me.
[OTH],"Is he going to be all right, doctor?"
[OTH],Uhhh...
[OTH],Is he going to live?
[OTH],It's a stick.
[OTH],"...Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!"
[OTH],"And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the...day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous ""Chewbacca defense""?"
Cartman,"What's a ""Chewbacca defense""?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial.
Cartman,"Goddamn, I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, ""Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"""
[OTH],"I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman."
[OTH],"...And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you."
[OTH],We've got 'em.
[OTH],"Mr. Johnnie Cochran, your closing arguments."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote ""Stinky Britches"" ten years ago, and they make a good case... hell, I almost felt pity myself. But, ladies and gentlemen, of this supposed jury, I have one, final thing I want you to consider."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentleman, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does not make sense."
[OTH],Dammit..!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],He’s using the Chewbacca defense.
[OTH],"Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: ""What does this have to do with this case?"" Nothing."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense! Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests."
[OTH],"O-kay, then."
Cartman,"Wow, he’s good."
[OTH],"In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense."
[OTH],Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide.
[OTH],How find you the jury?
[OTH],"We find the defendant, Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy... guilty as charged."
[OTH],Whoops.
[OTH],Whoops?!
[OTH],"Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label. The full fee of two million dollars will be handed over within 24 hours."
[OTH],Do I look like I have two million?
[OTH],"Well, you have 24 hours to find it, or else you have to go to jail. For eight million years."
[OTH],"Uh, it's actually for four years."
[OTH],"Oh, sorry. You'll got to jail for four years."
[OTH],This can't be happening..!
[OTH],"Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail."
[OTH],"And that chair, too. I want that chair."
[OTH],"Hey, that's my favorite chair!"
[OTH],"You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too."
[OTH],"Hello there, Chef."
[OTH],"Hey, children."
[OTH],What's going on?
[OTH],"Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with two million, I'm going to jail."
[OTH],"Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up."
[OTH],"Yeah. Ready, Cartman?"
Cartman,Ready.
Cartman,"I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la
I hope my will enjoy my dance
Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
Would you like some sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--"
[OTH],"Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better."
[OTH],You do?
[OTH],Sure. Just please stop.
Cartman,See? I told you guys it would work.
[OTH],"What's that, dude?"
[OTH],This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
[OTH],Did you ever know any famous people?
[OTH],"Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women."
Cartman,What's that?
[OTH],Nothing.
[OTH],Anyway--
[OTH],"Take this, too."
[OTH],Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
[OTH],I can take whatever I want.
[OTH],But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!
[OTH],I am above the law!
[OTH],I told you not to mess with me.
[OTH],"That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that two million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!"
[OTH],You wouldn’t.
[OTH],Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!
[OTH],"I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better? I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever. Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..?"
[OTH],Aaaggghhh!!
[OTH],Who did this?!
[OTH],"You won't get away with this, you bastards!"
[OTH],"Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran. Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million."
[OTH],"Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich."
[OTH],"Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them."
[OTH],"You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you."
[OTH],"I appreciate that, children, but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do."
[OTH],My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.
[OTH],"Wish me luck, children."
[OTH],"We've gotta help him, dude."
[OTH],"Yeah, b-but how?"
[OTH],Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, this house is huge."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass."
Cartman,"No, it isn't, you guys."
[OTH],Can I help you?
Cartman,"We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef."
Cartman,Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
[OTH],Are you Elton John?
[OTH],"No, I’m one of his butlers."
[OTH],"Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys."
[OTH],"Hi, are you Elton John?"
[OTH],"Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know."
[OTH],We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
Cartman,We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies...
[OTH],"I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
[OTH],Chef? You mean Chef-Chef?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude."
[OTH],"Wow, you remember him?"
[OTH],Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago.
[OTH],I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break.
[OTH],"Oh, oh, you're my cheddar cheese girl
You're soft but firm,
and you go well with wine.
Oh oh, cheddar cheese girl
Cheddar, cheddar cheese girl"
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],"Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up."
[OTH],"Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing."
[OTH],"Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics."
[OTH],"I really thought I had it this time with ""Cheddar Cheese Girl""."
[OTH],What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
[OTH],That's a great idea!
[OTH],"And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know, some slick glasses and shit."
[OTH],"And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music."
[OTH],So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
[OTH],"Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums."
Cartman,Three Crispy Yum Yums.
[OTH],"Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?"
[OTH],"Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights, including-but-not-limited-to-Asian-territories, with-a-twenty-percent-commission-from-all-domestic-sales, and-sole-ownership-of-any-and-all-publishing."
[OTH],'Kay.
[OTH],Tell Chef I said hi.
[OTH],"Thanks, dude."
[OTH],"Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!"
[OTH],"Oy..! Thank you, Chef."
[OTH],"No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?"
[OTH],"Oh, of course!"
[OTH],Here you go.
[OTH],Leaving so soon?
[OTH],I have a loooooong way to go to raise the kind of money I need.
[OTH],"Well, best of luck to you, then."
[OTH],"How was it, honey?"
[OTH],Pretty much what I expected.
[OTH],"Hello, are you Meat Loaf?"
[OTH],Yeah. What the hell do you want?
Cartman,"Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend."
[OTH],"He’s not dying, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Shut your goddamn mouth. We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--"
[OTH],What's this for?
[OTH],"Our friend, Chef."
[OTH],Chef's in trouble?
[OTH],Yeah. Do you know him?
[OTH],Do I?
[OTH],Nobody came again.
[OTH],"There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name."
[OTH],"Beefy? Like, uhh… Tri-tip!"
[OTH],"That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf."
[OTH],I owe everything to Chef.
[OTH],Wow! So you'll help him?
[OTH],You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum Yums and a couple of Berry Bars.
[OTH],Cool!
[OTH],"All right, let's get this show on the road! Come here, baby!"
[OTH],"Uh-uh, hold on a second, Veronica Crabtree. How would you like to use some... sex toys?"
[OTH],Sex toys? Like what?
[OTH],Like this very special device.
[OTH],"I call it ""Chef’s pleasure bag""."
[OTH],How does it work?
[OTH],"Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure."
[OTH],"Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot."
[OTH],"Ahh, yeah. That's much better."
[OTH],Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers.
[OTH],"Gosh, thanks, Rick James."
[OTH],"Yeah, thanks. That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!"
[OTH],"Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show."
[OTH],I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.
[OTH],"Oh, come on, buck up, little fella."
[OTH],I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.
[OTH],"Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp."
[OTH],"Aw, hell!"
[OTH],"Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],What's this all about?
[OTH],"These pictures just arrived. I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed. Now, go arrest him!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Can I go now?
[OTH],"Yes—Yes, I’m sorry."
[OTH],Weirdo.
[OTH],It can't be. These can't be right.
[OTH],Mr. Hat!
[OTH],Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
[OTH],"It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail."
[OTH],"No, you don't!"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
[OTH],Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,"Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated hyeeah."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
[OTH],"I made about $410,300, but--"
[OTH],"That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!"
[OTH],You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
[OTH],I am above the law!
[OTH],"All right, you, it's time to go."
[OTH],"Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help."
[OTH],Let's go.
[OTH],Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
[OTH],"I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine."
[OTH],Ow! Ow!
[OTH],Dude... Chef is gone.
[OTH],No more Chef.
Cartman,No more Salisbury steak and... pecan pie.
[OTH],"We can't let him down, you guys."
[OTH],"Dude, it's over. He's gone."
[OTH],No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
Cartman,Four.
[OTH],But what are we gonna do?
[OTH],"It's easy, dude. Chef Aid."
[OTH],Chef Aid?
[OTH],"Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets."
[OTH],"Hey, that's a great idea!"
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],"Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left."
[OTH],I'm not going to take you back.
[OTH],You can just go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
[OTH],"You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!"
[OTH],"...I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!"
[OTH],What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
[OTH],"It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake."
[OTH],What? Jail?
Cartman,"I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la"
Cartman,"I hope my will enjoy my dance,"
Cartman,"Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay"
[OTH],Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
[OTH],"Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Would you like sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut,
Fräulein Setski."
[OTH],"Howdy ho, boys."
[OTH],Elton John! What are you doing here?
[OTH],It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef.
[OTH],"Boy, do we!"
[OTH],"So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over."
[OTH],"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],I see you've got a stage all set up for us.
[OTH],"Yeah, dude, it's all yours."
[OTH],"Then, let’s rock and roll! Or something similar."
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],"...And Mr. Twig is at home, he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history."
[OTH],"You finally snapped, huh, Garrison?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies."
[OTH],"I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Okay, thanks for coming to Chef Aid, everybody! Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?!"
[OTH],Whoo!
[OTH],"All right, let's get things going with... Rancid! Ran-cid!"
[OTH],California sun has sunk
[OTH],"Behind the Anaheim Hills,
here it comes tonight"
[OTH],I was hiiiiiigh on junk--
[OTH],"You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef?"
[OTH],"No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!"
[OTH],That's good.
[OTH],What the?
[OTH],"Oh, boy, we're free!"
[OTH],"Wow, what a daring rescue."
[OTH],"Mr. Hat! Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!"
[OTH],"Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
[OTH],Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm
[OTH],"Rick James, ladies and gentlemen!"
[OTH],"God bless you, Chef!"
[OTH],"And now here's your favorite band, Primus! Whoo!"
[OTH],"We're damned proud to be here to support our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who told us in the early days, to keep trying and to keep pursuing our dreams, no matter how much we sucked. I love that man."
[OTH],Whooaa..!
[OTH],What are you bastards doing?
[OTH],We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
Cartman,Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
[OTH],"Oh, yeah? We’ll just see about this!"
[OTH],"And now, here’s Joe Strummer!  Whoo!"
[OTH],"You know, when The Clash were on tour and we lost the beat, Chef would be like at the side of the stage going, ""Don't forget, pump your loins, children."" You know, that was like his motto or something."
[OTH],Whoo!
[OTH],"Well, it's a rockin' world
Make no mistake about it"
[OTH],It's a shocking world
[OTH],"Could be what's so great about it
It's a rockin' world..."
[OTH],What the hell is this?
[OTH],"Welcome to Chef Aid, Chef!"
[OTH],"Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?"
[OTH],"Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?"
[OTH],"Well, we helped."
[OTH],"We’re gonna raise your money, Chef."
[OTH],I don’t believe it!
[OTH],We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts.
[OTH],"And now, here he is TV's Ozzy Osbourne!"
[OTH],"We're all here to help our good friend, Chef, who has touched our lives in the past."
[OTH],"I remember when I was just starting out, Chef suggested I buy a pompadour hat. I thought he said, ""Bite the head off a bat"", so I did. And the rest, oh, it's just history. Now, let's go crazyyy!"
[OTH],Ain't nowhere to run!
[OTH],Ain't nowhere to hide!
[OTH],Aarrggghhh!!!
[OTH],"(All right dude, let me go now!)"
[OTH],"Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!"
[OTH],You bastard!
[OTH],And now here’s Ween!
[OTH],We're thrilled to be part of Chef Aid.
[OTH],Chef was the guy who told us to do a country album.
[OTH],"No, dude, that was Steve's idea."
[OTH],Oh. Then who's Chef?
[OTH],"I don't know, dude. I thought you knew him."
[OTH],"Oh, well. Anyways, here's our song!"
[OTH],"Many colors in the homo rainbow
Don't be afraid to let your colors shine shiiiiiiiiiiine"
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you."
[OTH],Did you love him?
[OTH],It doesn't matter. He left me.
[OTH],Did you love him?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Then run to him.
[OTH],But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision.
[OTH],"Love isn't a decision, it’s a feeling. If we could decide who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical."
[OTH],"I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you."
[OTH],"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Whoo!"
[OTH],"Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy. I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend."
[OTH],"Wake up, Wendy!"
[OTH],Smell the coffee...
[OTH],"Hey, that's your song for Wendy!"
Cartman,"Ha-ha, you're a wuss."
[OTH],"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!"
[OTH],"And what happened then? Well, in South Park they say..."
[OTH],Johnnie Cochran's heart grew three sizes that day.
[OTH],"Wait! Mr. Chef, this music has really touched me. I like to take up your case, free of charge!"
[OTH],You will?
[OTH],I will.
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer."
[OTH],Noooooooo!
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client, Chef. I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, this..."
[OTH],"...is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one minute. That does not make sense. Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line? Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!"
[OTH],"Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey."
[OTH],"Chef, how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, ""Stinky Britches""?"
[OTH],"It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children."
[OTH],"So, what are you gonna do now?"
[OTH],Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],The following program is brought to you in spooky vision. Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand.
[OTH],I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
[OTH],He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
Cartman,Hey guys. How's it going?
[OTH],"Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?"
[OTH],"Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?"
[OTH],Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?
Cartman,"You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed"
Cartman,I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
[OTH],"What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!"
[OTH],"Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve."
Cartman,"Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?"
[OTH],"Dude, this is creepy."
[OTH],Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo.
[OTH],"Hello, Stanley. Remember me?"
[OTH],"Hi, Aunt Flo."
[OTH],"Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice."
[OTH],"Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents."
[OTH],"Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!"
[OTH],"Okay, Shelly. This one's for you."
[OTH],It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theater.
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"What do you say, Shelly?"
[OTH],"Thank you, Aunt Flo."
[OTH],"Okay, Stanley. Your turn."
[OTH],Your very own fish.
[OTH],"What do you say, Stanley?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],I think he likes you. Come on Shelly. Let's hook up your home theater.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"How do you like your fish, Stanley?"
[OTH],I don't like it. It's spooky.
[OTH],"Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room."
[OTH],Do I have to?
[OTH],"Yes, you do!"
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],Language!
[OTH],"Where have you been, dude?"
[OTH],"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor."
[OTH],Aunt Flo?
[OTH],Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
[OTH],Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
[OTH],"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice."
[OTH],Here he comes.
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?"
Cartman,"Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!"
[OTH],"You said you could get us money, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!"
[OTH],"Well, at least he's back to normal."
[OTH],"Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!"
[OTH],It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
Cartman,"Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!"
[OTH],"Why do you keep saying ""hella"", fatass?!"
Cartman,"'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why."
[OTH],That's not cool!
Cartman,You guys are just hella jealous.
[OTH],"Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning."
[OTH],"Can you leave the light on, Dad?"
[OTH],"Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity."
[OTH],I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
[OTH],"Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. ."
[OTH],Where did it go? Huhhh.
[OTH],(Give me that-!)
[OTH],Kenny
[OTH],"(Ow, mom!)"
[OTH],You share that blanket with your brother!
[OTH],Who the hell could that be? .
Cartman,"Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions. There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. ."
[OTH],"Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?"
[OTH],(Uh huh.)
[OTH],Hey. Where did the shirt go? I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! AAAaAaAaAa I'm not gonna look. It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. GAAAH! AAAAAAAH!! MOM! Mom!
[OTH],"Stanley, settle down!"
[OTH],"Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!"
[OTH],Is there a problem?
[OTH],"Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo."
[OTH],Do you not like your goldfish?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt.
[OTH],"There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish."
[OTH],AAAAAAAAH!
[OTH],"Stanley, what are you doing?!"
[OTH],The fish! But-
[OTH],"Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up. Go to sleep, Stanley!"
[OTH],WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
[OTH],"All right, Stanley. I have had enough o- Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done??"
[OTH],"Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-"
[OTH],"Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel. Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body. Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy."
[OTH],You're not gonna get away with this!
[OTH],Sharon!
[OTH],"D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!"
[OTH],"Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve."
[OTH],"Mom, what are you doing?"
[OTH],"Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley."
[OTH],"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!"
[OTH],"Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything."
[OTH],But MOM!
[OTH],"Sshh.

Hush little baby, don't say a word.
Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' bird.
If that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard"
[OTH],MMOOMM!
[OTH],"What is it, honey? My baby's killed again!"
[OTH],"No, mom!"
[OTH],"What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do?? I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy."
[OTH],"It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?"
[OTH],(Uh huh!)
Cartman,"Well, where is it? What the hell is that?!"
[OTH],(It's the only thing I could afford.)
Cartman,"It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squash-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!"
[OTH],"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman! How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good."
[OTH],I haven't been sleeping so well.
Cartman,"God, I hate you, Kenny. I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull!"
[OTH],"God, will you shut up?!"
[OTH],"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Do you think animals can be murderers, too?"
[OTH],"I don't know. Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again."
Cartman,"No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?


You guys are my best friends
Through thick and thin, we've always been together
We're four of a kind, havin' fun all day
Pallin' around and laughin' away
Just best friends, best friends are we.

 I love you guys."
[OTH],"You seem tired, Stan."
[OTH],I haven't been sleeping well.
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
[OTH],"Hoh, that sucks, dude."
Cartman,"Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here."
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,"Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!"
[OTH],What are you doing?!
Cartman,"What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys."
[OTH],"You can't be standing there, Cartman."
Cartman,Why the hell not?!
[OTH],Because you're standing over there!
Cartman,Aaah! Son of a bitch!
Cartman,"Wow, you don't see this every day."
Cartman,I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Cartman,It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
Cartman,"Dude, this is hella weird."
[OTH],"Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woo, wh-what a surprise. What can I do for you?"
[OTH],"Well, there's been a report of a few missing people."
[OTH],Is that so?
[OTH],"Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them."
[OTH],"I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],"No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?"
[OTH],Why would you wanna do that?
[OTH],"Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I? Well, this all looks in- oh? Tennis anyone?"
[OTH],Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
[OTH],"Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions."
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],"All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries."
[OTH],"Uh, Chef?"
[OTH],Or haaauuunted hash browns.
[OTH],Chef.
[OTH],"And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!"
[OTH],Chef.
[OTH],And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],We have problems!
[OTH],"Well, what's the first problem?"
[OTH],"Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem? Oh, nohoho. Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!"
Cartman,"...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!"
Cartman,"I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too."
[OTH],Exactly what do you remember?
Cartman,"Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car."
[OTH],Of course! That's it!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!"
Cartman,He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
[OTH],Will you stop saying that word?!
[OTH],"Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!"
[OTH],"Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!"
Cartman,"This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef."
[OTH],How do you mean?
Cartman,"In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman."
[OTH],"Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo."
[OTH],Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
[OTH],"Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease."
Cartman,"Ey, sweet! Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,"Dude, this is hella cool."
[OTH],"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?"
[OTH],"Nn-oh. I got it from the pet store, Stanley."
[OTH],Do you remember what pet store?
[OTH],"Let's see. I believe it was called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store,"" just outside of town."
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],I know I have the address written down somewhere. Let me look.
[OTH],"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store."
Cartman,"Who's ""we""? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!"
Cartman,"I'll help you, Stan."
Cartman,"Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!"
[OTH],Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
[OTH],"Just help me take it back. Come on! Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!"
[OTH],"Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo!"
[OTH],It was the fish!
[OTH],"Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have."
[OTH],Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
[OTH],"There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude."
[OTH],Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver.
[OTH],"Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book."
Cartman,Can do!
Cartman,Screw you!
[OTH],"It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh! I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy!"
[OTH],"Come on, we're running out of time."
[OTH],"Hey, why is the basement door locked?"
[OTH],"-crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care"
Cartman,"I don't see any pet stores called ""Indian Burial Ground."""
Cartman,"Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!"
[OTH],"And now, back to the Terrance and Phillip Halloween Special."
[OTH],(Fart)
[OTH],"That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance."
Cartman,"Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny!"
Cartman,What's so funny about that?
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!"
Cartman,"Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah."
Cartman,"NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!! Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude."
[OTH],Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
[OTH],"You saw him, didn't you? You saw my boy."
[OTH],"Yeah, my goldfish-."
[OTH],"Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over."
[OTH],"My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was."
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],You've gotta tell me what happened to him! You have to know something!
[OTH],"Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!"
[OTH],"That's right, I'm a little drunk. You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy. My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh."
Cartman,"You guys, I found the pet store!"
[OTH],"Come on, let's go! Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!"
[OTH],"I believe you, sweetheart. Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!"
[OTH],Can I help you boys?
[OTH],I wanna return a fish.
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it? Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude."
[OTH],Damn it! Just like all the other returns!
[OTH],"Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"""
[OTH],"Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it."
[OTH],So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
[OTH],"Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
[OTH],"We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe."
[OTH],"Well, that certainly would explain a lot."
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],"Well, like this. I've been wondering what the hell this was."
[OTH],"Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you. Okay, bye, then."
[OTH],Sharon?
[OTH],"Yes, hon?"
[OTH],There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
[OTH],"Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away."
[OTH],"Why'd you take his pants off? Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?"
[OTH],"Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore."
[OTH],What is it?
[OTH],"I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again."
[OTH],"Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?"
[OTH],"Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish."
[OTH],I can't give you your money back.
[OTH],"I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!"
[OTH],No! I won't take it back!
Cartman,"Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, ""Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe."" Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly , you're gonna take this fish back."
[OTH],"All right, you win."
[OTH],"Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman!"
Cartman,"And sir, can I make a suggestion? Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace."
[OTH],"You kick ass, evil Cartman!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him!"
Cartman,"No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer."
[OTH],What the-?
[OTH],He was here! Cartman was just here!
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?
[OTH],I don't know who you mean?
[OTH],Maybe this will jog your memory!
[OTH],No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
[OTH],I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
Cartman,"Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest."
[OTH],"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot."
Cartman,Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
[OTH],"You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman."
[OTH],"Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella."""
Cartman,"Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe."
[OTH],"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?"
Cartman,Let's use Kenny's squash.
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care."
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],Aaaaagh!
Cartman,"Aw, man, this movie is hella scary."
[OTH],"Aha! There you are, Cartman!"
Cartman,"P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?"
[OTH],"We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!"
Cartman,Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
[OTH],"Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman?"
Cartman,What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum. I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
[OTH],"Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe!"
Cartman,Don't touch me!
[OTH],What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us!
[OTH],"Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!"
Cartman,"Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!"
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,"Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you."
[OTH],"And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! ""The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"""
[OTH],"We won, dude!"
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball!
Cartman,"Oh, no! Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back!"
[OTH],"Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us!"
Cartman,"Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!"
[OTH],"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!"
[OTH],"Thought you could get away from us, huh, Cartman?!"
Cartman,Please!
[OTH],"Leave him alone, butthole!"
[OTH],"Shut your trap, kid!"
[OTH],Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
Cartman,"Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!"
[OTH],"It's time, Cartman! Prepare for gingerification!"
Cartman,"Well, good-bye, you guys. It's been fun."
[OTH],"Oh, what now?!"
[OTH],It's the evil pets
[OTH],The gingerification gun!
[OTH],Get to the stage!
[OTH],"Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!"
[OTH],"Give me that gun, kid!"
[OTH],"Up yours, evil twin!"
[OTH],Noooooo!
[OTH],Noooooo!
Cartman,"All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!"
[OTH],Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya.
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe!"
[OTH],Which one is the good Cartman?
Cartman,I am!
[OTH],"Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!"
[OTH],"Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!"
Cartman,He is!
Cartman,Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both.
Cartman,What?!
Cartman,"It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world."
Cartman,Noooo! Screw you guys!
Cartman,How did you guys know?
[OTH],Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
Cartman,Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
[OTH],"Oh no, dude!"
[OTH],"You tricked us, Cartman!"
Cartman,"That's right, I did!

You guys are hella stupid
You guys are hella lame
You guys are hella dumb
Hella hella hella!"
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],"I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore."
[OTH],"Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor."
[OTH],"Uuuh, do you want your pants back?"
[OTH],"No. Just leave me with my dignity. Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here."
[OTH],The following program is brought to you in spooky vision. Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand.
[OTH],I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
[OTH],He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
Cartman,Hey guys. How's it going?
[OTH],"Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?"
[OTH],"Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?"
[OTH],Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?
Cartman,"You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed"
Cartman,I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
[OTH],"What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!"
[OTH],"Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve."
Cartman,"Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?"
[OTH],"Dude, this is creepy."
[OTH],Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo.
[OTH],"Hello, Stanley. Remember me?"
[OTH],"Hi, Aunt Flo."
[OTH],"Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice."
[OTH],"Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents."
[OTH],"Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!"
[OTH],"Okay, Shelly. This one's for you."
[OTH],It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theater.
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"What do you say, Shelly?"
[OTH],"Thank you, Aunt Flo."
[OTH],"Okay, Stanley. Your turn."
[OTH],Your very own fish.
[OTH],"What do you say, Stanley?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],I think he likes you. Come on Shelly. Let's hook up your home theater.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"How do you like your fish, Stanley?"
[OTH],I don't like it. It's spooky.
[OTH],"Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room."
[OTH],Do I have to?
[OTH],"Yes, you do!"
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],Language!
[OTH],"Where have you been, dude?"
[OTH],"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor."
[OTH],Aunt Flo?
[OTH],Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
[OTH],Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
[OTH],"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice."
[OTH],Here he comes.
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?"
Cartman,"Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!"
[OTH],"You said you could get us money, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!"
[OTH],"Well, at least he's back to normal."
[OTH],"Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!"
[OTH],It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
Cartman,"Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!"
[OTH],"Why do you keep saying ""hella"", fatass?!"
Cartman,"'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why."
[OTH],That's not cool!
Cartman,You guys are just hella jealous.
[OTH],"Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning."
[OTH],"Can you leave the light on, Dad?"
[OTH],"Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity."
[OTH],I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
[OTH],"Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. ."
[OTH],Where did it go? Huhhh.
[OTH],(Give me that-!)
[OTH],Kenny
[OTH],"(Ow, mom!)"
[OTH],You share that blanket with your brother!
[OTH],Who the hell could that be? .
Cartman,"Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions. There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. ."
[OTH],"Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?"
[OTH],(Uh huh.)
[OTH],Hey. Where did the shirt go? I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! AAAaAaAaAa I'm not gonna look. It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. GAAAH! AAAAAAAH!! MOM! Mom!
[OTH],"Stanley, settle down!"
[OTH],"Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!"
[OTH],Is there a problem?
[OTH],"Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo."
[OTH],Do you not like your goldfish?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt.
[OTH],"There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish."
[OTH],AAAAAAAAH!
[OTH],"Stanley, what are you doing?!"
[OTH],The fish! But-
[OTH],"Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up. Go to sleep, Stanley!"
[OTH],WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
[OTH],"All right, Stanley. I have had enough o- Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done??"
[OTH],"Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-"
[OTH],"Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel. Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body. Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy."
[OTH],You're not gonna get away with this!
[OTH],Sharon!
[OTH],"D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!"
[OTH],"Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve."
[OTH],"Mom, what are you doing?"
[OTH],"Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley."
[OTH],"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!"
[OTH],"Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything."
[OTH],But MOM!
[OTH],"Sshh.

Hush little baby, don't say a word.
Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' bird.
If that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard"
[OTH],MMOOMM!
[OTH],"What is it, honey? My baby's killed again!"
[OTH],"No, mom!"
[OTH],"What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do?? I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy."
[OTH],"It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?"
[OTH],(Uh huh!)
Cartman,"Well, where is it? What the hell is that?!"
[OTH],(It's the only thing I could afford.)
Cartman,"It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squash-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!"
[OTH],"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman! How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good."
[OTH],I haven't been sleeping so well.
Cartman,"God, I hate you, Kenny. I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull!"
[OTH],"God, will you shut up?!"
[OTH],"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Do you think animals can be murderers, too?"
[OTH],"I don't know. Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again."
Cartman,"No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?


You guys are my best friends
Through thick and thin, we've always been together
We're four of a kind, havin' fun all day
Pallin' around and laughin' away
Just best friends, best friends are we.

 I love you guys."
[OTH],"You seem tired, Stan."
[OTH],I haven't been sleeping well.
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
[OTH],"Hoh, that sucks, dude."
Cartman,"Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here."
[OTH],Cartman?
Cartman,"Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!"
[OTH],What are you doing?!
Cartman,"What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys."
[OTH],"You can't be standing there, Cartman."
Cartman,Why the hell not?!
[OTH],Because you're standing over there!
Cartman,Aaah! Son of a bitch!
Cartman,"Wow, you don't see this every day."
Cartman,I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Cartman,It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
Cartman,"Dude, this is hella weird."
[OTH],"Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woo, wh-what a surprise. What can I do for you?"
[OTH],"Well, there's been a report of a few missing people."
[OTH],Is that so?
[OTH],"Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them."
[OTH],"I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],"No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?"
[OTH],Why would you wanna do that?
[OTH],"Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I? Well, this all looks in- oh? Tennis anyone?"
[OTH],Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
[OTH],"Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions."
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],"All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries."
[OTH],"Uh, Chef?"
[OTH],Or haaauuunted hash browns.
[OTH],Chef.
[OTH],"And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!"
[OTH],Chef.
[OTH],And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],We have problems!
[OTH],"Well, what's the first problem?"
[OTH],"Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem? Oh, nohoho. Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!"
Cartman,"...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!"
Cartman,"I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too."
[OTH],Exactly what do you remember?
Cartman,"Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car."
[OTH],Of course! That's it!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!"
Cartman,He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
[OTH],Will you stop saying that word?!
[OTH],"Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!"
[OTH],"Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!"
Cartman,"This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef."
[OTH],How do you mean?
Cartman,"In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman."
[OTH],"Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo."
[OTH],Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
[OTH],"Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease."
Cartman,"Ey, sweet! Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,"Dude, this is hella cool."
[OTH],"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?"
[OTH],"Nn-oh. I got it from the pet store, Stanley."
[OTH],Do you remember what pet store?
[OTH],"Let's see. I believe it was called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store,"" just outside of town."
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],I know I have the address written down somewhere. Let me look.
[OTH],"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store."
Cartman,"Who's ""we""? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!"
Cartman,"I'll help you, Stan."
Cartman,"Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!"
[OTH],Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
[OTH],"Just help me take it back. Come on! Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!"
[OTH],"Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo!"
[OTH],It was the fish!
[OTH],"Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have."
[OTH],Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
[OTH],"There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude."
[OTH],Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver.
[OTH],"Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book."
Cartman,Can do!
Cartman,Screw you!
[OTH],"It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh! I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy!"
[OTH],"Come on, we're running out of time."
[OTH],"Hey, why is the basement door locked?"
[OTH],"-crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care"
Cartman,"I don't see any pet stores called ""Indian Burial Ground."""
Cartman,"Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!"
[OTH],"And now, back to the Terrance and Phillip Halloween Special."
[OTH],(Fart)
[OTH],"That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance."
Cartman,"Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny!"
Cartman,What's so funny about that?
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!"
Cartman,"Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah."
Cartman,"NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!! Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude."
[OTH],Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
[OTH],"You saw him, didn't you? You saw my boy."
[OTH],"Yeah, my goldfish-."
[OTH],"Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over."
[OTH],"My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was."
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],You've gotta tell me what happened to him! You have to know something!
[OTH],"Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!"
[OTH],"That's right, I'm a little drunk. You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy. My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh."
Cartman,"You guys, I found the pet store!"
[OTH],"Come on, let's go! Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!"
[OTH],"I believe you, sweetheart. Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!"
[OTH],Can I help you boys?
[OTH],I wanna return a fish.
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it? Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude."
[OTH],Damn it! Just like all the other returns!
[OTH],"Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"""
[OTH],"Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it."
[OTH],So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
[OTH],"Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
[OTH],"We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe."
[OTH],"Well, that certainly would explain a lot."
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],"Well, like this. I've been wondering what the hell this was."
[OTH],"Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you. Okay, bye, then."
[OTH],Sharon?
[OTH],"Yes, hon?"
[OTH],There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
[OTH],"Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away."
[OTH],"Why'd you take his pants off? Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?"
[OTH],"Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore."
[OTH],What is it?
[OTH],"I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again."
[OTH],"Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?"
[OTH],"Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish."
[OTH],I can't give you your money back.
[OTH],"I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!"
[OTH],No! I won't take it back!
Cartman,"Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, ""Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe."" Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly , you're gonna take this fish back."
[OTH],"All right, you win."
[OTH],"Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman!"
Cartman,"And sir, can I make a suggestion? Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace."
[OTH],"You kick ass, evil Cartman!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him!"
Cartman,"No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer."
[OTH],What the-?
[OTH],He was here! Cartman was just here!
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?
[OTH],I don't know who you mean?
[OTH],Maybe this will jog your memory!
[OTH],No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
[OTH],I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
Cartman,"Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest."
[OTH],"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot."
Cartman,Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
[OTH],"You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman."
[OTH],"Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella."""
Cartman,"Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe."
[OTH],"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?"
Cartman,Let's use Kenny's squash.
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care."
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],Aaaaagh!
Cartman,"Aw, man, this movie is hella scary."
[OTH],"Aha! There you are, Cartman!"
Cartman,"P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?"
[OTH],"We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!"
Cartman,Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
[OTH],"Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman?"
Cartman,What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum. I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
[OTH],"Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe!"
Cartman,Don't touch me!
[OTH],What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us!
[OTH],"Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!"
Cartman,"Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!"
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,"Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you."
[OTH],"And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! ""The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"""
[OTH],"We won, dude!"
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball!
Cartman,"Oh, no! Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back!"
[OTH],"Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us!"
Cartman,"Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!"
[OTH],"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!"
[OTH],"Thought you could get away from us, huh, Cartman?!"
Cartman,Please!
[OTH],"Leave him alone, butthole!"
[OTH],"Shut your trap, kid!"
[OTH],Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
Cartman,"Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!"
[OTH],"It's time, Cartman! Prepare for gingerification!"
Cartman,"Well, good-bye, you guys. It's been fun."
[OTH],"Oh, what now?!"
[OTH],It's the evil pets
[OTH],The gingerification gun!
[OTH],Get to the stage!
[OTH],"Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!"
[OTH],"Give me that gun, kid!"
[OTH],"Up yours, evil twin!"
[OTH],Noooooo!
[OTH],Noooooo!
Cartman,"All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!"
[OTH],Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya.
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe!"
[OTH],Which one is the good Cartman?
Cartman,I am!
[OTH],"Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!"
[OTH],"Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!"
Cartman,He is!
Cartman,Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both.
Cartman,What?!
Cartman,"It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world."
Cartman,Noooo! Screw you guys!
Cartman,How did you guys know?
[OTH],Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
Cartman,Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
[OTH],"Oh no, dude!"
[OTH],"You tricked us, Cartman!"
Cartman,"That's right, I did!

You guys are hella stupid
You guys are hella lame
You guys are hella dumb
Hella hella hella!"
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],"I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore."
[OTH],"Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor."
[OTH],"Uuuh, do you want your pants back?"
[OTH],"No. Just leave me with my dignity. Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here."
[OTH],"The answer is ""no"", Stanley!"
[OTH],"But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays."
[OTH],But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
[OTH],I'll leave it up to your father.
[OTH],"Eh, it's fine with me."
[OTH],"The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!"
[OTH],I don't want your lame-ass supper!
[OTH],Ew! You're gonna get it now.
[OTH],"Go to your room, Stanley! Right now!"
[OTH],Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old! I don't need this stupid family anyway!
[OTH],It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
[OTH],"Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends."
Cartman,"Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a big present, for no reason, except that I'm cool."
[OTH],"That's nice, Cartman."
[OTH],"Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?"
[OTH],(Okay.)
[OTH],"Okay, let's go!"
Cartman,"Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan."
[OTH],"'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!"
[OTH],"Goodbye, bubbe! Be careful!"
[OTH],"See you in a couple of days, son."
Cartman,"Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun! Kenny, I called it shotgun! Dammit, Kenny, get in the back! Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there. Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade! Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! , Go get it! ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap."
[OTH],"So, how far is it to Nebraska?"
[OTH],Around six hours.
[OTH],Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
[OTH],"Well, I've got an idea. We could sing."
[OTH],"Yeah. Or, we could not."
Cartman,"Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?"
[OTH],Over the meadow and through the woods
Cartman,"To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow..."
Cartman,"Over the meadow and through the woods
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh"
[OTH],Please stop.
Cartman,Through white and drifted snow
[OTH],Please stop!
Cartman,"Over the meadow and through the woods,
To Grandmother's house we go"
Cartman,Argh!
[OTH],"Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy."
Cartman,"I guess, damn!"
[OTH],"Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska."
[OTH],This is Nebraska?
[OTH],What's all that stuff?
[OTH],"Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--"
Cartman,"We don't care, Mom."
[OTH],"Hey, look! See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!"
[OTH],"Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?"
[OTH],"I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous."
Cartman,"Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap."
[OTH],It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
[OTH],That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
[OTH],Cool!
Cartman,How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
[OTH],"About another hour, hon."
Cartman,Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
[OTH],"Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's."
Cartman,Over the meadow and through the woods
Cartman,To Grandmother's house we go
[OTH],"Oh, God!"
Cartman,"The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow..."
Cartman,Over the meadow and through the woods...
[OTH],Here we are.
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, finally!"
Cartman,Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma!
[OTH],"Oh, it's little Eric!"
Cartman,"Hi, Grandpa!"
[OTH],Look at how big you've gotten!
[OTH],"Hi, Eric. Grandma got you a present."
Cartman,Sweet. What is it?
[OTH],It's inside.
Cartman,Yes! Move it!
[OTH],Hello everyone. Happy Holidays!
[OTH],Hello!
[OTH],"These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky."
[OTH],Nice to have you heuh.
[OTH],"Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence."
[OTH],"Come here, Eric. Give your great-grandma some huggies."
[OTH],Agghh!
[OTH],"No, no, Florence, that's not Eric."
[OTH],"Oh, which one is he, then?"
[OTH],He's the fat one.
[OTH],"He's not fat, he's big-boned."
Cartman,"I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech."
[OTH],That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
[OTH],"Sick, dude."
Cartman,"Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?"
[OTH],"Here you go, Eric. Hap-py Holidays!"
Cartman,"Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt!"
[OTH],Yes. I thought that would look really good on you.
Cartman,"Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!"
[OTH],"Well, this is what the holidays are about. Family."
[OTH],"Yeah, right!"
[OTH],"Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan?"
[OTH],My family's dead!
[OTH],"Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley."
[OTH],"Dude, your family died?"
[OTH],They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,I can't believe I got a stupid shirt! The holidays are bullcrap!
[OTH],"Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner?"
[OTH],What is this??
[OTH],Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
[OTH],"Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?"
Cartman,"Hi, cousin Elvin."
[OTH],Sweet.
[OTH],"Well, it certainly is nice we could all gather heuh for the holidays. Even Uncle Howard has joined us live via satellite from the state penitentiary."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"You look good, Howard."
[OTH],No I don't!
[OTH],"Hi, Howard."
[OTH],"Dude, is he here every year like this?"
Cartman,Yup!
[OTH],Sweet.
[OTH],Aaww!
[OTH],"Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!"
[OTH],"Where's your manners, Howard? We haven't even said grace yet. Mom, will you do the honors of saying grace?"
[OTH],"God-damn it, why the hell do I always have to say grace? If one more person asks me to say grace, I'll be like, ""Eh! I'm not saying grace! And if you ask me again, I'll kick you square in the nuts!"""
Cartman,Amen.
[OTH],Ah-men.
[OTH],"Jesus, dude!"
[OTH],"No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie! No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!"
Cartman,Bad Jimmy!
[OTH],"No, Jimmy, that's Grandpa's pot pie!"
[OTH],"Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here."
[OTH],I know what you mean.
[OTH],Arrggh!
[OTH],"What, dude?"
[OTH],"Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!"
[OTH],"Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans."
[OTH],Oh. Arrggh!
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],"I heard it, too."
Cartman,"Whatever it is, it's getting closer. Ow! What the hell was that for!"
[OTH],I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming.
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"I wanted to make sure, too."
Cartman,"Yuhwell, you're not dreaming! Ey! Cut the crap!"
[OTH],"Dude, it's coming through the window!"
Cartman,Uncle Howard!
[OTH],"Oh. Hey, Eric. I didn't think anybody'd be down here."
Cartman,"Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!"
[OTH],We thought you were in jail.
[OTH],"Yeah, well I'b I busted out."
Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here.
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids."
Cartman,Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
[OTH],"Come on up, it's okay. Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy."
[OTH],"Oh, hi boys. I'm Charlie. Charlie Manson."
[OTH],I can't wait to get out among the pigs and raise some hell.
[OTH],"All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while."
[OTH],"When I stand up on the mountain and say, ""Do it!"", it gets done! And it it don't get done, then I'll move on it! And that's the last thing in the world you want me to do."
[OTH],"All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something."
[OTH],"Now back to, ""It's A Wonderful Life""."
[OTH],"You-oo you just can't buy people, Mr. Potter, wuh. Why, you know what you are? You're a little bitch. That's right, you're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?"
[OTH],"Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman."
Cartman,"All right, keeps your pants on."
[OTH],"Hey, bring us down some food, all right?"
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"Come on, Team!"
Cartman,Can somebody drive us to the mall?
[OTH],Touchdown!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?"
[OTH],And these Cornhuskers have the ball on the 50-yard line!
Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?"
[OTH],"Not now, Eric. Hold him! He has him! Where's the flag?!"
Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!"
[OTH],"I said ""no,"" and I mean ""no!"" Respect my authorituh!"
Cartman,Damn his Goddamned authorituh!
[OTH],"With only 16 seconds left, the Cornhu-"
[OTH],We interrupt this broadcast for a news bulletin.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Mass murderer and extremely nasty person Charles Manson has escaped from prison! Manson was the man responsible for seven murders in the late '60's. Manson has never shown any signs of remorse for his crimes. If you see Manson, please kick his ass and smash his fucking face in for me, and then call the police. And now back to the game."
[OTH],And they've done it! They've scored 16 unanswered points in 15 seconds!
[OTH],"Oh, weak!"
[OTH],"Eric, I need you to take care of your cousin Elvin for a while."
Cartman,I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
[OTH],Won't yo do it for Grandma?
Cartman,All right. Give me $10.
[OTH],Kick ass!
[OTH],"Oh, Mary. Mary, you're real!"
[OTH],"Chuck, can you turn that thing down?"
[OTH],"Hello, movie house! Hello, burger parlor!"
[OTH],"You know what the spirit of Christmas is? It's another lie, from the lyin' pigs that consider me the witness-!"
[OTH],"Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much!"
Cartman,My family sucks ass!
[OTH],"Yeah, they do!"
[OTH],All families suck ass!
Cartman,Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns.
[OTH],"Wow, sweet!"
[OTH],Heyyy!
[OTH],"Dude, we have to get to the mall!!"
[OTH],"You guys, seriously!"
[OTH],What's the matter?
Cartman,"My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us."
[OTH],"Oh, bummer."
[OTH],I'll take you!
[OTH],"Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials."
[OTH],"Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up in somebody's basement! I want some action!"
[OTH],"Good for you, Charlie!"
[OTH],Come on! I'll hot-wire your Grandpa's car!
[OTH],Do you really think we should go with this guy?
Cartman,"Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people."
[OTH],"All right, boys, keep your heads down! We're goin' to the mall!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],I just can't believe he would go without our permission!
[OTH],"Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something."
[OTH],"Well, I hope for his sake you're right."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?"
[OTH],"Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon."
[OTH],Wwhat?!
[OTH],Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.
[OTH],"Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!"
[OTH],"Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!"
[OTH],Do you see him?
[OTH],Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
[OTH],I can't wait to see him! He's gonna be so glad we came!
[OTH],I drove all the way from Montana to see Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],"That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous."
Cartman,How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff.
[OTH],Mr. Hankey kicks ass!
Cartman,And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
[OTH],So?!
Cartman,"So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?"
[OTH],"Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants."
[OTH],How would you like to come with me to a more secluded part of the mall?
[OTH],(Okay)
[OTH],I really like that guy.
Cartman,"Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin. God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin! No, Elvin, bad Elvin!"
[OTH],"Folks need to understand that I am terror! I am fear! I am-! Oh, hey look, another holiday special."
[OTH],"And now, back to ""The Grinchy Poo"""
[OTH],"Grinchy Poo went up the chimney and stuffed the tree up
But then he heard a coo, like the cry of a dove
It was little Cindy Lou Poo, who was no more than two
""Mr. Hankey, why? Why are you taking our Christmas tree, why?""
And Old Grinchy Poo thought of a line, and he thought it up quick..."
[OTH],"All right, boys, you're up next. Welcome to Mr. Hankey's Happy Lollyland!"
[OTH],"Hoh, boy. Here we go!"
[OTH],"Howdy ho, boys."
[OTH],Mr. Hankey?
[OTH],"Gosh, you boys smell like flowers."
[OTH],You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],Sure I am! Howdy ho!
[OTH],You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
[OTH],"Well, Mr. Hankey has to grow too, you know. Howdy ho!"
[OTH],You boys want your picture with Mr. Hankey?
[OTH],This is not Mr. Hankey! This is a fake!
[OTH],"It's okay, kids. I'm real. Hoowwdy ho!"
[OTH],Hoowwdy ho!
[OTH],Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
[OTH],"Look, kid. There's Mr. Hankeys like me in every shopping mall. There is no real Mr. Hankey."
[OTH],What?! What did you say?!
[OTH],"Oh, boy. You've done it now."
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],Behold! Here's your false prophet!
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Die!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Get out!
[OTH],You son of a bitch! Rip it down! Get out!
[OTH],"You lied to me, Mother. You said it was the real Mr. Hankey."
[OTH],"Uh, well, yes, but-"
[OTH],"I will not forget this, Mother. I will not forget this, ever."
[OTH],This is revolution!
[OTH],Wah-hahow!
[OTH],"Uh oh, they're rioting again."
[OTH],"And all the poos down in Pooville joined hands and they sang
They sang all the same
And he himself, the Grinchy Poo, carved the roast poo."
[OTH],"Wow, man. That's beautiful. He was evil, but now he's good."
[OTH],What's happening?
[OTH],Some kid must have said it wasn't the real Mr. Hankey again.
Cartman,I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!
[OTH],"Well, how was it?"
[OTH],It was a fake!
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry."
[OTH],Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
[OTH],"Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?"
[OTH],"Uh, I went to a beauty parlor and had my tattoo redone. Look!"
Cartman,"Oh, uh that's pretty cool."
[OTH],Hey. Where's Kenny?
[OTH],Oh. He's... around.
[OTH],"(Hey guys, what's up?)"
[OTH],"Oh, hey Kenny."
[OTH],"Come on, I'll buy you kids an orange Smoothie."
[OTH],Ooooo!
[OTH],"Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson!"
[OTH],"Run for your lives, boys!"
Cartman,Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously.
[OTH],"Come back here, God damnit! He's getting away!"
[OTH],"Keep your heads down, kids!"
Cartman,Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
[OTH],"I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!"
[OTH],We interrupt this program for a breaking news story.
[OTH],A high speed car chase is happening right now on interstate 3. We go now to our live sky-fi helicopter.
[OTH],"Ron, it looks as though the chase is proceeding west down the interstate."
[OTH],"Oh, that looks a lot like your car, Harold."
[OTH],"We understand that Charles Manson is inside the car with several hostages, all of whom are children My God, what is this world coming to? Well, we'd like to take a moment to tell you that this car chase is being brought to you by Snacky S'mores , the creamy bonbon s'mores in a delightful cookie crunch."
[OTH],They're gaining on us!
[OTH],Fudgecicle!
[OTH],Kickass!
[OTH],"God, I hate the holiday season!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello kids. Having fun-?"
[OTH],Get in the house!
[OTH],"Alrighty, then."
Cartman,Lock the door!
[OTH],"Oh my God, it's Charlie Manson! Whoa!"
[OTH],What's going on?
[OTH],There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
[OTH],"Quiet down, we're watching television."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip, what a precious gift!"
[OTH],"That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing."
[OTH],The cops are here!
[OTH],Howard!
[OTH],"How did you get out, son?"
[OTH],"All right, Manson, we know you're in there! Come out peacefully, and we'll shoot you!"
[OTH],"Tell him we won't shoot him, Boss."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Come out peacefully, and we won't shoot you!"
[OTH],"Oh, look. Police Chief Stevens got a new haircut."
[OTH],"Get down, Ma!"
[OTH],"Hey, man, don't point a gun at your own mother!"
[OTH],"What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house!"
[OTH],"Well, Howard, you've done it again! You've ruined Christmas!"
[OTH],"This is Robert Pooner reporting live from Nebraska, where escaped convict Charlie Manson has walled himself up in a house. We understand that there are hostages, and that the situation is critical, , so we would like to remind you all that this live hostage crisis is being brought to you by Palmoral Sun Block . Remember, if it isn't Palmoral, you're gonna get cancer."
[OTH],What's going on here?!
[OTH],"We've got a critical situation, ma'am. Charlie Manson is holding everybody inside hostage."
[OTH],Is this the Cartman residence?
[OTH],"Yes, ma'am."
[OTH],Give me that! Stanley! This is your mother!
[OTH],Oh ooh.
[OTH],"What's your mom doing here, dude?"
[OTH],"Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time!"
[OTH],"Wow, she's really pissed."
[OTH],"I'm glad I'm not you right now, kid."
[OTH],"What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!"
[OTH],...Sorry.
[OTH],"Still more developments in the Manson hostage crisis. Uh, it appears now that eight-year-old Stan Marsh is in BIG, big trouble. He apparently disobeyed his parents, left home without telling them, and uh, Tom, his- his mother is very disappointed with him."
[OTH],Damn it! What are we gonna do?
[OTH],Sshhhh! We're watching television.
[OTH],Waitwaitwaitwait.
[OTH],Check out this one.
[OTH],"Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here."
[OTH],"Okay, here I come, okay."
[OTH],"Okay, waitwait waitwait."
[OTH],Come out with your hands up!
[OTH],"Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?!"
[OTH],"Well, there's that old window in the bathroom; you could probably squeeze through there."
[OTH],"That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson!"
[OTH],But I gotta see what happens.
[OTH],"Come on, damn it! Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays."
[OTH],Happy holidays.
[OTH],"Dude, they're gonna kill me."
[OTH],"All right, Manson, this is it! We're coming in after you! There's gonna be a lot of bloodshed, and a lot of innocent people are gonna die! You've got until 100-Marshmallow to come out!"
[OTH],"1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,..."
[OTH],"All right, it's open! Let's go!"
[OTH],'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
[OTH],Huh?!
[OTH],"Please, I don't wanna go back with them."
[OTH],"But Stan, your mother and father are out there!"
[OTH],I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
[OTH],"All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go."
[OTH],"Stan, I wanna talk to you about family."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did."
[OTH],"But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me."
[OTH],"If they don't care about you, would they have driven nine hours to Nebraska?"
[OTH],"I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks."
[OTH],Now can we go??
[OTH],"No, Howard. You go ahead. I've got something to say."
[OTH],"Oh, weak!"
[OTH],"Folks, I apologize for this whole mess. I'm going to surrender. Somebody show the police a white flag."
[OTH],"90-Marshmallow, 91-Marshmallow This is making me hungry for marshmallows 92-Marshmallow"
[OTH],"Look out, he's got a white flag!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed the little orange-coat kid!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],They're surrendering!
[OTH],"Okay, grab a hold of him. You're under arrest, buddy."
[OTH],"All right you, spread 'em!"
[OTH],"You're going back to prison to rot, Manson!"
[OTH],Good! I deserve to!
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"I can never make it up to the families that I destroyed, but at least I'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime is an answer."
[OTH],Stop that.
[OTH],"You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about!"
[OTH],Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
[OTH],"I've been such a bastard all these years, and I finally understand. And it it it feels great! If I feel like- I feel like I'm in my own Christmas special. You see...
Holidays are that special time
When we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozy
Forget about being angry for a day Remember how it felt to be a child
Opening presents on Christmas mornin' 
That's the way that we should all feel now
So I say Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy
Holidays"
[OTH],Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happyHolidays
[OTH],"Happy Kwanzaa, too
From me to you
Happy Holidays, you guys."
[OTH],"Happy Holidays, Bob."
[OTH],"Happy Holidays, Chief."
[OTH],"Come on, Manson. You belong in jail."
[OTH],You're darn right I do.
[OTH],"Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me."
[OTH],"Oh, of course we forgive you, son. It was nice of you to pop in for the holidays."
[OTH],"Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son."
[OTH],"I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help."
Cartman,"See ya, Uncle Howard. Thanks for being such a great role model for me. Piece of crap."
[OTH],"I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom."
[OTH],"Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
[OTH],"Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?"
[OTH],"And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, everyone."
[OTH],"""And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season."" What do you think, guys?"
[OTH],"It sucks, just like all your other books."
[OTH],"Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy Holidays."
[OTH],Shut up!
[OTH],What was that? What the?!
Cartman,"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson! ""Hark,"" the herald angels sin,
""Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled"" Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
""Hark,"" the herald angels sing"
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"The answer is ""no"", Stanley!"
[OTH],"But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays."
[OTH],But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
[OTH],I'll leave it up to your father.
[OTH],"Eh, it's fine with me."
[OTH],"The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!"
[OTH],I don't want your lame-ass supper!
[OTH],Ew! You're gonna get it now.
[OTH],"Go to your room, Stanley! Right now!"
[OTH],Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old! I don't need this stupid family anyway!
[OTH],It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
[OTH],"Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends."
Cartman,"Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a big present, for no reason, except that I'm cool."
[OTH],"That's nice, Cartman."
[OTH],"Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?"
[OTH],(Okay.)
[OTH],"Okay, let's go!"
Cartman,"Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan."
[OTH],"'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!"
[OTH],"Goodbye, bubbe! Be careful!"
[OTH],"See you in a couple of days, son."
Cartman,"Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun! Kenny, I called it shotgun! Dammit, Kenny, get in the back! Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there. Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade! Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! , Go get it! ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap."
[OTH],"So, how far is it to Nebraska?"
[OTH],Around six hours.
[OTH],Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
[OTH],"Well, I've got an idea. We could sing."
[OTH],"Yeah. Or, we could not."
Cartman,"Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?"
[OTH],Over the meadow and through the woods
Cartman,"To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow..."
Cartman,"Over the meadow and through the woods
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh"
[OTH],Please stop.
Cartman,Through white and drifted snow
[OTH],Please stop!
Cartman,"Over the meadow and through the woods,
To Grandmother's house we go"
Cartman,Argh!
[OTH],"Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy."
Cartman,"I guess, damn!"
[OTH],"Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska."
[OTH],This is Nebraska?
[OTH],What's all that stuff?
[OTH],"Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--"
Cartman,"We don't care, Mom."
[OTH],"Hey, look! See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!"
[OTH],"Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?"
[OTH],"I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous."
Cartman,"Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap."
[OTH],It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
[OTH],That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
[OTH],Cool!
Cartman,How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
[OTH],"About another hour, hon."
Cartman,Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
[OTH],"Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's."
Cartman,Over the meadow and through the woods
Cartman,To Grandmother's house we go
[OTH],"Oh, God!"
Cartman,"The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow..."
Cartman,Over the meadow and through the woods...
[OTH],Here we are.
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, finally!"
Cartman,Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma!
[OTH],"Oh, it's little Eric!"
Cartman,"Hi, Grandpa!"
[OTH],Look at how big you've gotten!
[OTH],"Hi, Eric. Grandma got you a present."
Cartman,Sweet. What is it?
[OTH],It's inside.
Cartman,Yes! Move it!
[OTH],Hello everyone. Happy Holidays!
[OTH],Hello!
[OTH],"These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky."
[OTH],Nice to have you heuh.
[OTH],"Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence."
[OTH],"Come here, Eric. Give your great-grandma some huggies."
[OTH],Agghh!
[OTH],"No, no, Florence, that's not Eric."
[OTH],"Oh, which one is he, then?"
[OTH],He's the fat one.
[OTH],"He's not fat, he's big-boned."
Cartman,"I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech."
[OTH],That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
[OTH],"Sick, dude."
Cartman,"Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?"
[OTH],"Here you go, Eric. Hap-py Holidays!"
Cartman,"Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt!"
[OTH],Yes. I thought that would look really good on you.
Cartman,"Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!"
[OTH],"Well, this is what the holidays are about. Family."
[OTH],"Yeah, right!"
[OTH],"Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan?"
[OTH],My family's dead!
[OTH],"Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley."
[OTH],"Dude, your family died?"
[OTH],They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,I can't believe I got a stupid shirt! The holidays are bullcrap!
[OTH],"Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner?"
[OTH],What is this??
[OTH],Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
[OTH],"Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?"
Cartman,"Hi, cousin Elvin."
[OTH],Sweet.
[OTH],"Well, it certainly is nice we could all gather heuh for the holidays. Even Uncle Howard has joined us live via satellite from the state penitentiary."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"You look good, Howard."
[OTH],No I don't!
[OTH],"Hi, Howard."
[OTH],"Dude, is he here every year like this?"
Cartman,Yup!
[OTH],Sweet.
[OTH],Aaww!
[OTH],"Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!"
[OTH],"Where's your manners, Howard? We haven't even said grace yet. Mom, will you do the honors of saying grace?"
[OTH],"God-damn it, why the hell do I always have to say grace? If one more person asks me to say grace, I'll be like, ""Eh! I'm not saying grace! And if you ask me again, I'll kick you square in the nuts!"""
Cartman,Amen.
[OTH],Ah-men.
[OTH],"Jesus, dude!"
[OTH],"No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie! No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!"
Cartman,Bad Jimmy!
[OTH],"No, Jimmy, that's Grandpa's pot pie!"
[OTH],"Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here."
[OTH],I know what you mean.
[OTH],Arrggh!
[OTH],"What, dude?"
[OTH],"Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!"
[OTH],"Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans."
[OTH],Oh. Arrggh!
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],"I heard it, too."
Cartman,"Whatever it is, it's getting closer. Ow! What the hell was that for!"
[OTH],I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming.
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"I wanted to make sure, too."
Cartman,"Yuhwell, you're not dreaming! Ey! Cut the crap!"
[OTH],"Dude, it's coming through the window!"
Cartman,Uncle Howard!
[OTH],"Oh. Hey, Eric. I didn't think anybody'd be down here."
Cartman,"Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!"
[OTH],We thought you were in jail.
[OTH],"Yeah, well I'b I busted out."
Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here.
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids."
Cartman,Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
[OTH],"Come on up, it's okay. Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy."
[OTH],"Oh, hi boys. I'm Charlie. Charlie Manson."
[OTH],I can't wait to get out among the pigs and raise some hell.
[OTH],"All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while."
[OTH],"When I stand up on the mountain and say, ""Do it!"", it gets done! And it it don't get done, then I'll move on it! And that's the last thing in the world you want me to do."
[OTH],"All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something."
[OTH],"Now back to, ""It's A Wonderful Life""."
[OTH],"You-oo you just can't buy people, Mr. Potter, wuh. Why, you know what you are? You're a little bitch. That's right, you're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?"
[OTH],"Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman."
Cartman,"All right, keeps your pants on."
[OTH],"Hey, bring us down some food, all right?"
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"Come on, Team!"
Cartman,Can somebody drive us to the mall?
[OTH],Touchdown!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?"
[OTH],And these Cornhuskers have the ball on the 50-yard line!
Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?"
[OTH],"Not now, Eric. Hold him! He has him! Where's the flag?!"
Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!"
[OTH],"I said ""no,"" and I mean ""no!"" Respect my authorituh!"
Cartman,Damn his Goddamned authorituh!
[OTH],"With only 16 seconds left, the Cornhu-"
[OTH],We interrupt this broadcast for a news bulletin.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Mass murderer and extremely nasty person Charles Manson has escaped from prison! Manson was the man responsible for seven murders in the late '60's. Manson has never shown any signs of remorse for his crimes. If you see Manson, please kick his ass and smash his fucking face in for me, and then call the police. And now back to the game."
[OTH],And they've done it! They've scored 16 unanswered points in 15 seconds!
[OTH],"Oh, weak!"
[OTH],"Eric, I need you to take care of your cousin Elvin for a while."
Cartman,I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
[OTH],Won't yo do it for Grandma?
Cartman,All right. Give me $10.
[OTH],Kick ass!
[OTH],"Oh, Mary. Mary, you're real!"
[OTH],"Chuck, can you turn that thing down?"
[OTH],"Hello, movie house! Hello, burger parlor!"
[OTH],"You know what the spirit of Christmas is? It's another lie, from the lyin' pigs that consider me the witness-!"
[OTH],"Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much!"
Cartman,My family sucks ass!
[OTH],"Yeah, they do!"
[OTH],All families suck ass!
Cartman,Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns.
[OTH],"Wow, sweet!"
[OTH],Heyyy!
[OTH],"Dude, we have to get to the mall!!"
[OTH],"You guys, seriously!"
[OTH],What's the matter?
Cartman,"My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us."
[OTH],"Oh, bummer."
[OTH],I'll take you!
[OTH],"Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials."
[OTH],"Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up in somebody's basement! I want some action!"
[OTH],"Good for you, Charlie!"
[OTH],Come on! I'll hot-wire your Grandpa's car!
[OTH],Do you really think we should go with this guy?
Cartman,"Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people."
[OTH],"All right, boys, keep your heads down! We're goin' to the mall!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],I just can't believe he would go without our permission!
[OTH],"Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something."
[OTH],"Well, I hope for his sake you're right."
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?"
[OTH],"Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon."
[OTH],Wwhat?!
[OTH],Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.
[OTH],"Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!"
[OTH],"Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!"
[OTH],Do you see him?
[OTH],Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
[OTH],I can't wait to see him! He's gonna be so glad we came!
[OTH],I drove all the way from Montana to see Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],"That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous."
Cartman,How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff.
[OTH],Mr. Hankey kicks ass!
Cartman,And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
[OTH],So?!
Cartman,"So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?"
[OTH],"Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants."
[OTH],How would you like to come with me to a more secluded part of the mall?
[OTH],(Okay)
[OTH],I really like that guy.
Cartman,"Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin. God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin! No, Elvin, bad Elvin!"
[OTH],"Folks need to understand that I am terror! I am fear! I am-! Oh, hey look, another holiday special."
[OTH],"And now, back to ""The Grinchy Poo"""
[OTH],"Grinchy Poo went up the chimney and stuffed the tree up
But then he heard a coo, like the cry of a dove
It was little Cindy Lou Poo, who was no more than two
""Mr. Hankey, why? Why are you taking our Christmas tree, why?""
And Old Grinchy Poo thought of a line, and he thought it up quick..."
[OTH],"All right, boys, you're up next. Welcome to Mr. Hankey's Happy Lollyland!"
[OTH],"Hoh, boy. Here we go!"
[OTH],"Howdy ho, boys."
[OTH],Mr. Hankey?
[OTH],"Gosh, you boys smell like flowers."
[OTH],You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
[OTH],Sure I am! Howdy ho!
[OTH],You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
[OTH],"Well, Mr. Hankey has to grow too, you know. Howdy ho!"
[OTH],You boys want your picture with Mr. Hankey?
[OTH],This is not Mr. Hankey! This is a fake!
[OTH],"It's okay, kids. I'm real. Hoowwdy ho!"
[OTH],Hoowwdy ho!
[OTH],Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
[OTH],"Look, kid. There's Mr. Hankeys like me in every shopping mall. There is no real Mr. Hankey."
[OTH],What?! What did you say?!
[OTH],"Oh, boy. You've done it now."
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],Behold! Here's your false prophet!
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Die!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Get out!
[OTH],You son of a bitch! Rip it down! Get out!
[OTH],"You lied to me, Mother. You said it was the real Mr. Hankey."
[OTH],"Uh, well, yes, but-"
[OTH],"I will not forget this, Mother. I will not forget this, ever."
[OTH],This is revolution!
[OTH],Wah-hahow!
[OTH],"Uh oh, they're rioting again."
[OTH],"And all the poos down in Pooville joined hands and they sang
They sang all the same
And he himself, the Grinchy Poo, carved the roast poo."
[OTH],"Wow, man. That's beautiful. He was evil, but now he's good."
[OTH],What's happening?
[OTH],Some kid must have said it wasn't the real Mr. Hankey again.
Cartman,I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!
[OTH],"Well, how was it?"
[OTH],It was a fake!
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sorry."
[OTH],Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
[OTH],"Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?"
[OTH],"Uh, I went to a beauty parlor and had my tattoo redone. Look!"
Cartman,"Oh, uh that's pretty cool."
[OTH],Hey. Where's Kenny?
[OTH],Oh. He's... around.
[OTH],"(Hey guys, what's up?)"
[OTH],"Oh, hey Kenny."
[OTH],"Come on, I'll buy you kids an orange Smoothie."
[OTH],Ooooo!
[OTH],"Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson!"
[OTH],"Run for your lives, boys!"
Cartman,Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously.
[OTH],"Come back here, God damnit! He's getting away!"
[OTH],"Keep your heads down, kids!"
Cartman,Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
[OTH],"I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!"
[OTH],We interrupt this program for a breaking news story.
[OTH],A high speed car chase is happening right now on interstate 3. We go now to our live sky-fi helicopter.
[OTH],"Ron, it looks as though the chase is proceeding west down the interstate."
[OTH],"Oh, that looks a lot like your car, Harold."
[OTH],"We understand that Charles Manson is inside the car with several hostages, all of whom are children My God, what is this world coming to? Well, we'd like to take a moment to tell you that this car chase is being brought to you by Snacky S'mores , the creamy bonbon s'mores in a delightful cookie crunch."
[OTH],They're gaining on us!
[OTH],Fudgecicle!
[OTH],Kickass!
[OTH],"God, I hate the holiday season!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello kids. Having fun-?"
[OTH],Get in the house!
[OTH],"Alrighty, then."
Cartman,Lock the door!
[OTH],"Oh my God, it's Charlie Manson! Whoa!"
[OTH],What's going on?
[OTH],There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
[OTH],"Quiet down, we're watching television."
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip, what a precious gift!"
[OTH],"That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing."
[OTH],The cops are here!
[OTH],Howard!
[OTH],"How did you get out, son?"
[OTH],"All right, Manson, we know you're in there! Come out peacefully, and we'll shoot you!"
[OTH],"Tell him we won't shoot him, Boss."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Come out peacefully, and we won't shoot you!"
[OTH],"Oh, look. Police Chief Stevens got a new haircut."
[OTH],"Get down, Ma!"
[OTH],"Hey, man, don't point a gun at your own mother!"
[OTH],"What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house!"
[OTH],"Well, Howard, you've done it again! You've ruined Christmas!"
[OTH],"This is Robert Pooner reporting live from Nebraska, where escaped convict Charlie Manson has walled himself up in a house. We understand that there are hostages, and that the situation is critical, , so we would like to remind you all that this live hostage crisis is being brought to you by Palmoral Sun Block . Remember, if it isn't Palmoral, you're gonna get cancer."
[OTH],What's going on here?!
[OTH],"We've got a critical situation, ma'am. Charlie Manson is holding everybody inside hostage."
[OTH],Is this the Cartman residence?
[OTH],"Yes, ma'am."
[OTH],Give me that! Stanley! This is your mother!
[OTH],Oh ooh.
[OTH],"What's your mom doing here, dude?"
[OTH],"Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time!"
[OTH],"Wow, she's really pissed."
[OTH],"I'm glad I'm not you right now, kid."
[OTH],"What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!"
[OTH],...Sorry.
[OTH],"Still more developments in the Manson hostage crisis. Uh, it appears now that eight-year-old Stan Marsh is in BIG, big trouble. He apparently disobeyed his parents, left home without telling them, and uh, Tom, his- his mother is very disappointed with him."
[OTH],Damn it! What are we gonna do?
[OTH],Sshhhh! We're watching television.
[OTH],Waitwaitwaitwait.
[OTH],Check out this one.
[OTH],"Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here."
[OTH],"Okay, here I come, okay."
[OTH],"Okay, waitwait waitwait."
[OTH],Come out with your hands up!
[OTH],"Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?!"
[OTH],"Well, there's that old window in the bathroom; you could probably squeeze through there."
[OTH],"That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson!"
[OTH],But I gotta see what happens.
[OTH],"Come on, damn it! Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays."
[OTH],Happy holidays.
[OTH],"Dude, they're gonna kill me."
[OTH],"All right, Manson, this is it! We're coming in after you! There's gonna be a lot of bloodshed, and a lot of innocent people are gonna die! You've got until 100-Marshmallow to come out!"
[OTH],"1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,..."
[OTH],"All right, it's open! Let's go!"
[OTH],'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
[OTH],Huh?!
[OTH],"Please, I don't wanna go back with them."
[OTH],"But Stan, your mother and father are out there!"
[OTH],I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
[OTH],"All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go."
[OTH],"Stan, I wanna talk to you about family."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did."
[OTH],"But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me."
[OTH],"If they don't care about you, would they have driven nine hours to Nebraska?"
[OTH],"I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks."
[OTH],Now can we go??
[OTH],"No, Howard. You go ahead. I've got something to say."
[OTH],"Oh, weak!"
[OTH],"Folks, I apologize for this whole mess. I'm going to surrender. Somebody show the police a white flag."
[OTH],"90-Marshmallow, 91-Marshmallow This is making me hungry for marshmallows 92-Marshmallow"
[OTH],"Look out, he's got a white flag!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed the little orange-coat kid!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],They're surrendering!
[OTH],"Okay, grab a hold of him. You're under arrest, buddy."
[OTH],"All right you, spread 'em!"
[OTH],"You're going back to prison to rot, Manson!"
[OTH],Good! I deserve to!
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"I can never make it up to the families that I destroyed, but at least I'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime is an answer."
[OTH],Stop that.
[OTH],"You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about!"
[OTH],Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
[OTH],"I've been such a bastard all these years, and I finally understand. And it it it feels great! If I feel like- I feel like I'm in my own Christmas special. You see...
Holidays are that special time
When we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozy
Forget about being angry for a day Remember how it felt to be a child
Opening presents on Christmas mornin' 
That's the way that we should all feel now
So I say Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy
Holidays"
[OTH],Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happyHolidays
[OTH],"Happy Kwanzaa, too
From me to you
Happy Holidays, you guys."
[OTH],"Happy Holidays, Bob."
[OTH],"Happy Holidays, Chief."
[OTH],"Come on, Manson. You belong in jail."
[OTH],You're darn right I do.
[OTH],"Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me."
[OTH],"Oh, of course we forgive you, son. It was nice of you to pop in for the holidays."
[OTH],"Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son."
[OTH],"I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help."
Cartman,"See ya, Uncle Howard. Thanks for being such a great role model for me. Piece of crap."
[OTH],"I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom."
[OTH],"Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
[OTH],"Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?"
[OTH],"And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, everyone."
[OTH],"""And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season."" What do you think, guys?"
[OTH],"It sucks, just like all your other books."
[OTH],"Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy Holidays."
[OTH],Shut up!
[OTH],What was that? What the?!
Cartman,"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson! ""Hark,"" the herald angels sin,
""Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled"" Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
""Hark,"" the herald angels sing"
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad. The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again. Yes, Stanley?"
[OTH],That's okay with us.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Yeah, we don't care."
Cartman,"Yeah, that's fine."
[OTH],"No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board."
[OTH],Aawwww!
[OTH],"""Current Events in South Park"". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on."
[OTH],Aawwww!
[OTH],"Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Tolkien, you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek."
[OTH],AAAghah heheh.
[OTH],"Oh, not Tweek."
[OTH],We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
[OTH],There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
[OTH],"I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!"
[OTH],"Dude, we can't work with this kid."
[OTH],Yuh-ugh!
[OTH],"That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought, ""Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?"" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!"
[OTH],Wagh!
[OTH],"Hello there, customer."
[OTH],Hello. How are you today?
[OTH],"Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee?"
[OTH],I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...
[OTH],"Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling."
[OTH],That's right. How come you don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.
[OTH],"Oh, forget it, my store is not for sale."
[OTH],"My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer. This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?"
[OTH],"Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me."
[OTH],"Well, all right. How about $500,000?"
[OTH],"The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee. Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more. And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America."
[OTH],"Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you."
[OTH],But that could put me out of business.
[OTH],"Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!"
[OTH],"Hello, Mr. Tweek."
[OTH],"Hi, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],Who was that?
[OTH],"Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you."
[OTH],The usual.
[OTH],Bye-bye.
[OTH],"Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--"
[OTH],"AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn."
[OTH],"Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about."
Cartman,"How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond."
[OTH],"No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?"
[OTH],"Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!"
[OTH],"Great. A lot of help you are, kid."
[OTH],The gnomes!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],We can do our report on the gnomes.
[OTH],What gnomes?
[OTH],"The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants."
Cartman,"Oh, so that's where all my underpants go."
[OTH],"Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
[OTH],"Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes."
[OTH],"They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever."
[OTH],"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up."
[OTH],No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
[OTH],"They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money."
[OTH],Some things are more important than money. The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.
[OTH],"I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip."
[OTH],"Oh, hello, son. How was your day?"
[OTH],UUuuUunh!
[OTH],That's good. Who are your little friends?
[OTH],What do you mean?!
[OTH],We're his oral report buddies.
[OTH],"Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it."
[OTH],"Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later."
[OTH],Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
[OTH],"Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh."
[OTH],"Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm."
[OTH],'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
[OTH],Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses?
[OTH],Richard!
[OTH],"No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery."
[OTH],Mwaaah! Slavery?
[OTH],"Yes, slavery."
[OTH],"Wow, that sucks, dude."
[OTH],They really have my balls in a salad shooter.
[OTH],We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes."
[OTH],Uunnnnhh!
[OTH],"Come on, you guys! We better get to work!"
[OTH],"Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject."
[OTH],"Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds."
[OTH],"Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea."
[OTH],"Man, this stuff is strong."
[OTH],Kind of bitter.
[OTH],What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?
[OTH],Don't worry about it.
[OTH],But we'll starve and die like dogs.
Cartman,"Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?"
[OTH],(Fuck you!)
Cartman,"Heheh, you suck, Kenny."
[OTH],"Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up."
[OTH],Aooooo!
[OTH],Woohoo!
[OTH],(Let me try! Let me try!)
[OTH],"Yeess, this stuff rocks!"
[OTH],"Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!"
[OTH],Whoopee!
Cartman,"You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that."
[OTH],"Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?"
[OTH],I just have grounds.
[OTH],Killer!!
Cartman,"Ey, let me have some grounds."
[OTH],"Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!"
[OTH],"Hogh, my stomach hurts."
[OTH],"Yeah, mine too. I wonder why."
[OTH],"Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek."
[OTH],"Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!"
[OTH],"Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!"
[OTH],"How's the report going, boys?"
[OTH],Bad!
[OTH],"Oh, do you need some more coffee?"
[OTH],Eugh.
Cartman,No...more...coffee. Blech.
[OTH],"Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you."
[OTH],You did?!
[OTH],"Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it."
[OTH],"No, we'll use it."
[OTH],"Alright. And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Now, when you give the report, just make sure that you read this part first, okay?"
[OTH],There they are!
[OTH],"And when you come up to do it a second time, really, really clear it up, I mean, um, really, really play the sympathy angle. They'll like that. They'll be calling you, and you'll get a passing grade for it."
[OTH],"You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!"
[OTH],Arrgghh! They took them again!
[OTH],"Thanks, dude."
[OTH],"My pleasure. G'night, boys."
[OTH],"Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!"
[OTH],Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
[OTH],"Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!"
[OTH],They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!
[OTH],"""And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America..."
Cartman,"What will become of the endeavoring American family?"""
[OTH],"I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
[OTH],Uurrgh!
[OTH],"And that's our report, I guess."
[OTH],"Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't even--"
[OTH],Great job!
[OTH],"Yes, great job."
[OTH],"Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening."
Cartman,Neither did we.
[OTH],"Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really are teaching these kids something."
[OTH],"Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so."
[OTH],"Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers! Lead the way, boys!"
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],"Uunh, it's too much pressure!"
[OTH],"Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now."
[OTH],"My goodness. That's going to be a huge coffee house, honey."
[OTH],"Yes, it is. They really have my balls in a juice maker. Oh, hello, son, uh. How did your report go?"
[OTH],Waagh!
[OTH],I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
[OTH],"Really?? Well, son, you might have just saved the family business. What do you have to say about that?"
[OTH],I need coffee.
[OTH],"I know how you boys feel. Sometimes a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day. That smooth aroma and mild taste is what make Tweek coffee... uh very special. Special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt-- ."
[OTH],Dad!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"The metaphors, man!"
[OTH],"Oh, sorry. Here you go."
[OTH],Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
[OTH],"Liike, how do you mean?"
[OTH],Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
[OTH],Agghh!
[OTH],"Oh, that. He has ADD, attention deficit disorder. That's why he's so jittery all the time."
[OTH],"Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard."
[OTH],"Oh, hello committee members. What a surprise."
[OTH],"So, this is the corporate bulldozer trying to push you off the map."
[OTH],Yes. How did you hear?
[OTH],These boys did an excellent report for us this morning. They're so upset by this whole thing.
[OTH],My butt hurts.
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee is not going to let you be run out of business by these bastards! Do you hear that? You're not gonna get away with this, you whore!"
[OTH],Excuse me?!
[OTH],"Boys, we've talked it over, and we want you to take your case to the mayor!"
[OTH],Our case?
[OTH],"Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!"
[OTH],"Oh, you'll do fine, son."
[OTH],"Come on, boys! Let's go!"
Cartman,"Aw, man, this sucks!"
[OTH],Aaarrrnnn!
[OTH],...And we would have never even known that this was happening if not for these boys' excellent report.
[OTH],You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?"
[OTH],Yes!
[OTH],"Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-"
[OTH],"Mayor, these boys want that Harbucks coffee shut down right now!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country."
[OTH],But they're ruining our city!
[OTH],"Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law!"
[OTH],Uh... Hooray.
[OTH],"So I guess you wanna do some campaigning. You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up..."
[OTH],Wagh!
[OTH],"...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you."
[OTH],Didn't you see them!?
[OTH],"Alright, what's next."
[OTH],"Next is issue 37D, missing underpants."
[OTH],Is it cold in here?
[OTH],"Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you. Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys."
[OTH],"Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!"
[OTH],"Live, it's the South Park Town Hall Meeting on Public Access. Tonight's topic: Prop. 10."
[OTH],"Should Harbucks be allowed to open a store in South Park? That's tonight's topic. On my left, five innocent, starry-eyed boys from Middle America. On my right, a big, fat, smelly corporate guy from New York."
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],"Hey, I'm not fat or smelly!"
[OTH],"All right, Mr. Douchebag."
[OTH],Postum!
[OTH],"Oh. Pardon me, Mr. Assface. Anyway, let's hear your side of the argument."
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],My argument is simple. This country's founded on free enterprise. Harbucks is an organization that-
[OTH],Hhssssssss!
[OTH],"An organization that prides itself on great coffee! We simply want tuh-- Oh, to hell with you!"
[OTH],"Okay, ucka-fay. Now for the other side of the argument we turn to our young, handsome lads. Boys, your thoughts. Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's your principal argument?"
[OTH],Uh...
[OTH],Uh...
Cartman,This guy sucks ass!
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah! Woo!
[OTH],"Great argument! You win, boys!"
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"That was close, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"What is the future of America? Is it the money we make? The quests we conquer? No, it's children. So what do children have to say about Prop. 10?"
[OTH],I don't like big corporations.
[OTH],I like small businesses.
Cartman,I believe in the family-owned enterprise.
[OTH],"(In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)"
[OTH],Aarrgghh!
[OTH],"It's time to stop large corporations. Prop. 10 is about children. Vote Yes on Prop. 10, or else, you hate children. You don't hate... children... do you? Remember, keep American business small, or else. Paid for by Citizens for a Fair and Equal way to get Harbucks Coffee kicked out of town forever."
[OTH],"Well, what do you think?"
[OTH],"Wow, it it's great!"
[OTH],"Yes, it is. We'll put it on the air immediately."
[OTH],"What do you think, hon? Hon? What's the matter?"
[OTH],I have a big problem with this.
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],We are just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying.
[OTH],"But, kids are great to get people on our side."
[OTH],You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't be a part of this anymore.
[OTH],"Honey, all's fair in love and war. And coffee. Hon? Hu-hon?"
[OTH],Take your corporate coffee and go back to New York City!
[OTH],Yeah!!
[OTH],"It's people like you who are ruining Main Street, USA!"
[OTH],That's right! Yeah!
[OTH],"How many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee, huh?!"
[OTH],Yeah!!
[OTH],"Damn, these people aren't buying any coffee! I'll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd."
[OTH],"Hey, kids. I'm Camel Joe and I love a fresh cup of coffee. It's yum diddly-icious, and it makes you feel super! I have a surprise for you: the new Kiddicino from Harbucks; more sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte."
[OTH],"No Billy, no coffee for you. You should be ashamed of yourself, using cartoons to push caffeine on children!"
[OTH],"Why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from, lady?!"
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Postum, I'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee."
[OTH],"Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea!"
[OTH],"Uh, I'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown out of town."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"At five o'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... Tweek's coffee. Like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on Tweek's coffee to start your day."
[OTH],"Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here. All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like..."
[OTH],Toto.
[OTH],"Like Toto. And then the Harbucks guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes."
[OTH],"Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work."
Cartman,What now?
[OTH],"They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes."
[OTH],"Oh, God, when is this gonna end?"
[OTH],"Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!"
[OTH],"Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!"
[OTH],So what are we gonna say?
Cartman,Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?
[OTH],"'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!"
[OTH],Does anybody know anything about corporations?
[OTH],Waagh!
Cartman,I think my mom is a corporation.
[OTH],"Yeah, that makes sense."
[OTH],You guys! Sshhhh!
[OTH],"Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?"
[OTH],How do we stretch that into five minutes?
[OTH],They're taking my underpants!
[OTH],"Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!"
[OTH],Aaaggghhh!
[OTH],What the hell?
Cartman,"Well, I'll be damned."
[OTH],That's my last pair of underpants!
[OTH],"Sshh, don't scare him."
[OTH],"Hey there, little guy."
Cartman,Bad!
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
Cartman,"Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him."
[OTH],"Is that all you've got, pussy?"
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"Hey, he talks!"
Cartman,"Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!"
[OTH],"You're a pussy, pussy!"
Cartman,Ey!
[OTH],"Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?"
[OTH],"Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid."
[OTH],Waggh.
[OTH],Stealing underpants big business.
[OTH],"Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?"
[OTH],"Sure, that's what gnomes do."
[OTH],Show us.
[OTH],O-kay. Follow me.
Cartman,"Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome."
[OTH],Not much longer now.
Cartman,"Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?"
[OTH],"No, pussy, I'm taking you to my village."
Cartman,"Oh, your pussy village?"
[OTH],"Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?"
[OTH],Follow me.
Cartman,I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
[OTH],"Well, it looks like Harbucks will never make it in this town. All right, boys, that's it. Pack it up, we're movin' out of town."
[OTH],"Aw, but we just finished."
[OTH],"I know, but these folks obviously don't want us here."
[OTH],But what will become of us?
[OTH],"Oh, quit being so melodramatic, Sanchez. Jesus Christ!"
[OTH],"Damn, dude, this place is huge!"
[OTH],Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
Cartman,"No it isn't, you guys!"
[OTH],This is where all our work is done.
Cartman,So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?
[OTH],Collecting underpants is just phase 1. Phase 1: collect underpants.
[OTH],"Sooo, what's phase 2?"
[OTH],"Hey, what's phase 2?"
[OTH],Phase 1: we collect underpants.
[OTH],"Yeah yeah yeah, but, what about phase 2?"
[OTH],"Well, phase 3 is profit. Get it?"
[OTH],I don't get it.
[OTH],"You see,Phase 1: collect underpants. Phase 2: ... Phase 3: Profit."
Cartman,"Oh, I get it."
[OTH],"No you don't, fatass!"
[OTH],Do you guys know anything about corporations?
[OTH],You bet we do!
[OTH],Us gnomes are geniuses at corporations.
[OTH],"Time to go to work, work all nightSe--"
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, look out!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
[OTH],"You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers."
[OTH],Holy shit! We've killed your friend!
[OTH],Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
[OTH],"Christ, we squished him like a bug!"
[OTH],Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
[OTH],"Well, we can explain that to you easily."
[OTH],"Yes, for a price."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],You know.
[OTH],Underpants?
[OTH],Underpants!
[OTH],"Toto, ladies and gentlemen!"
[OTH],"Yeah, Toto! Whoo, Toto! Woo!"
[OTH],"All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children."
[OTH],"Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations."
[OTH],Underpants gnomes?
[OTH],Big corporations are good!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What's this?
[OTH],Good?
[OTH],Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
[OTH],"Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!"
[OTH],Ogh.
[OTH],That's not what you said last time.
[OTH],"Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time."
[OTH],You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!!
[OTH],"These boys are absolutely right. We've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it's wrong. We're as low and despicable as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you ever even bother to taste Harbucks coffee? Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don't you think you should at least try it?"
[OTH],"Hey, this is pretty damn good."
[OTH],"Yeah, it doesn't have that bland, raw, sewage taste that Tweek's coffee has."
[OTH],"Hey. Hey, that is good."
[OTH],It's a French roast.
[OTH],"It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April  morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be."
[OTH],"Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will make a lot of money."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mr. Postum, but I think we'll be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery."
[OTH],Aggghhh!
[OTH],"Just kidding, son."
Cartman,I love you guys.
[OTH],"Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad. The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again. Yes, Stanley?"
[OTH],That's okay with us.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Yeah, we don't care."
Cartman,"Yeah, that's fine."
[OTH],"No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board."
[OTH],Aawwww!
[OTH],"""Current Events in South Park"". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on."
[OTH],Aawwww!
[OTH],"Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Tolkien, you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek."
[OTH],AAAghah heheh.
[OTH],"Oh, not Tweek."
[OTH],We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
[OTH],There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
[OTH],"I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!"
[OTH],"Dude, we can't work with this kid."
[OTH],Yuh-ugh!
[OTH],"That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought, ""Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?"" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!"
[OTH],Wagh!
[OTH],"Hello there, customer."
[OTH],Hello. How are you today?
[OTH],"Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee?"
[OTH],I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...
[OTH],"Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling."
[OTH],That's right. How come you don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.
[OTH],"Oh, forget it, my store is not for sale."
[OTH],"My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer. This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?"
[OTH],"Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me."
[OTH],"Well, all right. How about $500,000?"
[OTH],"The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee. Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more. And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America."
[OTH],"Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you."
[OTH],But that could put me out of business.
[OTH],"Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!"
[OTH],"Hello, Mr. Tweek."
[OTH],"Hi, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],Who was that?
[OTH],"Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you."
[OTH],The usual.
[OTH],Bye-bye.
[OTH],"Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--"
[OTH],"AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn."
[OTH],"Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about."
Cartman,"How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond."
[OTH],"No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?"
[OTH],"Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!"
[OTH],"Great. A lot of help you are, kid."
[OTH],The gnomes!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],We can do our report on the gnomes.
[OTH],What gnomes?
[OTH],"The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants."
Cartman,"Oh, so that's where all my underpants go."
[OTH],"Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
[OTH],"Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes."
[OTH],"They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever."
[OTH],"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up."
[OTH],No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
[OTH],"They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money."
[OTH],Some things are more important than money. The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.
[OTH],"I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip."
[OTH],"Oh, hello, son. How was your day?"
[OTH],UUuuUunh!
[OTH],That's good. Who are your little friends?
[OTH],What do you mean?!
[OTH],We're his oral report buddies.
[OTH],"Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it."
[OTH],"Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later."
[OTH],Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
[OTH],"Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh."
[OTH],"Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm."
[OTH],'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
[OTH],Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses?
[OTH],Richard!
[OTH],"No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery."
[OTH],Mwaaah! Slavery?
[OTH],"Yes, slavery."
[OTH],"Wow, that sucks, dude."
[OTH],They really have my balls in a salad shooter.
[OTH],We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes."
[OTH],Uunnnnhh!
[OTH],"Come on, you guys! We better get to work!"
[OTH],"Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject."
[OTH],"Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds."
[OTH],"Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea."
[OTH],"Man, this stuff is strong."
[OTH],Kind of bitter.
[OTH],What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?
[OTH],Don't worry about it.
[OTH],But we'll starve and die like dogs.
Cartman,"Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?"
[OTH],(Fuck you!)
Cartman,"Heheh, you suck, Kenny."
[OTH],"Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up."
[OTH],Aooooo!
[OTH],Woohoo!
[OTH],(Let me try! Let me try!)
[OTH],"Yeess, this stuff rocks!"
[OTH],"Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!"
[OTH],Whoopee!
Cartman,"You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that."
[OTH],"Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?"
[OTH],I just have grounds.
[OTH],Killer!!
Cartman,"Ey, let me have some grounds."
[OTH],"Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!"
[OTH],"Hogh, my stomach hurts."
[OTH],"Yeah, mine too. I wonder why."
[OTH],"Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek."
[OTH],"Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!"
[OTH],"Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!"
[OTH],"How's the report going, boys?"
[OTH],Bad!
[OTH],"Oh, do you need some more coffee?"
[OTH],Eugh.
Cartman,No...more...coffee. Blech.
[OTH],"Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you."
[OTH],You did?!
[OTH],"Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it."
[OTH],"No, we'll use it."
[OTH],"Alright. And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Now, when you give the report, just make sure that you read this part first, okay?"
[OTH],There they are!
[OTH],"And when you come up to do it a second time, really, really clear it up, I mean, um, really, really play the sympathy angle. They'll like that. They'll be calling you, and you'll get a passing grade for it."
[OTH],"You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!"
[OTH],Arrgghh! They took them again!
[OTH],"Thanks, dude."
[OTH],"My pleasure. G'night, boys."
[OTH],"Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!"
[OTH],Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
[OTH],"Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!"
[OTH],They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!
[OTH],"""And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America..."
Cartman,"What will become of the endeavoring American family?"""
[OTH],"I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
[OTH],Uurrgh!
[OTH],"And that's our report, I guess."
[OTH],"Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't even--"
[OTH],Great job!
[OTH],"Yes, great job."
[OTH],"Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening."
Cartman,Neither did we.
[OTH],"Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really are teaching these kids something."
[OTH],"Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so."
[OTH],"Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers! Lead the way, boys!"
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],"Uunh, it's too much pressure!"
[OTH],"Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now."
[OTH],"My goodness. That's going to be a huge coffee house, honey."
[OTH],"Yes, it is. They really have my balls in a juice maker. Oh, hello, son, uh. How did your report go?"
[OTH],Waagh!
[OTH],I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
[OTH],"Really?? Well, son, you might have just saved the family business. What do you have to say about that?"
[OTH],I need coffee.
[OTH],"I know how you boys feel. Sometimes a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day. That smooth aroma and mild taste is what make Tweek coffee... uh very special. Special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt-- ."
[OTH],Dad!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"The metaphors, man!"
[OTH],"Oh, sorry. Here you go."
[OTH],Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
[OTH],"Liike, how do you mean?"
[OTH],Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
[OTH],Agghh!
[OTH],"Oh, that. He has ADD, attention deficit disorder. That's why he's so jittery all the time."
[OTH],"Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard."
[OTH],"Oh, hello committee members. What a surprise."
[OTH],"So, this is the corporate bulldozer trying to push you off the map."
[OTH],Yes. How did you hear?
[OTH],These boys did an excellent report for us this morning. They're so upset by this whole thing.
[OTH],My butt hurts.
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee is not going to let you be run out of business by these bastards! Do you hear that? You're not gonna get away with this, you whore!"
[OTH],Excuse me?!
[OTH],"Boys, we've talked it over, and we want you to take your case to the mayor!"
[OTH],Our case?
[OTH],"Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!"
[OTH],"Oh, you'll do fine, son."
[OTH],"Come on, boys! Let's go!"
Cartman,"Aw, man, this sucks!"
[OTH],Aaarrrnnn!
[OTH],...And we would have never even known that this was happening if not for these boys' excellent report.
[OTH],You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?"
[OTH],Yes!
[OTH],"Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-"
[OTH],"Mayor, these boys want that Harbucks coffee shut down right now!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country."
[OTH],But they're ruining our city!
[OTH],"Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law!"
[OTH],Uh... Hooray.
[OTH],"So I guess you wanna do some campaigning. You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up..."
[OTH],Wagh!
[OTH],"...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you."
[OTH],Didn't you see them!?
[OTH],"Alright, what's next."
[OTH],"Next is issue 37D, missing underpants."
[OTH],Is it cold in here?
[OTH],"Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you. Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys."
[OTH],"Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!"
[OTH],"Live, it's the South Park Town Hall Meeting on Public Access. Tonight's topic: Prop. 10."
[OTH],"Should Harbucks be allowed to open a store in South Park? That's tonight's topic. On my left, five innocent, starry-eyed boys from Middle America. On my right, a big, fat, smelly corporate guy from New York."
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],"Hey, I'm not fat or smelly!"
[OTH],"All right, Mr. Douchebag."
[OTH],Postum!
[OTH],"Oh. Pardon me, Mr. Assface. Anyway, let's hear your side of the argument."
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],My argument is simple. This country's founded on free enterprise. Harbucks is an organization that-
[OTH],Hhssssssss!
[OTH],"An organization that prides itself on great coffee! We simply want tuh-- Oh, to hell with you!"
[OTH],"Okay, ucka-fay. Now for the other side of the argument we turn to our young, handsome lads. Boys, your thoughts. Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's your principal argument?"
[OTH],Uh...
[OTH],Uh...
Cartman,This guy sucks ass!
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah! Woo!
[OTH],"Great argument! You win, boys!"
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"That was close, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"What is the future of America? Is it the money we make? The quests we conquer? No, it's children. So what do children have to say about Prop. 10?"
[OTH],I don't like big corporations.
[OTH],I like small businesses.
Cartman,I believe in the family-owned enterprise.
[OTH],"(In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)"
[OTH],Aarrgghh!
[OTH],"It's time to stop large corporations. Prop. 10 is about children. Vote Yes on Prop. 10, or else, you hate children. You don't hate... children... do you? Remember, keep American business small, or else. Paid for by Citizens for a Fair and Equal way to get Harbucks Coffee kicked out of town forever."
[OTH],"Well, what do you think?"
[OTH],"Wow, it it's great!"
[OTH],"Yes, it is. We'll put it on the air immediately."
[OTH],"What do you think, hon? Hon? What's the matter?"
[OTH],I have a big problem with this.
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],We are just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying.
[OTH],"But, kids are great to get people on our side."
[OTH],You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't be a part of this anymore.
[OTH],"Honey, all's fair in love and war. And coffee. Hon? Hu-hon?"
[OTH],Take your corporate coffee and go back to New York City!
[OTH],Yeah!!
[OTH],"It's people like you who are ruining Main Street, USA!"
[OTH],That's right! Yeah!
[OTH],"How many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee, huh?!"
[OTH],Yeah!!
[OTH],"Damn, these people aren't buying any coffee! I'll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd."
[OTH],"Hey, kids. I'm Camel Joe and I love a fresh cup of coffee. It's yum diddly-icious, and it makes you feel super! I have a surprise for you: the new Kiddicino from Harbucks; more sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte."
[OTH],"No Billy, no coffee for you. You should be ashamed of yourself, using cartoons to push caffeine on children!"
[OTH],"Why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from, lady?!"
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Postum, I'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee."
[OTH],"Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea!"
[OTH],"Uh, I'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown out of town."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"At five o'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... Tweek's coffee. Like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on Tweek's coffee to start your day."
[OTH],"Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here. All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like..."
[OTH],Toto.
[OTH],"Like Toto. And then the Harbucks guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes."
[OTH],"Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work."
Cartman,What now?
[OTH],"They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes."
[OTH],"Oh, God, when is this gonna end?"
[OTH],"Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!"
[OTH],"Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!"
[OTH],So what are we gonna say?
Cartman,Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?
[OTH],"'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!"
[OTH],Does anybody know anything about corporations?
[OTH],Waagh!
Cartman,I think my mom is a corporation.
[OTH],"Yeah, that makes sense."
[OTH],You guys! Sshhhh!
[OTH],"Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?"
[OTH],How do we stretch that into five minutes?
[OTH],They're taking my underpants!
[OTH],"Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!"
[OTH],Aaaggghhh!
[OTH],What the hell?
Cartman,"Well, I'll be damned."
[OTH],That's my last pair of underpants!
[OTH],"Sshh, don't scare him."
[OTH],"Hey there, little guy."
Cartman,Bad!
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
Cartman,"Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him."
[OTH],"Is that all you've got, pussy?"
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"Hey, he talks!"
Cartman,"Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!"
[OTH],"You're a pussy, pussy!"
Cartman,Ey!
[OTH],"Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?"
[OTH],"Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid."
[OTH],Waggh.
[OTH],Stealing underpants big business.
[OTH],"Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?"
[OTH],"Sure, that's what gnomes do."
[OTH],Show us.
[OTH],O-kay. Follow me.
Cartman,"Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome."
[OTH],Not much longer now.
Cartman,"Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?"
[OTH],"No, pussy, I'm taking you to my village."
Cartman,"Oh, your pussy village?"
[OTH],"Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?"
[OTH],Follow me.
Cartman,I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
[OTH],"Well, it looks like Harbucks will never make it in this town. All right, boys, that's it. Pack it up, we're movin' out of town."
[OTH],"Aw, but we just finished."
[OTH],"I know, but these folks obviously don't want us here."
[OTH],But what will become of us?
[OTH],"Oh, quit being so melodramatic, Sanchez. Jesus Christ!"
[OTH],"Damn, dude, this place is huge!"
[OTH],Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
Cartman,"No it isn't, you guys!"
[OTH],This is where all our work is done.
Cartman,So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?
[OTH],Collecting underpants is just phase 1. Phase 1: collect underpants.
[OTH],"Sooo, what's phase 2?"
[OTH],"Hey, what's phase 2?"
[OTH],Phase 1: we collect underpants.
[OTH],"Yeah yeah yeah, but, what about phase 2?"
[OTH],"Well, phase 3 is profit. Get it?"
[OTH],I don't get it.
[OTH],"You see,Phase 1: collect underpants. Phase 2: ... Phase 3: Profit."
Cartman,"Oh, I get it."
[OTH],"No you don't, fatass!"
[OTH],Do you guys know anything about corporations?
[OTH],You bet we do!
[OTH],Us gnomes are geniuses at corporations.
[OTH],"Time to go to work, work all nightSe--"
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, look out!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
[OTH],"You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers."
[OTH],Holy shit! We've killed your friend!
[OTH],Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
[OTH],"Christ, we squished him like a bug!"
[OTH],Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
[OTH],"Well, we can explain that to you easily."
[OTH],"Yes, for a price."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],You know.
[OTH],Underpants?
[OTH],Underpants!
[OTH],"Toto, ladies and gentlemen!"
[OTH],"Yeah, Toto! Whoo, Toto! Woo!"
[OTH],"All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children."
[OTH],"Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations."
[OTH],Underpants gnomes?
[OTH],Big corporations are good!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What's this?
[OTH],Good?
[OTH],Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
[OTH],"Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!"
[OTH],Ogh.
[OTH],That's not what you said last time.
[OTH],"Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time."
[OTH],You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!!
[OTH],"These boys are absolutely right. We've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it's wrong. We're as low and despicable as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you ever even bother to taste Harbucks coffee? Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don't you think you should at least try it?"
[OTH],"Hey, this is pretty damn good."
[OTH],"Yeah, it doesn't have that bland, raw, sewage taste that Tweek's coffee has."
[OTH],"Hey. Hey, that is good."
[OTH],It's a French roast.
[OTH],"It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April  morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be."
[OTH],"Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will make a lot of money."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mr. Postum, but I think we'll be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery."
[OTH],Aggghhh!
[OTH],"Just kidding, son."
Cartman,I love you guys.
[OTH],"As we steer our boat down , looking for these dangerous predators... Boy, there's a king croc right here. He must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long at least. This croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off."
[OTH],"(Oh, no!)"
[OTH],"I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole."
[OTH],Holy crap. dude!
[OTH],"If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole. Oh, boy, it's pissed off now."
[OTH],"Go, dude, go!"
[OTH],"I'm gonna jam my thumb in its butthole now! This should really piss it off! Oh, yeah, that pissed it off, all right! I've gotta be careful!"
[OTH],This guy rules!
[OTH],(He actually killed it!)
Cartman,I told you guys.
[OTH],"Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching."
[OTH],Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!"
[OTH],"That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!"
Cartman,"Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!"
[OTH],"Get away from me, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Come 'ere, crocky."
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAA!
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],HELP!
[OTH],"Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!"
[OTH],(You bastard!)
Cartman,"Well, he shouldn't have called me fat."
[OTH],Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
Cartman,"Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles!"
[OTH],You guuuys!
[OTH],"Hey, he's still alive. Kyle, you okay?"
[OTH],I think so. Is Cartman up there?
Cartman,"I'm right here, Kyle."
[OTH],"Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat."
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!"
[OTH],"Can you climb back up, dude?"
[OTH],I don't think so.
[OTH],"Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him."
Cartman,"Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach! Bluchluchluchluch."
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
[OTH],"Sorry. What the hell are you doing, fat boy?!"
Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!"
[OTH],"Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here."
[OTH],All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
[OTH],"Dude, it's a dude!"
[OTH],"He's like, some frozen guy."
Cartman,"Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!"
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman! Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends."
[OTH],Wow. Cool.
[OTH],"You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!"
Cartman,"Really? Hey, there's a frozen guy down there."
[OTH],Help me chip some of the ice away.
Cartman,"Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about ""Greased Lightning."" You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-"
[OTH],"CARTMAN, WILL YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND GET SOME MORE ROPE?!"
Cartman,"Aww, screw you guys anyway!"
[OTH],"Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?"
[OTH],"Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!"
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,For what?
[OTH],Where shall we bring it?
[OTH],I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
[OTH],I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
[OTH],"No, dude! We have to name it Steve."
[OTH],Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve?
[OTH],"It's my name, and I found him."
[OTH],"You didn't find him, I found him."
[OTH],"What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!"
[OTH],You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
[OTH],"Kenny, who found the ice man?"
[OTH],"(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve.)"
Cartman,"I think we're almost there, you guys."
[OTH],"Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say ""yippee."""
[OTH],Yippee.
[OTH],"Wait, what was that? I missed the question. Yippee!"
[OTH],"All those opposed, say ""nay."""
[OTH],Nay.
[OTH],Screw you!
[OTH],Ey! Screw you!
[OTH],"Huh, excuse me?"
[OTH],"Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment."
[OTH],But we found a frozen ice man from the past!
[OTH],I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
[OTH],No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
[OTH],What the hell is going on here?
[OTH],We came for our reward.
Cartman,"Yeah, like the kid with the wallet."
[OTH],Reward? What reward?
[OTH],"Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time."
[OTH],"Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him."
[OTH],Really.
[OTH],Sweet. How about Steve?
[OTH],Steve it is.
[OTH],Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
[OTH],"Come on, Steve. We've got work to do. Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available."
[OTH],"This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era. Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996! This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away."
[OTH],"Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here."
[OTH],What about the prehistoric ice man?
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. There is that."
[OTH],"Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell us what's going on?"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do. But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months! Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes."
[OTH],"Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:"
[OTH],"Well, I fell down this ice cavern, and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope-"
[OTH],"The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street."
[OTH],"That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy."
[OTH],Uuuurrr.
[OTH],Ugh? What's this?
[OTH],Mmmmm.
[OTH],Holy crap! He's alive??
[OTH],That's impossible! Do an EKG on him!
[OTH],Uugh!
[OTH],"My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!"
[OTH],"Well, quick, do something!"
[OTH],"No no, we've got to think this through. Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!"
[OTH],"Well, you just can't let him die."
[OTH],Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.
[OTH],"Uh, ughn."
[OTH],Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak!
[OTH],Where... where am I?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What's he saying?
[OTH],Is that English?
[OTH],"What? You're, you're hungry?"
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],"You're, you're hungry?"
[OTH],What's goin' on?
[OTH],Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers. If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a child."
[OTH],"Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak."
[OTH],Gorak's a gay name.
[OTH],"No, it isn't!"
[OTH],Why are you being such a dick?
[OTH],"I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!"
[OTH],Nuh-uh!
[OTH],"Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man."
[OTH],I'll go.
[OTH],"No, I'll go! I found him!"
Cartman,"Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!"
[OTH],"All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes. My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out?"
[OTH],(Blue.)
[OTH],"B L O O uh oh-O spells ""blue"" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown."
[OTH],Steve. You-
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],"Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve. Oh good, you're here."
[OTH],"Oh my God, they revived Gorak."
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying."
[OTH],"Uh, hi."
[OTH],Hi.
[OTH],What'd he say?
[OTH],"He said, ""hi."""
[OTH],Very interesting.
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],What??
[OTH],He wants to know where he is.
[OTH],"Tell him, tell him he's... home."
[OTH],You're... home.
[OTH],In the year 1999.
[OTH],It's 1999??
[OTH],He's been frozen for the last 32 months.
[OTH],"Dude, you've been frozen 32 months."
[OTH],And we found you-
[OTH],What? Thirty-two months?!
[OTH],"All right, all right, all-"
[OTH],Aaaa!
[OTH],"All right, all right, calm down."
[OTH],AAAAAAA!
[OTH],I think that's enough for today.
[OTH],"Whoa, oh."
[OTH],"Good job, dude! You freaked him out!"
[OTH],"Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him."
[OTH],Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!"
Cartman,Killer.
[OTH],Fine!
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,Fine.
[OTH],Are you Alphonse Mephesto?
[OTH],The same.
[OTH],We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996.
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],We would like to... we would like to offer our services in your experiments.
[OTH],Oh? Where are you gents from?
[OTH],"We are from the University, of... America."
[OTH],"Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in. He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in, but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat."
[OTH],Habitat?
[OTH],Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented.
[OTH],Amazing. He looks so much like us.
[OTH],"Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing:"
[OTH],"Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative."
[OTH],How would we do that?
[OTH],It's easy.
[OTH],"As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers."
[OTH],He doesn't look very happy in there.
[OTH],"No, he sure doesn't."
[OTH],"I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!"
[OTH],"Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!"
Cartman,"Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden."
[OTH],"Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him. It's okay, he can't hurt you. It's one-way glass: he can't even see us. And now the ice man watches television."
[OTH],This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.
[OTH],Wait. This could be dangerous.
[OTH],How so?
[OTH],He's changing the channel. Something on the television could frighten and confuse him.
[OTH],And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl!
[OTH],What?!! Rrrowrrr!
[OTH],You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
[OTH],He's my creature!
[OTH],"He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him."
[OTH],"Let him out, dude. He's scared."
[OTH],He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?
[OTH],But it isn't right!
[OTH],"Little boy, sometimes, what's right isn't as important as what's profitable."
[OTH],(Uh oh. Ow!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],What?! I'm not talking to you!
[OTH],Gorak! Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
[OTH],Oh hi. What are you doing here? Viewing hours are 10 to 6.
[OTH],"I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out."
[OTH],"Wow. That's really nice of you, kid. Thanks!"
[OTH],What are you doing here?
[OTH],I'm here to bust out Steve.
[OTH],What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
[OTH],His name is Steve!
[OTH],His name is Gorak!
[OTH],My name is Larry.
[OTH],Steve!
[OTH],Gorak!
[OTH],Steve!
[OTH],What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
[OTH],"Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man."
[OTH],No he doesn't!!
[OTH],Does so!
[OTH],"Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?"
[OTH],"I found him, I'm rescuing him!"
[OTH],Thanks.
[OTH],You're a dick!
[OTH],You're a dick!
[OTH],"You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!"
[OTH],"You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!"
[OTH],"Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!"
[OTH],"Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?"
[OTH],"Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3."
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick!"
[OTH],"I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean. Wait."
[OTH],"I just smelled your britches and they're stinky
Stinky Britches
Stinky Britches"
[OTH],Arrrggh!
[OTH],He's gone! The ice man has broken out!
[OTH],"No, that's impossible! How could he have?"
[OTH],He must have used this... door.
[OTH],"Damn it, Damn it!"
[OTH],We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!
[OTH],"Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war-"
[OTH],Sshhhh!
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Nothing.
[OTH],"No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?"
[OTH],Butlutlutlutlup!
[OTH],"Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature have gone?"
[OTH],I have no idea!
[OTH],We'll never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance.
[OTH],Can I help you?
[OTH],"Leslie. It's me, Larry. Your husband?"
[OTH],Husband? You're not my husband.
[OTH],"Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?"
[OTH],"I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass."
[OTH],That was me!
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Who is it, lover?"
[OTH],"It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about."
[OTH],"Ooooo. Well, sir, let me shake your hand. I'm proud to meet the man whose wife I'm currently sticking it to every night."
[OTH],So you... remarried.
[OTH],"Yes, Lorry."
[OTH],Larry!
[OTH],"Uh, larry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on."
[OTH],Didn't anybody send out a search party?
[OTH],"We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace."
[OTH],"Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused."
[OTH],"Leslie, I'm with Buck now."
[OTH],You're Leslie.
[OTH],"Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together. Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone. Eight and thirteen?"
Cartman,"Well, I don't see any crocs out here."
[OTH],"Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!"
Cartman,"Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got! Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"You suck as a best friend, Cartman!"
Cartman,You son of a bitch cat!
[OTH],"What are you doing, Gorak!"
[OTH],I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again.
[OTH],"Wow, that sucks, dude."
[OTH],"Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over."
[OTH],"Steve, wait!"
[OTH],"What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!"
[OTH],"I've got something to show Steve, dick!"
[OTH],"Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!"
[OTH],"Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!"
[OTH],What is that?
[OTH],"It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see? Everybody looks like you do. Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you."
[OTH],Home.
[OTH],"Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!"
[OTH],"Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!"
[OTH],"No you don't, butthole!"
[OTH],They're coming for me!
[OTH],Come on!
Cartman,"Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face."
[OTH],Was the ice man here?
Cartman,"He might have been, by crikey."
[OTH],"We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?"
[OTH],Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!
Cartman,Wow! Kick ass!
[OTH],"We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please."
[OTH],Des Moines? What the hell for?
[OTH],"We have to get our friend, Steve-"
[OTH],"My friend, Gorak!"
[OTH],"-to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt away."
[OTH],"No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!"
[OTH],"Frosty, Steve, whatever."
[OTH],"Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat."
[OTH],"Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock."
[OTH],"Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now."
[OTH],"Okay, boys. Thanks."
[OTH],"Okay. First one to die, loses."
[OTH],'K.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],O-okay.
[OTH],"So, here we go."
[OTH],'K
[OTH],Go.
[OTH],Wait a second. I think he came through here recently.
Cartman,"Yeah, I think the same thing."
[OTH],"Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab."
[OTH],He can't function out here in our time!
[OTH],"Calm down, calm down."
Cartman,"Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches."
[OTH],Wait! Look!
[OTH],Is it him?
[OTH],"No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake. This is the most poisonous snake in this entire region. Now, what I'm gonna do, is carefully sneak up on him, and jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey! Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now! Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right!"
[OTH],Does he always do this?
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Watch my coat, dude."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],I got my ticket.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],I have to go to Platform B.
[OTH],"Oh. Okay, it's over this way."
[OTH],The trail ends here.
[OTH],The train station? Then he's trying to go somewhere.
[OTH],"Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose?"
[OTH],What the hell are you talking about?
[OTH],"An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!"
[OTH],"Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys."
[OTH],"No problem, Gorak."
[OTH],Later.
[OTH],"You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about."
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],"After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world!"
[OTH],Right on.
[OTH],Cool.
[OTH],"Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends!"
[OTH],Where is he? Where is Steve?!
[OTH],His... name... is... Gorak!
[OTH],His name... is Steve!
[OTH],The train!
[OTH],We've got to stop it!
[OTH],No worries.
[OTH],Let's get him!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],We've gotta stop that train!
[OTH],"Come back here, you!"
[OTH],"Steve! Steve, look out!"
[OTH],They're after you!
[OTH],"Oh, he's a wily one!"
[OTH],"Oh, poo!"
[OTH],"Steve, look out!"
[OTH],"Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. As well as he should be, as I will now jam my thumb up his butthole."
[OTH],Huh? Whah?!
[OTH],Stop the train!
[OTH],"Hey, who are you?"
[OTH],"I said, stop that train!"
[OTH],"Yes, hello. I see you."
Cartman,"They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey."
[OTH],I've got you pinned. I win.
[OTH],Now I've got you pinned. I win!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here! Go get him, boys! Cut him off!"
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],Now for the coup de gras. I'll just... get my... thumb up... here.
[OTH],Oohh!
[OTH],"Aah, the train's not stopping. It's not stopping! AAAAAAAA!"
[OTH],Holy bum-!
[OTH],Where's Gorak??
[OTH],"Wow, that is the God-damnedest thing I've ever seen."
[OTH],Where's the ice man?!
[OTH],He has to be around here somewhere.
[OTH],I can't believe he's gone.
[OTH],"Wait, look! The helicopter!"
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],He's alive!
[OTH],Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines!
[OTH],No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!
[OTH],"I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends! Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya!"
[OTH],"Damn! Well, so much for our plan to use the ice man to take over Sweden."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],What? Nothing!
[OTH],"Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy."
[OTH],"No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him."
Cartman,"Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha."
[OTH],Could we be best friends again? I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
[OTH],Me too. He sucks.
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my- Aha! There's a king croc right there! And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-"
[OTH],Moo!
Cartman,"Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here."
[OTH],"As we steer our boat down , looking for these dangerous predators... Boy, there's a king croc right here. He must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long at least. This croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off."
[OTH],"(Oh, no!)"
[OTH],"I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole."
[OTH],Holy crap. dude!
[OTH],"If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole. Oh, boy, it's pissed off now."
[OTH],"Go, dude, go!"
[OTH],"I'm gonna jam my thumb in its butthole now! This should really piss it off! Oh, yeah, that pissed it off, all right! I've gotta be careful!"
[OTH],This guy rules!
[OTH],(He actually killed it!)
Cartman,I told you guys.
[OTH],"Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching."
[OTH],Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!"
[OTH],"That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!"
Cartman,"Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!"
[OTH],"Get away from me, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Come 'ere, crocky."
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAA!
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],HELP!
[OTH],"Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!"
[OTH],(You bastard!)
Cartman,"Well, he shouldn't have called me fat."
[OTH],Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
Cartman,"Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles!"
[OTH],You guuuys!
[OTH],"Hey, he's still alive. Kyle, you okay?"
[OTH],I think so. Is Cartman up there?
Cartman,"I'm right here, Kyle."
[OTH],"Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat."
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!"
[OTH],"Can you climb back up, dude?"
[OTH],I don't think so.
[OTH],"Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him."
Cartman,"Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles."
[OTH],"Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach! Bluchluchluchluch."
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
[OTH],"Sorry. What the hell are you doing, fat boy?!"
Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!"
[OTH],"Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here."
[OTH],All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
[OTH],"Dude, it's a dude!"
[OTH],"He's like, some frozen guy."
Cartman,"Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!"
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman! Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends."
[OTH],Wow. Cool.
[OTH],"You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!"
Cartman,"Really? Hey, there's a frozen guy down there."
[OTH],Help me chip some of the ice away.
Cartman,"Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about ""Greased Lightning."" You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-"
[OTH],"CARTMAN, WILL YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND GET SOME MORE ROPE?!"
Cartman,"Aww, screw you guys anyway!"
[OTH],"Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?"
[OTH],"Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!"
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,For what?
[OTH],Where shall we bring it?
[OTH],I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
[OTH],I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
[OTH],"No, dude! We have to name it Steve."
[OTH],Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve?
[OTH],"It's my name, and I found him."
[OTH],"You didn't find him, I found him."
[OTH],"What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!"
[OTH],You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
[OTH],"Kenny, who found the ice man?"
[OTH],"(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve.)"
Cartman,"I think we're almost there, you guys."
[OTH],"Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say ""yippee."""
[OTH],Yippee.
[OTH],"Wait, what was that? I missed the question. Yippee!"
[OTH],"All those opposed, say ""nay."""
[OTH],Nay.
[OTH],Screw you!
[OTH],Ey! Screw you!
[OTH],"Huh, excuse me?"
[OTH],"Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment."
[OTH],But we found a frozen ice man from the past!
[OTH],I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
[OTH],No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
[OTH],What the hell is going on here?
[OTH],We came for our reward.
Cartman,"Yeah, like the kid with the wallet."
[OTH],Reward? What reward?
[OTH],"Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time."
[OTH],"Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him."
[OTH],Really.
[OTH],Sweet. How about Steve?
[OTH],Steve it is.
[OTH],Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
[OTH],"Come on, Steve. We've got work to do. Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available."
[OTH],"This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era. Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996! This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away."
[OTH],"Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here."
[OTH],What about the prehistoric ice man?
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. There is that."
[OTH],"Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell us what's going on?"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do. But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months! Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes."
[OTH],"Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:"
[OTH],"Well, I fell down this ice cavern, and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope-"
[OTH],"The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street."
[OTH],"That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy."
[OTH],Uuuurrr.
[OTH],Ugh? What's this?
[OTH],Mmmmm.
[OTH],Holy crap! He's alive??
[OTH],That's impossible! Do an EKG on him!
[OTH],Uugh!
[OTH],"My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!"
[OTH],"Well, quick, do something!"
[OTH],"No no, we've got to think this through. Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!"
[OTH],"Well, you just can't let him die."
[OTH],Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.
[OTH],"Uh, ughn."
[OTH],Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak!
[OTH],Where... where am I?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What's he saying?
[OTH],Is that English?
[OTH],"What? You're, you're hungry?"
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],"You're, you're hungry?"
[OTH],What's goin' on?
[OTH],Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers. If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a child."
[OTH],"Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak."
[OTH],Gorak's a gay name.
[OTH],"No, it isn't!"
[OTH],Why are you being such a dick?
[OTH],"I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!"
[OTH],Nuh-uh!
[OTH],"Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man."
[OTH],I'll go.
[OTH],"No, I'll go! I found him!"
Cartman,"Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!"
[OTH],"All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes. My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out?"
[OTH],(Blue.)
[OTH],"B L O O uh oh-O spells ""blue"" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown."
[OTH],Steve. You-
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],"Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve. Oh good, you're here."
[OTH],"Oh my God, they revived Gorak."
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying."
[OTH],"Uh, hi."
[OTH],Hi.
[OTH],What'd he say?
[OTH],"He said, ""hi."""
[OTH],Very interesting.
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],What??
[OTH],He wants to know where he is.
[OTH],"Tell him, tell him he's... home."
[OTH],You're... home.
[OTH],In the year 1999.
[OTH],It's 1999??
[OTH],He's been frozen for the last 32 months.
[OTH],"Dude, you've been frozen 32 months."
[OTH],And we found you-
[OTH],What? Thirty-two months?!
[OTH],"All right, all right, all-"
[OTH],Aaaa!
[OTH],"All right, all right, calm down."
[OTH],AAAAAAA!
[OTH],I think that's enough for today.
[OTH],"Whoa, oh."
[OTH],"Good job, dude! You freaked him out!"
[OTH],"Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him."
[OTH],Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!"
Cartman,Killer.
[OTH],Fine!
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,Fine.
[OTH],Are you Alphonse Mephesto?
[OTH],The same.
[OTH],We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996.
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],We would like to... we would like to offer our services in your experiments.
[OTH],Oh? Where are you gents from?
[OTH],"We are from the University, of... America."
[OTH],"Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in. He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in, but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat."
[OTH],Habitat?
[OTH],Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented.
[OTH],Amazing. He looks so much like us.
[OTH],"Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing:"
[OTH],"Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative."
[OTH],How would we do that?
[OTH],It's easy.
[OTH],"As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers."
[OTH],He doesn't look very happy in there.
[OTH],"No, he sure doesn't."
[OTH],"I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!"
[OTH],"Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!"
Cartman,"Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden."
[OTH],"Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him. It's okay, he can't hurt you. It's one-way glass: he can't even see us. And now the ice man watches television."
[OTH],This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.
[OTH],Wait. This could be dangerous.
[OTH],How so?
[OTH],He's changing the channel. Something on the television could frighten and confuse him.
[OTH],And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl!
[OTH],What?!! Rrrowrrr!
[OTH],You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
[OTH],He's my creature!
[OTH],"He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him."
[OTH],"Let him out, dude. He's scared."
[OTH],He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?
[OTH],But it isn't right!
[OTH],"Little boy, sometimes, what's right isn't as important as what's profitable."
[OTH],(Uh oh. Ow!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],What?! I'm not talking to you!
[OTH],Gorak! Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
[OTH],Oh hi. What are you doing here? Viewing hours are 10 to 6.
[OTH],"I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out."
[OTH],"Wow. That's really nice of you, kid. Thanks!"
[OTH],What are you doing here?
[OTH],I'm here to bust out Steve.
[OTH],What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
[OTH],His name is Steve!
[OTH],His name is Gorak!
[OTH],My name is Larry.
[OTH],Steve!
[OTH],Gorak!
[OTH],Steve!
[OTH],What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
[OTH],"Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man."
[OTH],No he doesn't!!
[OTH],Does so!
[OTH],"Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?"
[OTH],"I found him, I'm rescuing him!"
[OTH],Thanks.
[OTH],You're a dick!
[OTH],You're a dick!
[OTH],"You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!"
[OTH],"You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!"
[OTH],"Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!"
[OTH],"Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?"
[OTH],"Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3."
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick!"
[OTH],"I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean. Wait."
[OTH],"I just smelled your britches and they're stinky
Stinky Britches
Stinky Britches"
[OTH],Arrrggh!
[OTH],He's gone! The ice man has broken out!
[OTH],"No, that's impossible! How could he have?"
[OTH],He must have used this... door.
[OTH],"Damn it, Damn it!"
[OTH],We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!
[OTH],"Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war-"
[OTH],Sshhhh!
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Nothing.
[OTH],"No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?"
[OTH],Butlutlutlutlup!
[OTH],"Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature have gone?"
[OTH],I have no idea!
[OTH],We'll never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance.
[OTH],Can I help you?
[OTH],"Leslie. It's me, Larry. Your husband?"
[OTH],Husband? You're not my husband.
[OTH],"Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?"
[OTH],"I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass."
[OTH],That was me!
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Who is it, lover?"
[OTH],"It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about."
[OTH],"Ooooo. Well, sir, let me shake your hand. I'm proud to meet the man whose wife I'm currently sticking it to every night."
[OTH],So you... remarried.
[OTH],"Yes, Lorry."
[OTH],Larry!
[OTH],"Uh, larry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on."
[OTH],Didn't anybody send out a search party?
[OTH],"We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace."
[OTH],"Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused."
[OTH],"Leslie, I'm with Buck now."
[OTH],You're Leslie.
[OTH],"Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together. Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone. Eight and thirteen?"
Cartman,"Well, I don't see any crocs out here."
[OTH],"Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!"
Cartman,"Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got! Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"You suck as a best friend, Cartman!"
Cartman,You son of a bitch cat!
[OTH],"What are you doing, Gorak!"
[OTH],I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again.
[OTH],"Wow, that sucks, dude."
[OTH],"Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over."
[OTH],"Steve, wait!"
[OTH],"What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!"
[OTH],"I've got something to show Steve, dick!"
[OTH],"Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!"
[OTH],"Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!"
[OTH],What is that?
[OTH],"It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see? Everybody looks like you do. Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you."
[OTH],Home.
[OTH],"Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!"
[OTH],"Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!"
[OTH],"No you don't, butthole!"
[OTH],They're coming for me!
[OTH],Come on!
Cartman,"Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face."
[OTH],Was the ice man here?
Cartman,"He might have been, by crikey."
[OTH],"We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?"
[OTH],Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!
Cartman,Wow! Kick ass!
[OTH],"We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please."
[OTH],Des Moines? What the hell for?
[OTH],"We have to get our friend, Steve-"
[OTH],"My friend, Gorak!"
[OTH],"-to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt away."
[OTH],"No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!"
[OTH],"Frosty, Steve, whatever."
[OTH],"Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat."
[OTH],"Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock."
[OTH],"Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now."
[OTH],"Okay, boys. Thanks."
[OTH],"Okay. First one to die, loses."
[OTH],'K.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],O-okay.
[OTH],"So, here we go."
[OTH],'K
[OTH],Go.
[OTH],Wait a second. I think he came through here recently.
Cartman,"Yeah, I think the same thing."
[OTH],"Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab."
[OTH],He can't function out here in our time!
[OTH],"Calm down, calm down."
Cartman,"Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches."
[OTH],Wait! Look!
[OTH],Is it him?
[OTH],"No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake. This is the most poisonous snake in this entire region. Now, what I'm gonna do, is carefully sneak up on him, and jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey! Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now! Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right!"
[OTH],Does he always do this?
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Watch my coat, dude."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],I got my ticket.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],I have to go to Platform B.
[OTH],"Oh. Okay, it's over this way."
[OTH],The trail ends here.
[OTH],The train station? Then he's trying to go somewhere.
[OTH],"Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose?"
[OTH],What the hell are you talking about?
[OTH],"An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!"
[OTH],"Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys."
[OTH],"No problem, Gorak."
[OTH],Later.
[OTH],"You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about."
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],"After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world!"
[OTH],Right on.
[OTH],Cool.
[OTH],"Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends!"
[OTH],Where is he? Where is Steve?!
[OTH],His... name... is... Gorak!
[OTH],His name... is Steve!
[OTH],The train!
[OTH],We've got to stop it!
[OTH],No worries.
[OTH],Let's get him!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],We've gotta stop that train!
[OTH],"Come back here, you!"
[OTH],"Steve! Steve, look out!"
[OTH],They're after you!
[OTH],"Oh, he's a wily one!"
[OTH],"Oh, poo!"
[OTH],"Steve, look out!"
[OTH],"Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. As well as he should be, as I will now jam my thumb up his butthole."
[OTH],Huh? Whah?!
[OTH],Stop the train!
[OTH],"Hey, who are you?"
[OTH],"I said, stop that train!"
[OTH],"Yes, hello. I see you."
Cartman,"They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey."
[OTH],I've got you pinned. I win.
[OTH],Now I've got you pinned. I win!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],"Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here! Go get him, boys! Cut him off!"
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],Now for the coup de gras. I'll just... get my... thumb up... here.
[OTH],Oohh!
[OTH],"Aah, the train's not stopping. It's not stopping! AAAAAAAA!"
[OTH],Holy bum-!
[OTH],Where's Gorak??
[OTH],"Wow, that is the God-damnedest thing I've ever seen."
[OTH],Where's the ice man?!
[OTH],He has to be around here somewhere.
[OTH],I can't believe he's gone.
[OTH],"Wait, look! The helicopter!"
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],He's alive!
[OTH],Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines!
[OTH],No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!
[OTH],"I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends! Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya!"
[OTH],"Damn! Well, so much for our plan to use the ice man to take over Sweden."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],What? Nothing!
[OTH],"Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy."
[OTH],"No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him."
Cartman,"Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha."
[OTH],Could we be best friends again? I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
[OTH],Me too. He sucks.
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my- Aha! There's a king croc right there! And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-"
[OTH],Moo!
Cartman,"Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here."
[OTH],"Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame , but please, give her your full attention. Go ahead."
[OTH],"Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. How are we all doing today?! I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?!"
[OTH],"Eric Cartman, you say ‘’excuse me”!"
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],Go ahead.
[OTH],"Children, we are a national choir called, ""Getting Gay With Kids!"" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!"
[OTH],(That sounds fucking screwed.)
[OTH],"Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! Go ahead."
[OTH],"You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest."
[OTH],"Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?"
[OTH],That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen is made in the rainforest.
[OTH],"So, who wants to join the fun??"
Cartman,What if you don't have any rhythm?
[OTH],Excuse me?
Cartman,"Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm."
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass!"
[OTH],Choirs suck.
[OTH],"Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! Go ahead."
[OTH],"Well, uh, that's all, really. So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front."
Cartman,"Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper."
[OTH],"All right, that does it!!"
[OTH],"I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man! You get sent here every day, Craig!"
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],Why can’t you behave?
[OTH],...I don’t know.
[OTH],"What do you have to say for yourself?! Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh- Did you just flip me off?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh- There! You just flipped me off again!"
[OTH],No I didn’t.
[OTH],"Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next! Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric."
[OTH],"Hey, Craig."
Cartman,"Hey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-"
[OTH],It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
[OTH],"Uh, young man, ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors."
[OTH],Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes.
[OTH],"Well, guess what, boys? I think that ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],You can't do that!
[OTH],"(Woohoo!) (I mean, 'Oh...')"
[OTH],I think this will be very good for you
[OTH],But we don't even care about the rainforest.
[OTH],And that's exactly why you need to go!
Cartman,"Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],"Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest."
[OTH],"Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints."
[OTH],"Oh, I didn't realize."
[OTH],"Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?"
Cartman,"Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls."
[OTH],"Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!"
[OTH],"Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone."
[OTH],Nooo-ho!
[OTH],"Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest."
Cartman,Whoopee.
[OTH],And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
Cartman,"Yeah, pretty much."
[OTH],"Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo."
[OTH],My name's Kelly.
[OTH],(My name’s Kenny.)
[OTH],Lenny?
[OTH],"(No, Kenny.)"
[OTH],Johnny?
[OTH],(KENNY!)
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography."
Cartman,The nightmare begins.
[OTH],"Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. Oh! This is so exciting!"
Cartman,"Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!"
[OTH],"Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S."
Cartman,"Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!"
[OTH],"Eric, sit down!"
Cartman,"Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor."
[OTH],(Argh! That's not true.)
[OTH],Your family isn't poor?
Cartman,"Whoa, dude, look over there! Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!"
[OTH],"What are chu looking at, man?"
[OTH],"Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?"
Cartman,Okay. Cleek!
[OTH],"Eric, SIT DOWN!"
[OTH],"Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-"
Cartman,"Oh my God, it smells like ass out here."
[OTH],"Alll right, that does it! Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!"
Cartman,"I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass."
[OTH],"Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?"
[OTH],(Uh-huh.)
[OTH],"You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-"
Cartman,"I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!"
[OTH],"Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?"
Cartman,Why?
[OTH],Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
Cartman,Eh-heheh!
[OTH],"Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow."
[OTH],¿Qué?
[OTH],"Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?"
[OTH],¿Qué?
[OTH],"We're the group singing for the ""Save The Rainforest"" summit tomorrow? Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. Children, do any of you speak Spanish? Don't you dare!"
[OTH],Sorry I'm late.
[OTH],Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
[OTH],"Oh, no problem. Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?"
[OTH],¡O! ¡O! Save The Rainforest.
[OTH],Yeess!
[OTH],Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla.
[OTH],"Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour."
[OTH],"Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song."
[OTH],¿Qué?
[OTH],"All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin."
[OTH],"Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?"
[OTH],"(Yeah, I think so.)"
[OTH],"Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty."
[OTH],"Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow! There's a place that is magical, and full of rain. But now it needs help, because it is in pain. Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore We're spreading awareness like never before! Getting Gay With Kids is here! To spread the word and bring you cheer
Let's save the rainforest! What do you say?!
Being an activist is totally gay! Someday if we work hard, boys and girls, There'll be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world! World! Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!
It's totally gay!"
[OTH],"Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle."
[OTH],Thanks!
Cartman,I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
[OTH],"Fuck off, Cartman!"
[OTH],"No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right."
[OTH],No! That's a stereotype.
[OTH],Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm.
[OTH],This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
[OTH],"Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!"
[OTH],"God-damn, it's hot out here!"
[OTH],Aaah! Snake!
[OTH],"No, dude. That's a branch."
[OTH],Oh. Aaah! Snake!
[OTH],No. That's the same branch again.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it."
Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. We hear this a million times back up in the States."
[OTH],Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest.
[OTH],"Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny?"
Cartman,Bad! Bad monkey!
[OTH],"Eric, what the heck are you doing??"
Cartman,"I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head!"
[OTH],And here is a three-toed sloth.
Cartman,It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
[OTH],"Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!"
Cartman,Re’spect my authoritah!
[OTH],"Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!"
[OTH],YEAH!
[OTH],I wish we could have seen the Yanagopa.
[OTH],What's the Yanagopa?
[OTH],"The Yanagopa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!"
Cartman,"Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!"
[OTH],AAAAAAA!
[OTH],"Stanley, what is it?"
[OTH],SNAAAKE!
[OTH],"Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature."
[OTH],AAAAAAA!
[OTH],"What's the matter, little boy?"
Cartman,"He's a little wuss, what's it look like?"
[OTH],I'm just a-scared of snakes.
[OTH],"Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. Oh!! Agh."
[OTH],Oh my God!!
Cartman,"Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!"
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, is he dead?!"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],My guess would be yes.
[OTH],"Oh, no! God, no, no! Don't panic, children."
Cartman,Bad! That's a bad snay-ah!
[OTH],"Maybe we came from that way. No, nno. Let's try this way."
[OTH],Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
[OTH],(Yeah. Everything is fine.)
[OTH],That's good. Can I tell you something?
[OTH],(Okay.)
[OTH],I think I like you.
[OTH],(Really?!)
[OTH],"Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well."
[OTH],"(Oh, that's great!)"
[OTH],"No, that's not good."
[OTH],(That's not good?)
[OTH],"No. See, if I start to like you too much, I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. And that would devastate me. So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny!"
[OTH],(Aaaargh!)
[OTH],"Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!"
[OTH],"Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?"
[OTH],I’m not.
[OTH],Who's not?!
[OTH],Me.
[OTH],"Benny, will you hold my hand? I don't want to get emotionally attached, though."
[OTH],"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!"
[OTH],"No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley."
[OTH],"Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.)"
[OTH],"Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)"
[OTH],¿Qué tal? ¿Está todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)
[OTH],"Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)"
[OTH],¡¿QUÉ?! (WHAT?!)
[OTH],"Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)"
[OTH],"¡¿Está bromeando, Mackey?! ¡¡¡Más de cien mil personas atenderán este evento!!! ¡¿Y me dice usted que no tendré a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)"
[OTH],"Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llega- llegarán. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)"
[OTH],"Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!"
[OTH],We are?
[OTH],"Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us."
[OTH],"Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back."
[OTH],"Oh, really? Could you brush it off?"
[OTH],"Um, no."
[OTH],"Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!! Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here. Oh my God!!"
[OTH],Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
[OTH],"Me, too!"
[OTH],"Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-"
[OTH],Aaaaa! There's a dude here!
[OTH],"Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost. Cah heh, can you help us?"
[OTH],¿Qué?
Cartman,"Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos."
[OTH],"I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme."
Cartman,Y taco.
[OTH],I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
Cartman,Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
[OTH],"Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype. Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over!"
[OTH],This doesn't look very safe.
[OTH],Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
[OTH],"Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army. They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government. Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?"
[OTH],Who are you?!
[OTH],"Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest. We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José? Um... Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song"
[OTH],Honh.
[OTH],"Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography. Oh, Kyle, please!"
[OTH],Enough!
[OTH],"Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts."
[OTH],"We're not getting gay with any kids, okay?"
[OTH],"Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?"
[OTH],"Heehee yes, we have a phone. It's right over there next to the 12-person jacuzzi. Now, get out of here before we kill you!"
[OTH],Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],"You white Americans make me sick! You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers."
[OTH],"¡Rápido, rápido!"
[OTH],"Run, children, run!"
[OTH],¡¿Dónde putos está el coro?! ¡El espectáculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)
[OTH],"No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estarán aquí. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)"
[OTH],Hello?? Anybody?? Help??
[OTH],"Wow, look at the pretty flower."
[OTH],"Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay?"
[OTH],"Aaaah. Ugh, help!"
[OTH],Ga-ow!
[OTH],I wanna go home! I hate the rainforest!
[OTH],"(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.)"
[OTH],"Oh Lenny, hold me. No, I can't get attached. Oh, but I do like you."
[OTH],"(Well, I like you-)"
[OTH],"Oh, but you're only going to leave me."
[OTH],"(Oh, God damn it!)"
[OTH],"We're here live in San José, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril."
[OTH],"That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, ""Getting Gay With Kids,"" all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment."
[OTH],"Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job! Aaaah!"
Cartman,This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
[OTH],"Eric, where are you going?"
Cartman,I'm going this way!
[OTH],"Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!"
Cartman,"Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah."
[OTH],"Young man, I have had it!!"
Cartman,"Nononono! You nyah, me nyah! Screw you guys, I'ma going home."
[OTH],"Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard! Eric, we have to stay together!"
Cartman,God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat- Yes! I knew it! I'm saved!
[OTH],Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
[OTH],Yeah. It happened once before.
[OTH],No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
Cartman,Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
[OTH],"What are you doing here, little boy?"
Cartman,"I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!"
[OTH],"Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?"
Cartman,Food! I have to have food!
[OTH],"Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!"
Cartman,Chicken wings.
[OTH],Chicken wings!
Cartman,Medium spicy.
[OTH],Start the show! Start the show! Start the show!
[OTH],"La gente está ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.)"
[OTH],"Estoy seguro que llegarán. Eh-sólo poquito más de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)"
[OTH],"Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis chistes de Polacos. (Well, I will try and amuse them with my Polish Jokes.)"
[OTH],Mbien.
[OTH],¿A cuántos Polacos les toma a comerse un burrito? Dos. ¿A cuántos Polacos les toma a manejar a Panamá? (How many Pollacks does it take to eat a burrito? Two. How many Pollacks does it take to drive to Panama?)
[OTH],"Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!"
[OTH],"Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke?"
[OTH],"Let's go, quickly!"
[OTH],"Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people."
[OTH],"Children, it's the Yanagopa. Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest."
[OTH],Damtilié?
[OTH],Damtilié?
[OTH],"Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble... Run for your lives, children!"
[OTH],Holy crap!
[OTH],Damtilié! Damtilié! Damtilié!
[OTH],Jesus Christ!
[OTH],Run run ruuun! Waaah!
[OTH],Aaaaa! Lenny!
[OTH],What the hell?
[OTH],We're sinking.
[OTH],"It's quicksand, people!"
[OTH],"All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""!"
[OTH],Yeah! Fragile my ass!
[OTH],"Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care!"
[OTH],"(Kelly, you said it!)"
[OTH],"Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people? AAAAA!!"
[OTH],"Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!"
[OTH],"All right, that does it!! Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!! I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!"
[OTH],"Oh, now she figures it out."
[OTH],Quick! Everybody help the children!
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],Dude! Bulldozers rule!
[OTH],Come on! Let's get you back to civilization!
[OTH],HOORAY!!
[OTH],"Hooray, children!"
[OTH],How did you know where we were?
[OTH],Your little friend helped me out.
[OTH],Eric?
Cartman,Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
[OTH],"What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?"
[OTH],We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard.
[OTH],Really? That's great!!
[OTH],"You mean, you don't mind?"
[OTH],"Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!"
[OTH],That’s swell!
[OTH],"Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day."
[OTH],(Okay. I can do that.) (Christ!)
[OTH],Aaaah! Lenny! No!
[OTH],Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!
[OTH],They did.
[OTH],"Who's ""they""?!"
[OTH],"You know, ""they."""
[OTH],They're... they're bastards.
[OTH],"Well don't just stand there, help him!!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Help ...him?
[OTH],"Aaagh! Come on, Benny! Breathe! Breathe, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"And now, here to teach us about the rainforest is Getting Gay With Kids."
[OTH],Does everybody remember the new lyrics? And…
[OTH],"Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow! There's a place called the rainforest; it truly sucks ass. Let's knock it all down and get rid of it fast. You say, ""Save the rainforest,"" but what do you know? You've never been to the rainforest before. Getting Gay With Kids is here! To tell you things you might not like to hear. You only fight these causes 'cause caring sells.
All you activists can go fuck yourselves!"
[OTH],That was so inspiring.
[OTH],What a wonderful message.
[OTH],"Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
Each year, the Rainforest is responsible for over three thousand deaths from accidents, attacks or illnesses. There'll be no more rainforests left in the entire world!
There are over seven hundred things in the Rainforest that cause cancer. World!
Join the fight now and help stop the Rainforest before it's too late. Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's knock down the rainforest! What do you say?!
It's totally gay! It's totally gay!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame , but please, give her your full attention. Go ahead."
[OTH],"Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. How are we all doing today?! I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?!"
[OTH],"Eric Cartman, you say ‘’excuse me”!"
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],Go ahead.
[OTH],"Children, we are a national choir called, ""Getting Gay With Kids!"" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!"
[OTH],(That sounds fucking screwed.)
[OTH],"Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! Go ahead."
[OTH],"You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest."
[OTH],"Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?"
[OTH],That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen is made in the rainforest.
[OTH],"So, who wants to join the fun??"
Cartman,What if you don't have any rhythm?
[OTH],Excuse me?
Cartman,"Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm."
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass!"
[OTH],Choirs suck.
[OTH],"Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! Go ahead."
[OTH],"Well, uh, that's all, really. So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front."
Cartman,"Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper."
[OTH],"All right, that does it!!"
[OTH],"I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man! You get sent here every day, Craig!"
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],Why can’t you behave?
[OTH],...I don’t know.
[OTH],"What do you have to say for yourself?! Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh- Did you just flip me off?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh- There! You just flipped me off again!"
[OTH],No I didn’t.
[OTH],"Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next! Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric."
[OTH],"Hey, Craig."
Cartman,"Hey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-"
[OTH],It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
[OTH],"Uh, young man, ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors."
[OTH],Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes.
[OTH],"Well, guess what, boys? I think that ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],You can't do that!
[OTH],"(Woohoo!) (I mean, 'Oh...')"
[OTH],I think this will be very good for you
[OTH],But we don't even care about the rainforest.
[OTH],And that's exactly why you need to go!
Cartman,"Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],"Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest."
[OTH],"Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints."
[OTH],"Oh, I didn't realize."
[OTH],"Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?"
Cartman,"Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls."
[OTH],"Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!"
[OTH],"Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone."
[OTH],Nooo-ho!
[OTH],"Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest."
Cartman,Whoopee.
[OTH],And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
Cartman,"Yeah, pretty much."
[OTH],"Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo."
[OTH],My name's Kelly.
[OTH],(My name’s Kenny.)
[OTH],Lenny?
[OTH],"(No, Kenny.)"
[OTH],Johnny?
[OTH],(KENNY!)
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography."
Cartman,The nightmare begins.
[OTH],"Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. Oh! This is so exciting!"
Cartman,"Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!"
[OTH],"Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S."
Cartman,"Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!"
[OTH],"Eric, sit down!"
Cartman,"Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor."
[OTH],(Argh! That's not true.)
[OTH],Your family isn't poor?
Cartman,"Whoa, dude, look over there! Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!"
[OTH],"What are chu looking at, man?"
[OTH],"Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?"
Cartman,Okay. Cleek!
[OTH],"Eric, SIT DOWN!"
[OTH],"Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-"
Cartman,"Oh my God, it smells like ass out here."
[OTH],"Alll right, that does it! Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!"
Cartman,"I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass."
[OTH],"Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?"
[OTH],(Uh-huh.)
[OTH],"You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-"
Cartman,"I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!"
[OTH],"Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?"
Cartman,Why?
[OTH],Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
Cartman,Eh-heheh!
[OTH],"Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow."
[OTH],¿Qué?
[OTH],"Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?"
[OTH],¿Qué?
[OTH],"We're the group singing for the ""Save The Rainforest"" summit tomorrow? Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. Children, do any of you speak Spanish? Don't you dare!"
[OTH],Sorry I'm late.
[OTH],Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
[OTH],"Oh, no problem. Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?"
[OTH],¡O! ¡O! Save The Rainforest.
[OTH],Yeess!
[OTH],Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla.
[OTH],"Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour."
[OTH],"Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song."
[OTH],¿Qué?
[OTH],"All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin."
[OTH],"Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?"
[OTH],"(Yeah, I think so.)"
[OTH],"Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty."
[OTH],"Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow! There's a place that is magical, and full of rain. But now it needs help, because it is in pain. Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore We're spreading awareness like never before! Getting Gay With Kids is here! To spread the word and bring you cheer
Let's save the rainforest! What do you say?!
Being an activist is totally gay! Someday if we work hard, boys and girls, There'll be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world! World! Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!
It's totally gay!"
[OTH],"Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle."
[OTH],Thanks!
Cartman,I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
[OTH],"Fuck off, Cartman!"
[OTH],"No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right."
[OTH],No! That's a stereotype.
[OTH],Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm.
[OTH],This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
[OTH],"Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!"
[OTH],"God-damn, it's hot out here!"
[OTH],Aaah! Snake!
[OTH],"No, dude. That's a branch."
[OTH],Oh. Aaah! Snake!
[OTH],No. That's the same branch again.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it."
Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. We hear this a million times back up in the States."
[OTH],Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest.
[OTH],"Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny?"
Cartman,Bad! Bad monkey!
[OTH],"Eric, what the heck are you doing??"
Cartman,"I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head!"
[OTH],And here is a three-toed sloth.
Cartman,It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
[OTH],"Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!"
Cartman,Re’spect my authoritah!
[OTH],"Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!"
[OTH],YEAH!
[OTH],I wish we could have seen the Yanagopa.
[OTH],What's the Yanagopa?
[OTH],"The Yanagopa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!"
Cartman,"Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!"
[OTH],AAAAAAA!
[OTH],"Stanley, what is it?"
[OTH],SNAAAKE!
[OTH],"Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature."
[OTH],AAAAAAA!
[OTH],"What's the matter, little boy?"
Cartman,"He's a little wuss, what's it look like?"
[OTH],I'm just a-scared of snakes.
[OTH],"Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. Oh!! Agh."
[OTH],Oh my God!!
Cartman,"Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!"
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, is he dead?!"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],My guess would be yes.
[OTH],"Oh, no! God, no, no! Don't panic, children."
Cartman,Bad! That's a bad snay-ah!
[OTH],"Maybe we came from that way. No, nno. Let's try this way."
[OTH],Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
[OTH],(Yeah. Everything is fine.)
[OTH],That's good. Can I tell you something?
[OTH],(Okay.)
[OTH],I think I like you.
[OTH],(Really?!)
[OTH],"Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well."
[OTH],"(Oh, that's great!)"
[OTH],"No, that's not good."
[OTH],(That's not good?)
[OTH],"No. See, if I start to like you too much, I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. And that would devastate me. So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny!"
[OTH],(Aaaargh!)
[OTH],"Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!"
[OTH],"Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?"
[OTH],I’m not.
[OTH],Who's not?!
[OTH],Me.
[OTH],"Benny, will you hold my hand? I don't want to get emotionally attached, though."
[OTH],"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!"
[OTH],"No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley."
[OTH],"Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.)"
[OTH],"Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)"
[OTH],¿Qué tal? ¿Está todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)
[OTH],"Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)"
[OTH],¡¿QUÉ?! (WHAT?!)
[OTH],"Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)"
[OTH],"¡¿Está bromeando, Mackey?! ¡¡¡Más de cien mil personas atenderán este evento!!! ¡¿Y me dice usted que no tendré a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)"
[OTH],"Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llega- llegarán. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)"
[OTH],"Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!"
[OTH],We are?
[OTH],"Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us."
[OTH],"Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back."
[OTH],"Oh, really? Could you brush it off?"
[OTH],"Um, no."
[OTH],"Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!! Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here. Oh my God!!"
[OTH],Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
[OTH],"Me, too!"
[OTH],"Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-"
[OTH],Aaaaa! There's a dude here!
[OTH],"Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost. Cah heh, can you help us?"
[OTH],¿Qué?
Cartman,"Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos."
[OTH],"I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme."
Cartman,Y taco.
[OTH],I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
Cartman,Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
[OTH],"Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype. Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over!"
[OTH],This doesn't look very safe.
[OTH],Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
[OTH],"Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army. They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government. Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?"
[OTH],Who are you?!
[OTH],"Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest. We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José? Um... Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song"
[OTH],Honh.
[OTH],"Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography. Oh, Kyle, please!"
[OTH],Enough!
[OTH],"Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts."
[OTH],"We're not getting gay with any kids, okay?"
[OTH],"Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?"
[OTH],"Heehee yes, we have a phone. It's right over there next to the 12-person jacuzzi. Now, get out of here before we kill you!"
[OTH],Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],"You white Americans make me sick! You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers."
[OTH],"¡Rápido, rápido!"
[OTH],"Run, children, run!"
[OTH],¡¿Dónde putos está el coro?! ¡El espectáculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)
[OTH],"No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estarán aquí. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)"
[OTH],Hello?? Anybody?? Help??
[OTH],"Wow, look at the pretty flower."
[OTH],"Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay?"
[OTH],"Aaaah. Ugh, help!"
[OTH],Ga-ow!
[OTH],I wanna go home! I hate the rainforest!
[OTH],"(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.)"
[OTH],"Oh Lenny, hold me. No, I can't get attached. Oh, but I do like you."
[OTH],"(Well, I like you-)"
[OTH],"Oh, but you're only going to leave me."
[OTH],"(Oh, God damn it!)"
[OTH],"We're here live in San José, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril."
[OTH],"That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, ""Getting Gay With Kids,"" all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment."
[OTH],"Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job! Aaaah!"
Cartman,This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
[OTH],"Eric, where are you going?"
Cartman,I'm going this way!
[OTH],"Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!"
Cartman,"Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah."
[OTH],"Young man, I have had it!!"
Cartman,"Nononono! You nyah, me nyah! Screw you guys, I'ma going home."
[OTH],"Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard! Eric, we have to stay together!"
Cartman,God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat- Yes! I knew it! I'm saved!
[OTH],Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
[OTH],Yeah. It happened once before.
[OTH],No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
Cartman,Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
[OTH],"What are you doing here, little boy?"
Cartman,"I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!"
[OTH],"Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?"
Cartman,Food! I have to have food!
[OTH],"Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!"
Cartman,Chicken wings.
[OTH],Chicken wings!
Cartman,Medium spicy.
[OTH],Start the show! Start the show! Start the show!
[OTH],"La gente está ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.)"
[OTH],"Estoy seguro que llegarán. Eh-sólo poquito más de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)"
[OTH],"Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis chistes de Polacos. (Well, I will try and amuse them with my Polish Jokes.)"
[OTH],Mbien.
[OTH],¿A cuántos Polacos les toma a comerse un burrito? Dos. ¿A cuántos Polacos les toma a manejar a Panamá? (How many Pollacks does it take to eat a burrito? Two. How many Pollacks does it take to drive to Panama?)
[OTH],"Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!"
[OTH],"Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke?"
[OTH],"Let's go, quickly!"
[OTH],"Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people."
[OTH],"Children, it's the Yanagopa. Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest."
[OTH],Damtilié?
[OTH],Damtilié?
[OTH],"Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble... Run for your lives, children!"
[OTH],Holy crap!
[OTH],Damtilié! Damtilié! Damtilié!
[OTH],Jesus Christ!
[OTH],Run run ruuun! Waaah!
[OTH],Aaaaa! Lenny!
[OTH],What the hell?
[OTH],We're sinking.
[OTH],"It's quicksand, people!"
[OTH],"All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""!"
[OTH],Yeah! Fragile my ass!
[OTH],"Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care!"
[OTH],"(Kelly, you said it!)"
[OTH],"Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people? AAAAA!!"
[OTH],"Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!"
[OTH],"All right, that does it!! Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!! I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!"
[OTH],"Oh, now she figures it out."
[OTH],Quick! Everybody help the children!
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],Dude! Bulldozers rule!
[OTH],Come on! Let's get you back to civilization!
[OTH],HOORAY!!
[OTH],"Hooray, children!"
[OTH],How did you know where we were?
[OTH],Your little friend helped me out.
[OTH],Eric?
Cartman,Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
[OTH],"What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?"
[OTH],We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard.
[OTH],Really? That's great!!
[OTH],"You mean, you don't mind?"
[OTH],"Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!"
[OTH],That’s swell!
[OTH],"Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day."
[OTH],(Okay. I can do that.) (Christ!)
[OTH],Aaaah! Lenny! No!
[OTH],Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!
[OTH],They did.
[OTH],"Who's ""they""?!"
[OTH],"You know, ""they."""
[OTH],They're... they're bastards.
[OTH],"Well don't just stand there, help him!!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Help ...him?
[OTH],"Aaagh! Come on, Benny! Breathe! Breathe, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],"And now, here to teach us about the rainforest is Getting Gay With Kids."
[OTH],Does everybody remember the new lyrics? And…
[OTH],"Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow! There's a place called the rainforest; it truly sucks ass. Let's knock it all down and get rid of it fast. You say, ""Save the rainforest,"" but what do you know? You've never been to the rainforest before. Getting Gay With Kids is here! To tell you things you might not like to hear. You only fight these causes 'cause caring sells.
All you activists can go fuck yourselves!"
[OTH],That was so inspiring.
[OTH],What a wonderful message.
[OTH],"Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
Each year, the Rainforest is responsible for over three thousand deaths from accidents, attacks or illnesses. There'll be no more rainforests left in the entire world!
There are over seven hundred things in the Rainforest that cause cancer. World!
Join the fight now and help stop the Rainforest before it's too late. Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's knock down the rainforest! What do you say?!
It's totally gay! It's totally gay!"
[OTH],"Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?"
[OTH],"No, I don't think so."
[OTH],(How about this?)
[OTH],"No, that's a hair dryer!"
[OTH],May I help you find something?
[OTH],"Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?"
[OTH],Any what?
[OTH],I need to get a nurection for my dad.
[OTH],"Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it."
[OTH],Why is that funny?
[OTH],"Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one. Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody?"
[OTH],That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
[OTH],"(I know, fucking seriously!)"
[OTH],I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)"
Cartman,"Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?"
[OTH],"(Yeah, dude. She saved me.)"
Cartman,"Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-"
[OTH],(Ach.)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
Cartman,What the hell happened to him?
[OTH],He just... ignited.
[OTH],What happened?
[OTH],I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire.
[OTH],"Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room."
[OTH],I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames.
[OTH],Is it contagious?
[OTH],Am I going to spontaneously combust?
[OTH],I hope it doesn't happen to me.
[OTH],This is very scary.
[OTH],The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
[OTH],"...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist."
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth."
[OTH],"Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park."
[OTH],Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
[OTH],"We love you, Randy."
[OTH],"Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],"Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!"
[OTH],Or else what?
[OTH],Exactly!
[OTH],"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays , the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy…"
[OTH],"Oh, here comes the guilt trip again."
[OTH],"Now, let us pray. Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen."
[OTH],Amen.
[OTH],Let's go-
[OTH],Let’s go
[OTH],Broncos
[OTH],Broncos
[OTH],Let’s go Broncos
[OTH],"Broncos, let's go!"
[OTH],"Wow, that was short."
[OTH],"Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately."
[OTH],"Well, I'm Jewish."
[OTH],"You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?"
[OTH],I guess not.
[OTH],"Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?"
[OTH],The what?
[OTH],"It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ."
[OTH],"Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],We'll do it! We'll do it!
[OTH],"Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys."
[OTH],"Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?"
[OTH],"I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible."
[OTH],"Good night, Jerry."
[OTH],"See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen."
[OTH],"Bye, Jer- aaa!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, another one."
[OTH],"Helen, no!"
[OTH],What happened?
[OTH],"God must be very angry with us. But why? How have we angered you, Lord?"
[OTH],"Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no."
[OTH],"Dad, where's our Bible?"
[OTH],"Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else."
[OTH],Or else what?
[OTH],Exactly.
[OTH],...What?
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],Where's our Bible?
[OTH],"It's in the attic with the old LP's. Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?"
[OTH],He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
[OTH],New girlfriend?
[OTH],"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?"
[OTH],Maybe nothing... maybe everything.
[OTH],"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection."
[OTH],"Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do. What?!"
[OTH],"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets."
[OTH],This is gonna be fun.
Cartman,I'm gonna be Jesus!
[OTH],You're too fat to be Jesus!
Cartman,"Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!"
[OTH],Stan should be Jesus.
Cartman,"Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home!"
[OTH],You're such a fat baby!
Cartman,"Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves."
[OTH],"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!"
Cartman,"Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't."
[OTH],"All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him. Now, walk. Do you feel hot?"
[OTH],"Uh, no."
[OTH],Damn it! How come you're not combusting?
[OTH],"Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight."
[OTH],Another one! Another one combusted!
[OTH],No! Has she been doing anything odd?
[OTH],"No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house."
[OTH],Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
Cartman,"This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home."
[OTH],No! I think I might have it.
[OTH],"Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little ""nervous"" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, and things. Lord, is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason? I mean, come on! Amen. And now, some of our darling local children are going to perform the Stations of the Cross."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
[OTH],Die!
Cartman,"Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],Phew.
[OTH],Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
Cartman,"This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak."
[OTH],"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him."
Cartman,Peter!
[OTH],"I don't know you, dude."
Cartman,"Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess."
[OTH],Mayor.
[OTH],"Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. .
Girlfriend --> DEAD
Boyfriend --> DEAD
Call a town meeting tomorrow"
[OTH],"Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park."
[OTH],Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
[OTH],"We love you, Randy."
[OTH],"Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],Shmuck!
[OTH],Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross.
Cartman,Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
[OTH],"Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks."""
Cartman,"Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven. So I guess it's cool."
[OTH],"And then Jesus was lead away to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrection three days later."
Cartman,"Hi, mom."
[OTH],"Thank you, boys. Blessed be the name of Jesus!"
[OTH],"It's a great name, isn't it?"
[OTH],"Hey, that went really well. They really liked it."
Cartman,"Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys."
[OTH],"Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!"
Cartman,Up your ass with broken glass!
[OTH],This spot looks good.
[OTH],Yeah. That looks pretty good.
[OTH],"Okay, cool. See you, Cartman."
Cartman,"Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?!"
[OTH],"Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess."
[OTH],"Yeah, me too."
Cartman,"Well, get me down from here!"
[OTH],"Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection."
[OTH],Then I can give it to my dad.
Cartman,"Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home! Okay, I'm getting pissed now! God!"
[OTH],"All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?"
[OTH],"The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her. You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas."
[OTH],"The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart. Should the gas not be expelled, the methane can build up and then ignite, leading to... disaster. Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long."
[OTH],"You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode?"
[OTH],Exactly.
[OTH],"So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes."
[OTH],Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
[OTH],"We love you, Randy."
[OTH],"Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, my dad's famous."
[OTH],"Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection."
[OTH],"Wow, he died."
[OTH],"Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad."
Cartman,"Hey, there you guys are!"
[OTH],Cartman??
Cartman,You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
[OTH],"How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!"
Cartman,"You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!"
[OTH],"Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus."
Cartman,...Really?
[OTH],"Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap!"
Cartman,"...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet! Dude, superpowers are sweet."
[OTH],"Hi, boys."
[OTH],"Hi, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust?
[OTH],"We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!"
[OTH],"Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay? Hmm, come on. Be good, now."
[OTH],Jesus Christ!
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
[OTH],I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night.
[OTH],"Dude, I think you pooed a lot."
[OTH],"So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay?"
[OTH],"Okay, okay, just go away!"
[OTH],"God, that was not cool at all, dude!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?"
[OTH],Uh. We've been taking care of him.
[OTH],Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
[OTH],"Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples."
[OTH],Apples?
[OTH],"Yes. Apples. Ahapples, get it?"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],Sick!
[OTH],"Stinky apples. See you, boys."
[OTH],I don't think I like this new law.
[OTH],Squeaker!
[OTH],"And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen?"
[OTH],"You're the best, Randy!"
[OTH],"I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now."
[OTH],It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!"
[OTH],Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-
Cartman,Officer Barbrady!
[OTH],T. T is for turtle. Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur…
Cartman,"Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch! Huh, I'm gonna die up here."
[OTH],"We now return to the 42nd Annual Nobel Prize Awards. Here again your host, Whoopi Goldberg."
[OTH],"Republicans are so stupid. I hate Republicans. Republicans are so stupid. And now, here to present the Nobel Prize for Science is Nick Nolte"
[OTH],"Science is good. Science is very important. This year's nominees are: Herald R. Pinkerton, for his further development of the grand unified theory of physics.
Randy Marsh, for his formulated break-wind theory of spontaneous combustion.
And Alphonse Mephesto for his seven-assed Galapagos turtle.
And the Nobel Prize goes to: Randy Marsh, for the theory of spontaneous fart things."
[OTH],"No! No, this can't be!"
[OTH],"Whoa hoho, whoa! Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!"
[OTH],"Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words."
[OTH],"Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!"
[OTH],"Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, honey."
[OTH],"It's okay, I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],I'm just kidding.
[OTH],"Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Why?!
[OTH],Kyle.
[OTH],"Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up!"
[OTH],"We have a very strange little boy, Gerald."
[OTH],"Dude, he's still not dead."
Cartman,"You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down."
[OTH],She's not worried about you.
Cartman,"Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen. Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much."
[OTH],That's not your mom calling!
Cartman,"Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now."
[OTH],How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
Cartman,"You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!"
[OTH],He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
[OTH],"Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade."
[OTH],"Hey, yeah!"
Cartman,"Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my ""I hate Stan and Kyle"" song?! Ahem."
Cartman,"I hate Stan and Kyle
I seriously hate Stan and Kyle..."
[OTH],"My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?"
[OTH],It's already on full.
[OTH],"You wanted to see me, Mayor?"
[OTH],"Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it."
[OTH],I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
[OTH],Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
[OTH],"Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems."
[OTH],"All right, all right. Name your price."
[OTH],Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
[OTH],Done. Just find out what's happening.
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly."
Cartman,Hey you guys. Seriously.
[OTH],"What the-? Oh, what now?!"
Cartman,Chef! Chef!
[OTH],"Children, what the hell are you doin'?"
Cartman,"Just get me down from here! Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!"
[OTH],You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
Cartman,"Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!"
[OTH],"Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],It's really gonna piss you off.
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
Cartman,"Oh, damnit!"
[OTH],"Dad, where's the phone book?"
[OTH],"Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed. Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?"
[OTH],"Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones. Caller, you're on the air."
[OTH],"Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?"
[OTH],Stan?
[OTH],That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Do you have an opinion on global warming?
[OTH],"Uh, it... sucks ass."
[OTH],"Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto. Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park."
[OTH],I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is Randy Marsh! It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!
[OTH],Awww crap.
[OTH],Go get him!
[OTH],We want answers!
[OTH],You've killed us all!
[OTH],Someone's got to pay!
[OTH],It's out of control.
[OTH],"Boy, they're really pissed."
[OTH],"Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere."
[OTH],"Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me."
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],You killed us all!
[OTH],Shove that Nobel prize up your ass!
[OTH],"Oh my God, what's going on?"
[OTH],"Now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust, o-o-or we let our farts out and kill our entire planet. Well I, for one, am not farting anymore!"
[OTH],"Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution."
[OTH],"We don't want your solutions, phony!"
[OTH],Give me that! Yeah!
[OTH],Damn you Marsh! Get out of town!
[OTH],You fraud!
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, help me!"
[OTH],"I, I do not know you, sir."
[OTH],Up your-
[OTH],Arrn!
[OTH],"Yeah, take that!"
[OTH],"Dude, that's my dad!"
[OTH],"...Oh, yeah. Sorry."
[OTH],"The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts. Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say:"
[OTH],I-I don't know what to say.
[OTH],"What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Dude, those people are pissed!"
[OTH],"I know, huh?"
[OTH],Where's your dad?
[OTH],He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
[OTH],"Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad."
[OTH],"Still more up next from the heat wave caused by Randy Marsh. A giant glacier is melting above South Park and the entire town is doomed. And now, these messages."
[OTH],"Having a hard time with male potency? Well, I don't, and I'm Bob Dole. What's wrong with you? Christ, I'm Bob Dole and I can get it up."
[OTH],Are you a lawyer?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],We want to sue Randy Marsh.
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],He gave us skin cancer.
[OTH],"Yeah. He put the hole in the ozone, and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies. Look."
[OTH],"What are you doing, dad?"
[OTH],"Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me."
[OTH],"No, he's not. He can't even get an erection."
[OTH],Hm. Really?
[OTH],"Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!"
[OTH],"Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me."
[OTH],"Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."""
[OTH],"You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right. Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book."
[OTH],It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime.
[OTH],"Dude, that was Star Trek again."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan."
[OTH],"Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?"
[OTH],"All right. Now, let's get to work."
[OTH],"I've been telling everybody that you're my girl Cause I'm not one to be shy You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, just Tell everybody I'm your guy You and me, girl, it's forever
Sha la la la la laaa
I've been telling everybody that you're my girl,
Cause I'm not one to be shy I've been telling everybody that you're my girl,
Cause I'm not one to be shy You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, just
Tell everybody I'm your guy You and me, girl, it's forever
Sha la la la la laaa You and me, girl, forever and ever
You and me, girl, forever and ever
You and me, girl, forever and ever..."
[OTH],Dad. Dad!
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!"
[OTH],"...Right, right right."
[OTH],"Kyle, where's your mother?"
[OTH],She's upstairs.
[OTH],"Well, I have something to give to her! Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom."
[OTH],Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore.
Cartman,Hello-o.
[OTH],Look! There he is!
[OTH],Get him!
[OTH],"Uh. Please, everyone-"
[OTH],"You're a dead man, Marsh!"
[OTH],"Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer."
[OTH],Could I borrow one of your rocks?
[OTH],"It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want. Ow."
[OTH],And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all.
[OTH],See? My dad is the coolest after all.
[OTH],"Well, my dad is, too."
[OTH],Cartman!
[OTH],I forgot all about him.
[OTH],"He's been up there for like, three weeks."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],That's amazing!
Cartman,"Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now."
[OTH],"Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?"
Cartman,Get me down from here!
[OTH],"Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?"
Cartman,"Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts."
[OTH],"Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?"
[OTH],"No, I don't think so."
[OTH],(How about this?)
[OTH],"No, that's a hair dryer!"
[OTH],May I help you find something?
[OTH],"Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?"
[OTH],Any what?
[OTH],I need to get a nurection for my dad.
[OTH],"Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it."
[OTH],Why is that funny?
[OTH],"Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one. Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody?"
[OTH],That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
[OTH],"(I know, fucking seriously!)"
[OTH],I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)"
Cartman,"Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?"
[OTH],"(Yeah, dude. She saved me.)"
Cartman,"Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-"
[OTH],(Ach.)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
Cartman,What the hell happened to him?
[OTH],He just... ignited.
[OTH],What happened?
[OTH],I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire.
[OTH],"Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room."
[OTH],I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames.
[OTH],Is it contagious?
[OTH],Am I going to spontaneously combust?
[OTH],I hope it doesn't happen to me.
[OTH],This is very scary.
[OTH],The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
[OTH],"...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist."
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth."
[OTH],"Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park."
[OTH],Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
[OTH],"We love you, Randy."
[OTH],"Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],"Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!"
[OTH],Or else what?
[OTH],Exactly!
[OTH],"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays , the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy…"
[OTH],"Oh, here comes the guilt trip again."
[OTH],"Now, let us pray. Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen."
[OTH],Amen.
[OTH],Let's go-
[OTH],Let’s go
[OTH],Broncos
[OTH],Broncos
[OTH],Let’s go Broncos
[OTH],"Broncos, let's go!"
[OTH],"Wow, that was short."
[OTH],"Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately."
[OTH],"Well, I'm Jewish."
[OTH],"You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?"
[OTH],I guess not.
[OTH],"Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?"
[OTH],The what?
[OTH],"It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ."
[OTH],"Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],We'll do it! We'll do it!
[OTH],"Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys."
[OTH],"Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?"
[OTH],"I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible."
[OTH],"Good night, Jerry."
[OTH],"See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen."
[OTH],"Bye, Jer- aaa!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, another one."
[OTH],"Helen, no!"
[OTH],What happened?
[OTH],"God must be very angry with us. But why? How have we angered you, Lord?"
[OTH],"Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no."
[OTH],"Dad, where's our Bible?"
[OTH],"Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else."
[OTH],Or else what?
[OTH],Exactly.
[OTH],...What?
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],Where's our Bible?
[OTH],"It's in the attic with the old LP's. Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?"
[OTH],He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
[OTH],New girlfriend?
[OTH],"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?"
[OTH],Maybe nothing... maybe everything.
[OTH],"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection."
[OTH],"Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do. What?!"
[OTH],"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets."
[OTH],This is gonna be fun.
Cartman,I'm gonna be Jesus!
[OTH],You're too fat to be Jesus!
Cartman,"Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!"
[OTH],Stan should be Jesus.
Cartman,"Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home!"
[OTH],You're such a fat baby!
Cartman,"Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves."
[OTH],"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!"
Cartman,"Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't."
[OTH],"All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him. Now, walk. Do you feel hot?"
[OTH],"Uh, no."
[OTH],Damn it! How come you're not combusting?
[OTH],"Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight."
[OTH],Another one! Another one combusted!
[OTH],No! Has she been doing anything odd?
[OTH],"No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house."
[OTH],Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
Cartman,"This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home."
[OTH],No! I think I might have it.
[OTH],"Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little ""nervous"" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, and things. Lord, is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason? I mean, come on! Amen. And now, some of our darling local children are going to perform the Stations of the Cross."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
[OTH],Die!
Cartman,"Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],Phew.
[OTH],Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
Cartman,"This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak."
[OTH],"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him."
Cartman,Peter!
[OTH],"I don't know you, dude."
Cartman,"Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess."
[OTH],Mayor.
[OTH],"Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. .
Girlfriend --> DEAD
Boyfriend --> DEAD
Call a town meeting tomorrow"
[OTH],"Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park."
[OTH],Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
[OTH],"We love you, Randy."
[OTH],"Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],Shmuck!
[OTH],Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross.
Cartman,Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
[OTH],"Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks."""
Cartman,"Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven. So I guess it's cool."
[OTH],"And then Jesus was lead away to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrection three days later."
Cartman,"Hi, mom."
[OTH],"Thank you, boys. Blessed be the name of Jesus!"
[OTH],"It's a great name, isn't it?"
[OTH],"Hey, that went really well. They really liked it."
Cartman,"Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys."
[OTH],"Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!"
Cartman,Up your ass with broken glass!
[OTH],This spot looks good.
[OTH],Yeah. That looks pretty good.
[OTH],"Okay, cool. See you, Cartman."
Cartman,"Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?!"
[OTH],"Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess."
[OTH],"Yeah, me too."
Cartman,"Well, get me down from here!"
[OTH],"Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection."
[OTH],Then I can give it to my dad.
Cartman,"Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home! Okay, I'm getting pissed now! God!"
[OTH],"All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?"
[OTH],"The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her. You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas."
[OTH],"The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart. Should the gas not be expelled, the methane can build up and then ignite, leading to... disaster. Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long."
[OTH],"You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode?"
[OTH],Exactly.
[OTH],"So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes."
[OTH],Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
[OTH],"We love you, Randy."
[OTH],"Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, my dad's famous."
[OTH],"Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection."
[OTH],"Wow, he died."
[OTH],"Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad."
Cartman,"Hey, there you guys are!"
[OTH],Cartman??
Cartman,You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
[OTH],"How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!"
Cartman,"You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!"
[OTH],"Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus."
Cartman,...Really?
[OTH],"Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap!"
Cartman,"...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet! Dude, superpowers are sweet."
[OTH],"Hi, boys."
[OTH],"Hi, Mr. Mackey."
[OTH],Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust?
[OTH],"We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!"
[OTH],"Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay? Hmm, come on. Be good, now."
[OTH],Jesus Christ!
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
[OTH],I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night.
[OTH],"Dude, I think you pooed a lot."
[OTH],"So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay?"
[OTH],"Okay, okay, just go away!"
[OTH],"God, that was not cool at all, dude!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?"
[OTH],Uh. We've been taking care of him.
[OTH],Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
[OTH],"Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples."
[OTH],Apples?
[OTH],"Yes. Apples. Ahapples, get it?"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],Sick!
[OTH],"Stinky apples. See you, boys."
[OTH],I don't think I like this new law.
[OTH],Squeaker!
[OTH],"And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen?"
[OTH],"You're the best, Randy!"
[OTH],"I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now."
[OTH],It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!"
[OTH],Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-
Cartman,Officer Barbrady!
[OTH],T. T is for turtle. Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur…
Cartman,"Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch! Huh, I'm gonna die up here."
[OTH],"We now return to the 42nd Annual Nobel Prize Awards. Here again your host, Whoopi Goldberg."
[OTH],"Republicans are so stupid. I hate Republicans. Republicans are so stupid. And now, here to present the Nobel Prize for Science is Nick Nolte"
[OTH],"Science is good. Science is very important. This year's nominees are: Herald R. Pinkerton, for his further development of the grand unified theory of physics.

And the Nobel Prize goes to: Randy Marsh, for the theory of spontaneous fart things."
[OTH],"No! No, this can't be!"
[OTH],"Whoa hoho, whoa! Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!"
[OTH],"Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words."
[OTH],"Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!"
[OTH],"Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, honey."
[OTH],"It's okay, I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],I'm just kidding.
[OTH],"Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Why?!
[OTH],Kyle.
[OTH],"Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up!"
[OTH],"We have a very strange little boy, Gerald."
[OTH],"Dude, he's still not dead."
Cartman,"You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down."
[OTH],She's not worried about you.
Cartman,"Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen. Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much."
[OTH],That's not your mom calling!
Cartman,"Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now."
[OTH],How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
Cartman,"You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!"
[OTH],He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
[OTH],"Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade."
[OTH],"Hey, yeah!"
Cartman,"Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my ""I hate Stan and Kyle"" song?! Ahem."
Cartman,"I hate Stan and Kyle
I seriously hate Stan and Kyle..."
[OTH],"My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?"
[OTH],It's already on full.
[OTH],"You wanted to see me, Mayor?"
[OTH],"Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it."
[OTH],I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
[OTH],Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
[OTH],"Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems."
[OTH],"All right, all right. Name your price."
[OTH],Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
[OTH],Done. Just find out what's happening.
[OTH],"Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly."
Cartman,Hey you guys. Seriously.
[OTH],"What the-? Oh, what now?!"
Cartman,Chef! Chef!
[OTH],"Children, what the hell are you doin'?"
Cartman,"Just get me down from here! Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!"
[OTH],You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
Cartman,"Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!"
[OTH],"Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],It's really gonna piss you off.
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
Cartman,"Oh, damnit!"
[OTH],"Dad, where's the phone book?"
[OTH],"Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed. Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?"
[OTH],"Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones. Caller, you're on the air."
[OTH],"Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?"
[OTH],Stan?
[OTH],That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Do you have an opinion on global warming?
[OTH],"Uh, it... sucks ass."
[OTH],"Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto. Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park."
[OTH],I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is Randy Marsh! It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!
[OTH],Awww crap.
[OTH],Go get him!
[OTH],We want answers!
[OTH],You've killed us all!
[OTH],Someone's got to pay!
[OTH],It's out of control.
[OTH],"Boy, they're really pissed."
[OTH],"Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere."
[OTH],"Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me."
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],You killed us all!
[OTH],Shove that Nobel prize up your ass!
[OTH],"Oh my God, what's going on?"
[OTH],"Now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust, o-o-or we let our farts out and kill our entire planet. Well I, for one, am not farting anymore!"
[OTH],"Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution."
[OTH],"We don't want your solutions, phony!"
[OTH],Give me that! Yeah!
[OTH],Damn you Marsh! Get out of town!
[OTH],You fraud!
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, help me!"
[OTH],"I, I do not know you, sir."
[OTH],Up your-
[OTH],Arrn!
[OTH],"Yeah, take that!"
[OTH],"Dude, that's my dad!"
[OTH],"...Oh, yeah. Sorry."
[OTH],"The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts. Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say:"
[OTH],I-I don't know what to say.
[OTH],"What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Dude, those people are pissed!"
[OTH],"I know, huh?"
[OTH],Where's your dad?
[OTH],He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
[OTH],"Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad."
[OTH],"Still more up next from the heat wave caused by Randy Marsh. A giant glacier is melting above South Park and the entire town is doomed. And now, these messages."
[OTH],"Having a hard time with male potency? Well, I don't, and I'm Bob Dole. What's wrong with you? Christ, I'm Bob Dole and I can get it up."
[OTH],Are you a lawyer?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],We want to sue Randy Marsh.
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],He gave us skin cancer.
[OTH],"Yeah. He put the hole in the ozone, and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies. Look."
[OTH],"What are you doing, dad?"
[OTH],"Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me."
[OTH],"No, he's not. He can't even get an erection."
[OTH],Hm. Really?
[OTH],"Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!"
[OTH],"Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me."
[OTH],"Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."""
[OTH],"You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right. Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book."
[OTH],It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime.
[OTH],"Dude, that was Star Trek again."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan."
[OTH],"Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?"
[OTH],"All right. Now, let's get to work."
[OTH],"I've been telling everybody that you're my girl Cause I'm not one to be shy You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, just Tell everybody I'm your guy You and me, girl, it's forever
Sha la la la la laaa
I've been telling everybody that you're my girl,
Cause I'm not one to be shy I've been telling everybody that you're my girl,
Cause I'm not one to be shy You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, just
Tell everybody I'm your guy You and me, girl, it's forever
Sha la la la la laaa You and me, girl, forever and ever
You and me, girl, forever and ever
You and me, girl, forever and ever..."
[OTH],Dad. Dad!
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!"
[OTH],"...Right, right right."
[OTH],"Kyle, where's your mother?"
[OTH],She's upstairs.
[OTH],"Well, I have something to give to her! Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom."
[OTH],Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore.
Cartman,Hello-o.
[OTH],Look! There he is!
[OTH],Get him!
[OTH],"Uh. Please, everyone-"
[OTH],"You're a dead man, Marsh!"
[OTH],"Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer."
[OTH],Could I borrow one of your rocks?
[OTH],"It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want. Ow."
[OTH],And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all.
[OTH],See? My dad is the coolest after all.
[OTH],"Well, my dad is, too."
[OTH],Cartman!
[OTH],I forgot all about him.
[OTH],"He's been up there for like, three weeks."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],That's amazing!
Cartman,"Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now."
[OTH],"Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?"
Cartman,Get me down from here!
[OTH],"Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?"
Cartman,"Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts."
Cartman,"Mom, please can we just leave?"
[OTH],"You have to see the eye doctor, Eric."
Cartman,But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
[OTH],"You're not fat, you're big-boned."
Cartman,"That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason."
[OTH],Eric Cartman.
Cartman,Weak.
[OTH],"Hello, Eric."
Cartman,"Hi, Doctor Lout."
[OTH],How's my little piggy today?
Cartman,Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
[OTH],I just say that because you're my little buddy.
Cartman,"I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!"
[OTH],Hop up on the chair. Don't break it now!
Cartman,God damn it!
[OTH],Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing. All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
Cartman,Yes.
[OTH],"All right, read them out for me."
Cartman,I am a little piggy. Ey! That does it! Mom!
[OTH],"No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence. I do not know how that happened. ""I am a little piggy."" Wow! What are the odds of that? All right, let's get down to business, shall we?"
Cartman,Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
[OTH],"Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?"
Cartman,They look exactly the same.
[OTH],Just pick one. Or two.
Cartman,"I don't know, two!"
[OTH],"Okay. One, or two? One, or two?"
Cartman,"Uh, one."
[OTH],"One, or two? One, or two?"
Cartman,Two.
[OTH],"No! The answer is one, piggy! One!"
Cartman,Ow! I hate you!
[OTH],"Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests."
[OTH],I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
[OTH],"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch."
[OTH],{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.}
[OTH],"Yeah. Oh, here he comes."
Cartman,Hey dudes.
[OTH],"Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman?"
Cartman,My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
[OTH],Why?
Cartman,"Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!"
[OTH],Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
Cartman,"Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do."
[OTH],"Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do."
Cartman,"Hey, yeah! Ow!"
[OTH],Hey Chef!
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
Cartman,"Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy."
[OTH],It's time for lunch-e-roo
[OTH],Where's Chef?
[OTH],Chef quit.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp."
[OTH],Mr. Derp?
[OTH],"When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp. Ooo! Derp! Derp! O-hoh wasn't that silly kids?"
[OTH],Why did Chef quit?
[OTH],"Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone. Oh, I don't feel so good. Derp!"
[OTH],Could you just hand us some food please?
[OTH],"Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!"
Cartman,Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
[OTH],Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
[OTH],"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back."
Cartman,"I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"Oh! Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today."
[OTH],Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
[OTH],"Yeah, but we didn't believe them."
[OTH],"Well, it's true."
[OTH],But why? Why would you quit?
[OTH],"Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off."
[OTH],So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
[OTH],"No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked."
[OTH],Talked?!
[OTH],"Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself."
[OTH],Oh! What darling little children.
[OTH],"Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica."
[OTH],"That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!"
[OTH],"Children, Veronica is moving in with me."
[OTH],Moving in?!
[OTH],I'm in love.
[OTH],Love?!
[OTH],"Oh, you knight."
[OTH],What the hell is going on?!
[OTH],Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
[OTH],"Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you."
[OTH],"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better."
[OTH],"Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too."
[OTH],What's the problem?
Cartman,"My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean."
[OTH],"Oh, I know just the song for you. There's got to be a morning after
if we can hold on to the night"
[OTH],We have a chance to find the sunshine.
[OTH],Let's keep on looking for the light.
[OTH],"This... is insane. [
""Oh, can't you see the-""

]"
[OTH],That bitch!
[OTH],She's stealing Chef from us.
[OTH],He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
Cartman,Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
[OTH],"Wait you guys. Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new?"
[OTH],"Yeah, so?"
[OTH],"...Yeah, screw that bitch."
Cartman,"Bitch, I hate that bitch!"
[OTH],"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around."
[OTH],Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
[OTH],Good idea.
[OTH],"All right, we got the test results back, piggy-"
Cartman,Stop calling me piggy!
[OTH],You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
Cartman,"So, what does that mean?"
[OTH],"It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better."
Cartman,"All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!"
[OTH],"Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new."
Cartman,"Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me."
[OTH],"I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses."
Cartman,I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
[OTH],That's why we have the little stapler.
Cartman,Ow! Son of a bitch!
[OTH],They said that Chef works in one of these buildings
Cartman,Hey dudes. Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
[OTH],Dude! Just take them off!
Cartman,I can't! They're stapled to my head! I hate you guys.
[OTH],Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?
[OTH],We wanna talk to Chef.
[OTH],Chef?
[OTH],"He's a big guy, with a beard."
[OTH],And a chef hat.
[OTH],{And a real huge dick.}
[OTH],Oh! The black guy!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Third cubicle on the left Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?
Cartman,"Uh, yeah, sure sure."
[OTH],Wow! You really got fat.
Cartman,Ey!
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],"Eric, you got glasses!"
[OTH],"Chef, you have to dump the bitch!"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"We need you, Chef."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?"
[OTH],You bet!
[OTH],"Chef, this place isn't you!"
[OTH],"Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old."
[OTH],But we don't like her.
[OTH],Why not??
[OTH],I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
[OTH],"Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day."
[OTH],"No way, dude!"
Cartman,"Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses."
[OTH],That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
Cartman,Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
[OTH],You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
[OTH],Okay!
[OTH],Chef should be here any minute.
[OTH],Dude! He bailed on us!
[OTH],I can't believe it!
[OTH],Come on! We're going to his house!
[OTH],"Oh! Uh, hello there, children."
[OTH],"All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!"
[OTH],"Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot."
[OTH],You forgot!
[OTH],Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner. She's so amazing.
[OTH],"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!"
[OTH],"Hello, children!"
Cartman,"Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?"
[OTH],"Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married."
[OTH],Oh no! No nononononono!
[OTH],"My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too."
[OTH],This is so wonderful! Let's sing! There's got to be a morning after.
[OTH],If we can hold on through the night. We have a chance to find the sunshine.
[OTH],"And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review. Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant. Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time."
[OTH],"Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so."
[OTH],"All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?"
[OTH],"Oh, the old succubus syndrome."
[OTH],What's a succubus?
[OTH],A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
[OTH],That's it!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love."
[OTH],This is totally what's happening!
[OTH],"Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],"Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say ""get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"""
[OTH],"Thanks, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Sure, kids."
[OTH],You're not fooling anyone!
[OTH],"Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!"
[OTH],Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
[OTH],Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him.
[OTH],"There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor."
Cartman,"Oh, no!"
[OTH],Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
Cartman,"Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow."
[OTH],"Now, hon."
Cartman,But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],I'm Chef's father. We just flew in for the wedding.
[OTH],"Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him."
[OTH],"Well, come on in."
[OTH],There he is!
[OTH],"Chef, we have to talk to you!"
[OTH],"Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back."
[OTH],"Well, aren't you crackers just cute as the dickens?"
[OTH],You're Chef's parents?
[OTH],"Yes, all his life."
[OTH],We have to talk to him!
[OTH],"Well, he should be out now directly."
[OTH],"Oh, he's so excited about the wedding now."
[OTH],"Say, would you crackers like to hear about the time we saw the Loch Ness monster?"
[OTH],"No, that's okay."
[OTH],"Ooh, it must've been about seven, eight years ago. Me and the little lady was out on this boat, you see, all alone at night, when all of a sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the paleolithic era, comes out of the water."
[OTH],"We was so scared, Lord have mercy, I jumped up in the boat and I said ""Thomas, what on earth is that creature?!"""
[OTH],"It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-"
[OTH],"Oh, it was so scary!"
[OTH],"and I yelled. I said, ""What do you want from us, monster?!"" And the monster bent down and said, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty."""
[OTH],What's tree-fitty?
[OTH],Three dollars and fifty cents.
[OTH],Tree-fitty.
[OTH],He wanted money?
[OTH],"That's right. I said ""I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"""
[OTH],I gave him a dollar.
[OTH],She gave him a dollar.
[OTH],I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar.
[OTH],"Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!"
[OTH],"Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right?"
Cartman,Hey! You son of a bitch!
[OTH],All right. Time to laser me a little piggy.
Cartman,"Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh- I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh"
[OTH],I bet his mom wishes she could do that.
[OTH],"And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-"
[OTH],August.
[OTH],"August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-"
[OTH],"And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all."
[OTH],"And she says to me, ""How would you like to buy some cookies?"" And I said ""Well, what kind do you have?"" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-"
[OTH],Raisin oatmeal.
[OTH],"Raisin oatmeal, and I said ""We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?"" And she looks at me and she says, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty."""
[OTH],...Tree-fitty.
[OTH],"Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era."
[OTH],The Loch Ness monster.
[OTH],"I said, ""Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!"" It said, ""how about just two-fitty?"" I said, ""Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!"""
[OTH],"Lord, he was angry."
[OTH],"Damn right, I was angry!"
[OTH],"Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass."
[OTH],"Aah, shut your mouth, woman!"
[OTH],"Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?"
[OTH],"Sure. That crazy old monster Now, then the fourth time I saw the..."
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!"
Cartman,That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
[OTH],"Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman."
Cartman,"Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?"
[OTH],"Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us."
[OTH],"Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right?"
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie."
Cartman,Aaah! It's the succubus!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"We know what you are, lady!"
[OTH],Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
[OTH],A what?
[OTH],A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
[OTH],"Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?"
[OTH],"Well, you are taking Chef from us."
[OTH],"Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand?"
[OTH],I guess.
[OTH],"Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow, And there's not a God-damned thing you can do about it! Toodle-oo!"
[OTH],Jesus dude!
Cartman,What? What happened?
[OTH],"Could I have your attention please? Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady. I'm very happy for them both. Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now."
[OTH],"It's okay, pop."
[OTH],"Thomas, you're gonna get me going now."
[OTH],"Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, ""Poppa, poppa!"" I said ""What do you need, Chef, my boy?"", and he said, ""...I need about tree-fitty."""
[OTH],...Tree-fitty.
[OTH],"Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, ""Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?"" He said, ""My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it."" I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!"
[OTH],"Oh, it was scary!"
[OTH],"I said, ""Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!"""
[OTH],"Excuse me! We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news."
[OTH],This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
[OTH],Children! That hurts my feelings.
[OTH],"Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!"
[OTH],"All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!"
[OTH],"Chef, but-"
[OTH],"No buts, Stan! I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party."
[OTH],"So I chased the monster down the street, you see..."
[OTH],I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
[OTH],No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
[OTH],"Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them."
Cartman,"You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep."
[OTH],Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
Cartman,"You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep."
[OTH],"Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."""
[OTH],What the hell does that mean?
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)"
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)"
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],(That's what that means!)
[OTH],Oh-hoho!
[OTH],"Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? 
There's got to be a morning after."
Cartman,"If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together..."
[OTH],That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
[OTH],In three hours.
[OTH],Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open.
[OTH],"We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song. You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman??"
[OTH],He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
Cartman,What what what?
[OTH],God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
Cartman,"I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!"
[OTH],"...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that."
[OTH],We had taco salad that night.
[OTH],"Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, ""What do you want from me, alien?!"" and do you know what he said?"
[OTH],Tree-fitty.
[OTH],"Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, ""tree-fitty."" And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!"
[OTH],I had just given him tree-fitty the week before.
[OTH],What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
[OTH],He tricked me.
[OTH],Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!
[OTH],There she is!
[OTH],Bitch. Bitch.
[OTH],Bitch.
[OTH],Bitch.
[OTH],Dirty bitch.
[OTH],All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"Do you, Chef, take this woman as your lawful-wedded wife, to have and to-"
[OTH],Iii do!
[OTH],"Aaah, my baby's getting married!"
[OTH],"And do you, Veronica, take Chef to be your daddy?"
[OTH],I do!
[OTH],And now a special sharing of vows through song.
[OTH],Here it goes.
[OTH],There's got to be a morning after.
[OTH],"Now, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Now, Cartman!!"
[OTH],Children! You are screwing up my wedding!
[OTH],I'll take care of them!
[OTH],Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!!
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"Light the for looking on keep let's

[OTH],"Hoh, wow! You don't see that every day!"
[OTH],"We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!"
[OTH],"No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her."
[OTH],Poontang's poontang.
[OTH],"Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream."
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef!"
[OTH],How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?
[OTH],We'd love them!
[OTH],It's great to have you back Chef!
[OTH],"Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.And then you're left with nothing, cause your thinking with your dong. So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!Just play it cool and don't be a fool..."
[OTH],And never let poontang come between you and your friend.
[OTH],"Daaamn right, Garrison!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?"
Cartman,"After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!"
[OTH],"I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes."
Cartman,"No, not with my eyes. With these! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
[OTH],Was he an organ donor?
Cartman,Eh-sure.
[OTH],"All right, then let's get to work. Say, you don't have three dollars and fifty cents on you, do you?"
[OTH],"Light the for looking on keep let's

Cartman,"Mom, please can we just leave?"
[OTH],"You have to see the eye doctor, Eric."
Cartman,But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
[OTH],"You're not fat, you're big-boned."
Cartman,"That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason."
[OTH],Eric Cartman.
Cartman,Weak.
[OTH],"Hello, Eric."
Cartman,"Hi, Doctor Lout."
[OTH],How's my little piggy today?
Cartman,Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
[OTH],I just say that because you're my little buddy.
Cartman,"I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!"
[OTH],Hop up on the chair. Don't break it now!
Cartman,God damn it!
[OTH],Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing. All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
Cartman,Yes.
[OTH],"All right, read them out for me."
Cartman,I am a little piggy. Ey! That does it! Mom!
[OTH],"No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence. I do not know how that happened. ""I am a little piggy."" Wow! What are the odds of that? All right, let's get down to business, shall we?"
Cartman,Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
[OTH],"Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?"
Cartman,They look exactly the same.
[OTH],Just pick one. Or two.
Cartman,"I don't know, two!"
[OTH],"Okay. One, or two? One, or two?"
Cartman,"Uh, one."
[OTH],"One, or two? One, or two?"
Cartman,Two.
[OTH],"No! The answer is one, piggy! One!"
Cartman,Ow! I hate you!
[OTH],"Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests."
[OTH],I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
[OTH],"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch."
[OTH],{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.}
[OTH],"Yeah. Oh, here he comes."
Cartman,Hey dudes.
[OTH],"Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman?"
Cartman,My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
[OTH],Why?
Cartman,"Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!"
[OTH],Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
Cartman,"Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do."
[OTH],"Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do."
Cartman,"Hey, yeah! Ow!"
[OTH],Hey Chef!
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
Cartman,"Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy."
[OTH],It's time for lunch-e-roo
[OTH],Where's Chef?
[OTH],Chef quit.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp."
[OTH],Mr. Derp?
[OTH],"When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp. Ooo! Derp! Derp! O-hoh wasn't that silly kids?"
[OTH],Why did Chef quit?
[OTH],"Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone. Oh, I don't feel so good. Derp!"
[OTH],Could you just hand us some food please?
[OTH],"Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!"
Cartman,Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
[OTH],Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
[OTH],"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back."
Cartman,"I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny."
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman!"
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"Oh! Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today."
[OTH],Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
[OTH],"Yeah, but we didn't believe them."
[OTH],"Well, it's true."
[OTH],But why? Why would you quit?
[OTH],"Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off."
[OTH],So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
[OTH],"No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked."
[OTH],Talked?!
[OTH],"Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself."
[OTH],Oh! What darling little children.
[OTH],"Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica."
[OTH],"That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!"
[OTH],"Children, Veronica is moving in with me."
[OTH],Moving in?!
[OTH],I'm in love.
[OTH],Love?!
[OTH],"Oh, you knight."
[OTH],What the hell is going on?!
[OTH],Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
[OTH],"Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you."
[OTH],"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better."
[OTH],"Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too."
[OTH],What's the problem?
Cartman,"My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean."
[OTH],"Oh, I know just the song for you. There's got to be a morning after
if we can hold on to the night"
[OTH],We have a chance to find the sunshine.
[OTH],Let's keep on looking for the light.
[OTH],"This... is insane. [
""Oh, can't you see the-""

]"
[OTH],That bitch!
[OTH],She's stealing Chef from us.
[OTH],He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
Cartman,Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
[OTH],"Wait you guys. Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new?"
[OTH],"Yeah, so?"
[OTH],"...Yeah, screw that bitch."
Cartman,"Bitch, I hate that bitch!"
[OTH],"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around."
[OTH],Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
[OTH],Good idea.
[OTH],"All right, we got the test results back, piggy-"
Cartman,Stop calling me piggy!
[OTH],You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
Cartman,"So, what does that mean?"
[OTH],"It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better."
Cartman,"All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!"
[OTH],"Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new."
Cartman,"Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me."
[OTH],"I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses."
Cartman,I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
[OTH],That's why we have the little stapler.
Cartman,Ow! Son of a bitch!
[OTH],They said that Chef works in one of these buildings
Cartman,Hey dudes. Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
[OTH],Dude! Just take them off!
Cartman,I can't! They're stapled to my head! I hate you guys.
[OTH],Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?
[OTH],We wanna talk to Chef.
[OTH],Chef?
[OTH],"He's a big guy, with a beard."
[OTH],And a chef hat.
[OTH],{And a real huge dick.}
[OTH],Oh! The black guy!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Third cubicle on the left Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?
Cartman,"Uh, yeah, sure sure."
[OTH],Wow! You really got fat.
Cartman,Ey!
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],"Eric, you got glasses!"
[OTH],"Chef, you have to dump the bitch!"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"We need you, Chef."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?"
[OTH],You bet!
[OTH],"Chef, this place isn't you!"
[OTH],"Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old."
[OTH],But we don't like her.
[OTH],Why not??
[OTH],I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
[OTH],"Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day."
[OTH],"No way, dude!"
Cartman,"Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses."
[OTH],That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
Cartman,Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
[OTH],You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
[OTH],Okay!
[OTH],Chef should be here any minute.
[OTH],Dude! He bailed on us!
[OTH],I can't believe it!
[OTH],Come on! We're going to his house!
[OTH],"Oh! Uh, hello there, children."
[OTH],"All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!"
[OTH],"Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot."
[OTH],You forgot!
[OTH],Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner. She's so amazing.
[OTH],"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!"
[OTH],"Hello, children!"
Cartman,"Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?"
[OTH],"Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married."
[OTH],Oh no! No nononononono!
[OTH],"My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too."
[OTH],This is so wonderful! Let's sing! There's got to be a morning after.
[OTH],If we can hold on through the night. We have a chance to find the sunshine.
[OTH],"And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review. Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant. Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time."
[OTH],"Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so."
[OTH],"All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?"
[OTH],"Oh, the old succubus syndrome."
[OTH],What's a succubus?
[OTH],A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
[OTH],That's it!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love."
[OTH],This is totally what's happening!
[OTH],"Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],"Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say ""get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"""
[OTH],"Thanks, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Sure, kids."
[OTH],You're not fooling anyone!
[OTH],"Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!"
[OTH],Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
[OTH],Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him.
[OTH],"There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor."
Cartman,"Oh, no!"
[OTH],Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
Cartman,"Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow."
[OTH],"Now, hon."
Cartman,But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],I'm Chef's father. We just flew in for the wedding.
[OTH],"Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him."
[OTH],"Well, come on in."
[OTH],There he is!
[OTH],"Chef, we have to talk to you!"
[OTH],"Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back."
[OTH],"Well, aren't you crackers just cute as the dickens?"
[OTH],You're Chef's parents?
[OTH],"Yes, all his life."
[OTH],We have to talk to him!
[OTH],"Well, he should be out now directly."
[OTH],"Oh, he's so excited about the wedding now."
[OTH],"Say, would you crackers like to hear about the time we saw the Loch Ness monster?"
[OTH],"No, that's okay."
[OTH],"Ooh, it must've been about seven, eight years ago. Me and the little lady was out on this boat, you see, all alone at night, when all of a sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the paleolithic era, comes out of the water."
[OTH],"We was so scared, Lord have mercy, I jumped up in the boat and I said ""Thomas, what on earth is that creature?!"""
[OTH],"It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-"
[OTH],"Oh, it was so scary!"
[OTH],"and I yelled. I said, ""What do you want from us, monster?!"" And the monster bent down and said, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty."""
[OTH],What's tree-fitty?
[OTH],Three dollars and fifty cents.
[OTH],Tree-fitty.
[OTH],He wanted money?
[OTH],"That's right. I said ""I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"""
[OTH],I gave him a dollar.
[OTH],She gave him a dollar.
[OTH],I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar.
[OTH],"Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!"
[OTH],"Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right?"
Cartman,Hey! You son of a bitch!
[OTH],All right. Time to laser me a little piggy.
Cartman,"Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh- I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh"
[OTH],I bet his mom wishes she could do that.
[OTH],"And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-"
[OTH],August.
[OTH],"August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-"
[OTH],"And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all."
[OTH],"And she says to me, ""How would you like to buy some cookies?"" And I said ""Well, what kind do you have?"" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-"
[OTH],Raisin oatmeal.
[OTH],"Raisin oatmeal, and I said ""We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?"" And she looks at me and she says, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty."""
[OTH],...Tree-fitty.
[OTH],"Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era."
[OTH],The Loch Ness monster.
[OTH],"I said, ""Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!"" It said, ""how about just two-fitty?"" I said, ""Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!"""
[OTH],"Lord, he was angry."
[OTH],"Damn right, I was angry!"
[OTH],"Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass."
[OTH],"Aah, shut your mouth, woman!"
[OTH],"Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?"
[OTH],"Sure. That crazy old monster Now, then the fourth time I saw the..."
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!"
Cartman,That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
[OTH],"Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman."
Cartman,"Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?"
[OTH],"Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us."
[OTH],"Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right?"
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie."
Cartman,Aaah! It's the succubus!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"We know what you are, lady!"
[OTH],Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
[OTH],A what?
[OTH],A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
[OTH],"Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?"
[OTH],"Well, you are taking Chef from us."
[OTH],"Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand?"
[OTH],I guess.
[OTH],"Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow, And there's not a God-damned thing you can do about it! Toodle-oo!"
[OTH],Jesus dude!
Cartman,What? What happened?
[OTH],"Could I have your attention please? Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady. I'm very happy for them both. Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now."
[OTH],"It's okay, pop."
[OTH],"Thomas, you're gonna get me going now."
[OTH],"Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, ""Poppa, poppa!"" I said ""What do you need, Chef, my boy?"", and he said, ""...I need about tree-fitty."""
[OTH],...Tree-fitty.
[OTH],"Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, ""Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?"" He said, ""My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it."" I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!"
[OTH],"Oh, it was scary!"
[OTH],"I said, ""Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!"""
[OTH],"Excuse me! We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news."
[OTH],This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
[OTH],Children! That hurts my feelings.
[OTH],"Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!"
[OTH],"All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!"
[OTH],"Chef, but-"
[OTH],"No buts, Stan! I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party."
[OTH],"So I chased the monster down the street, you see..."
[OTH],I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
[OTH],No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
[OTH],"Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them."
Cartman,"You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep."
[OTH],Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
Cartman,"You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep."
[OTH],"Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."""
[OTH],What the hell does that mean?
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)"
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)"
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],(That's what that means!)
[OTH],Oh-hoho!
[OTH],"Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? 
There's got to be a morning after."
Cartman,"If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together..."
[OTH],That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
[OTH],In three hours.
[OTH],Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open.
[OTH],"We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song. You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman??"
[OTH],He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
Cartman,What what what?
[OTH],God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
Cartman,"I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!"
[OTH],"...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that."
[OTH],We had taco salad that night.
[OTH],"Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, ""What do you want from me, alien?!"" and do you know what he said?"
[OTH],Tree-fitty.
[OTH],"Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, ""tree-fitty."" And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!"
[OTH],I had just given him tree-fitty the week before.
[OTH],What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
[OTH],He tricked me.
[OTH],Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!
[OTH],There she is!
[OTH],Bitch. Bitch.
[OTH],Bitch.
[OTH],Bitch.
[OTH],Dirty bitch.
[OTH],All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"Do you, Chef, take this woman as your lawful-wedded wife, to have and to-"
[OTH],Iii do!
[OTH],"Aaah, my baby's getting married!"
[OTH],"And do you, Veronica, take Chef to be your daddy?"
[OTH],I do!
[OTH],And now a special sharing of vows through song.
[OTH],Here it goes.
[OTH],There's got to be a morning after.
[OTH],"Now, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Now, Cartman!!"
[OTH],Children! You are screwing up my wedding!
[OTH],I'll take care of them!
[OTH],Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!!
Cartman,Ow!
[OTH],"Light the for looking on keep let's

[OTH],"Hoh, wow! You don't see that every day!"
[OTH],"We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!"
[OTH],"No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her."
[OTH],Poontang's poontang.
[OTH],"Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream."
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef!"
[OTH],How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?
[OTH],We'd love them!
[OTH],It's great to have you back Chef!
[OTH],"Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.And then you're left with nothing, cause your thinking with your dong. So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!Just play it cool and don't be a fool..."
[OTH],And never let poontang come between you and your friend.
[OTH],"Daaamn right, Garrison!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?"
Cartman,"After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!"
[OTH],"I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes."
Cartman,"No, not with my eyes. With these! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
[OTH],Was he an organ donor?
Cartman,Eh-sure.
[OTH],"All right, then let's get to work. Say, you don't have three dollars and fifty cents on you, do you?"
[OTH],"Light the for looking on keep let's

Cartman,"You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"": I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny. I hate him the most."
Cartman,"Okay now, let's try one all together:

I hate you guys.

 Come on, you guys know the words.

Specially Kenny."
[OTH],"This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen. Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,..."
[OTH],Where are you going?
Cartman,I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
[OTH],Just go behind a tree.
Cartman,I have to go number two.
[OTH],So? You can poo in the wilderness.
Cartman,"No way, dude! What would I wipe with?"
[OTH],"Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!"
Cartman,Well what do I sit on?
[OTH],"You just squat, stupid!"
[OTH],Not here! Go further away!
Cartman,"God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules! Urgh. Come on, now."
[OTH],Watch out for ground eels!
Cartman,"Stop, you guys! I can't think!"
[OTH],What do you have to think about?
Cartman,"I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream... Oh, that did it."
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
Cartman,"Poopin' outside, Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.


Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?"
[OTH],(Here you go.) (No way!)
Cartman,What the?
[OTH],Oohma poota!
Cartman,"Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!"
[OTH],"We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!"
Cartman,"You guys, get over here!"
[OTH],"No way, dude!"
Cartman,I'm serious now! Look. Over by those bushes.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Meesa scared!
[OTH],I see it!
Cartman,Come on! Let's kill it!
[OTH],"Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!"
[OTH],Look at this sword. Only on House Shopping Network. It has a dragon on the blade. It's got a dragon painted right on the blade! You should buy the samurai sw-
[OTH],"Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?! I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!"
[OTH],Shut... up... Jimbo.
[OTH],"Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out."
[OTH],I saw it this way!
[OTH],Over here!
Cartman,"Come on, you guys!"
[OTH],What the hell's goin' on?!
[OTH],"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!"
[OTH],"Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on! Where did it go?"
[OTH],It just ran by here a second ago.
[OTH],"Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap! Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready."
[OTH],Ooba jaaga!
[OTH],Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
[OTH],Meesa gonna die? Wooo-wowoop!
Cartman,"Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny."
[OTH],It's stupid.
[OTH],"Well, let's kill it."
Cartman,No! No. Don't.
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,I like it.
[OTH],"You don't like anything, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it."
[OTH],"Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight."
[OTH],"Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie."
[OTH],"Mayor, we're from the Department of Interior."
[OTH],"Ooh, yes. How are you?"
[OTH],"Fine, just fine."
[OTH],"Fine, just fine."
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],Right over here.
[OTH],"My God, McClanahan, do you believe it?"
[OTH],Meesa needa Jakov. Dwooooooo!
[OTH],Mm-it's amazing.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Mayor, this is a jakovasaur. A live one has never been seen."
[OTH],"Oh, neato."
[OTH],Incredible. We know of this creature only from remains frozen in snow.
[OTH],Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
Cartman,Wow! Cool!
[OTH],Is... there... re... ward... money?
[OTH],"Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!"
[OTH],This one jakovasaur can mother an entire population of the animals.
[OTH],"Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope."
[OTH],Hope.
[OTH],"Yes, Hope."
[OTH],Meesa name Junjun.
[OTH],I think his name is Junjun.
[OTH],"Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name!"
[OTH],Now we must find a safe place for it.
[OTH],I'll keep it at my house.
[OTH],"No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!"
[OTH],Uuh?!
[OTH],What?! How dare you say that?!
[OTH],"Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!"
[OTH],"Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut."
[OTH],"Oh, I got a barn it can stay in. It ain't much, but it's heated."
[OTH],"Well, that sounds fine, just fine."
[OTH],"Fine, just fine."
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon? Oh, whatever!"
[OTH],It's got a dragon painted on the blade. This is the Sumatomi sword-
Cartman,"Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??"
[OTH],"I'll think about it, hon."
Cartman,"Sweet. Mom, somebody's at the door."
[OTH],"Mommy's busy, boopie-kins."
Cartman,Should I get it?
[OTH],"Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends."
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],Hmmm.
Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold your horses! God! Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!"
[OTH],"That's nice, muffin."
[OTH],"Please help me. Whoa-oh-oh-oh. Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick."
Cartman,You mean the other jakovasaur?
[OTH],What means a jakovasaur?
Cartman,You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
[OTH],Oh. Cool beans.
Cartman,But the other jakovasaur talked different.
[OTH],That's 'cause Junjun's a girl. Girls talk different.
Cartman,I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
[OTH],Please take me to Junjun. We're the last of our kind. There are only two of us left.
Cartman,"He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left."
[OTH],Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
Cartman,"Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke!"
[OTH],"Eric, do you have any more cookies?"
[OTH],Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
Cartman,"No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in."
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,"Jakov, I want you to meet my friends."
[OTH],"Huhello, guys. I love new friends."
Cartman,"Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?"
[OTH],"No, he's annoying."
[OTH],What are we supposed to do with him?
Cartman,We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
[OTH],Why don't we just tell our parents?
Cartman,No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
[OTH],Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here.
[OTH],Junjun!
[OTH],"Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!"
[OTH],"Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay!"
[OTH],"Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!"
[OTH],I am whispering! Yyeow!
Cartman,"Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov."
[OTH],I am?
[OTH],"Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?"
[OTH],"Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond."
[OTH],"Aw, we's in big doodoo now."
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],"Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?"
[OTH],"Yes... Hello..., um..., I... lost... my... voice... box…"
[OTH],Excuse me?
[OTH],I... lost... my... voice... box…
[OTH],Excuse me?
[OTH],I... lost... my... voice... box...
[OTH],"Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box! You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go. Well, try it out!"
[OTH],"Mmm. Aw, Jimbo, I can't thank you enough for the new voice box. Gmmm, now, what in the devil is this thing?"
[OTH],"Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake."
[OTH],"Mmm-aw, what a bloody pickle this is! Did you keep the receipt, then?"
[OTH],You guys come quick! I've only just heard!
[OTH],What? What is it?
[OTH],They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur!
[OTH],"Gmmm, blimey."
[OTH],Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
[OTH],"Thank you, Mayor. The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back."
Cartman,"""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."""
[OTH],"What are you doing, fatass?!"
Cartman,"I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."""
[OTH],"...Hope and Jakov are the last of their kind. But with the help of the Mayor, we have implemented a plan to help them breed. We will give them a home and a fighting chance at survival."
[OTH],Yea for us!
[OTH],Thank you!
[OTH],"And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!"
Cartman,"Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction."
[OTH],"Well, that's about it. Let's go."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me... Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!"
[OTH],Wow!! It's so pretty!
[OTH],"Well, Jakov, we hope this new home ""inspires"" you and Hope to uh, hm, you know..."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Well, we'd love to see more jakovasaurs, so, maybe you two should uuh…"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Get to some business.
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!"
[OTH],Ooohh.
[OTH],We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone.
[OTH],"Well, all right, then."
[OTH],Meesa just don't wanna!
[OTH],I don't know what to do!
[OTH],"Jakov, to have sex, all you need to do is, well, you know, put your... Hmmm. I guess we don't know exactly how jakovasaurs mate."
[OTH],There is... another option.
[OTH],I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen.
[OTH],I have seamen? Where's their boat? Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!
[OTH],"Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov. I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked."
[OTH],Oh-wwoooooop! Oh-wwoooooop!
[OTH],Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!
[OTH],God-damn!
[OTH],Shut up!!
[OTH],"Yes! Yes, I think it worked! You are going to be parents!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],We did it!
[OTH],Now I can be like all the other guys in South Park!
[OTH],"Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?"
[OTH],"...and Bubby Brister is having a great first quarter! Let's see what trickery he uses here. Here's the snap, and he's down-"
[OTH],"Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys!"
[OTH],"No problem, Jakov."
[OTH],To the 40-yard line!
[OTH],Yea!
[OTH],Go Niners! Ni-ners!
[OTH],"We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!"
[OTH],Oooops!
[OTH],"...to Terrell Davis! He's at the 50, the 40, the 30,..."
[OTH],"You guys know what? This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit-"
[OTH],"He breaks another tackle, and the ball is loose!"
[OTH],You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.
[OTH],"Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?"
[OTH],Sure. You got money?
[OTH],Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
[OTH],Cool beans. Oopsie. I'll be right back.
[OTH],"Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay."
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Amazing! The gestation period was only four days.
[OTH],"At that rate, we could repopulate the jakovasaurs in just a few years."
[OTH],Doe-wooop!
[OTH],"Don't worry, Hope. Everything's gonna be fine, just fine."
[OTH],Just fine.
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby."
Cartman,"If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct."
[OTH],"Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was."
Cartman,"Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!"
[OTH],Here we go.
[OTH],Doe-woooop!
[OTH],"Behold, the miracle of childbirth!"
[OTH],Dowoop!
[OTH],Gross!
[OTH],Dowoop!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],This is the first step in bringing the species back from the brink of extinction!
[OTH],Dowoooop! Dowoop!
[OTH],Looks like there might be a second one.
[OTH],Wow! That would be a great start for them.
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],She's a cannon!
[OTH],"Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters."
Cartman,"Aren't they cute, you guys?"
[OTH],Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
[OTH],Huh-owhoa-o-woop!
[OTH],Huh?! Whoa-o-whoa!
[OTH],"Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class."
[OTH],"Dude, it's crowded in here."
[OTH],I like school!
[OTH],Bo-woop!
[OTH],"O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history. Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972? Yes?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],Bo-woop!
[OTH],"O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?"
[OTH],I can't.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],"Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],O-wowo-oop! O-woo-oop!
[OTH],Ooo! Fight! Fight!
[OTH],"School, school! I like school!"
[OTH],"School, school! I like school!
School, school! I like school!"
[OTH],"Dude, this sucks ass!"
Cartman,I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool.
[OTH],"This is insane, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"It sure is, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!"
[OTH],"Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Totally!
[OTH],"And they're creating more trash than we can handle, too!"
[OTH],Totally!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Listen to her!
[OTH],"And what about little Laura, the Williams' kid? If she doesn't get that heart-valve operation, she could die. Yeah! Yeah, that's right!"
[OTH],"All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave."
[OTH],We just encourage them to find someplace better.
[OTH],"But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?"
[OTH],Memphis?
[OTH],"Yes, Memphis. You jakovasaurs would love it there."
[OTH],"I don't know. I like South Park a lot. What do you think, honey?"
[OTH],G'ooh-woo-ooop!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right?
[OTH],"Okay, we'll move to Memphis!"
[OTH],Yea!
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,"Hey, Jakov, how's it going?"
[OTH],"Great, Eric! We're moving."
Cartman,Moving?
[OTH],"Me, Jun and the family are heading to the Promised Land of Memphis."
Cartman,You... can't leave. You're my friend.
[OTH],"Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best."
[OTH],Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed!
Cartman,"Jakov, please don't go. You make everything in South Park fun. You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you."
[OTH],It would?
Cartman,"Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?"
[OTH],O-kay. I like South Park best of all. We're staying!
Cartman,"Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys!"
[OTH],Now what do we do?
[OTH],"Don't worry, We've come up with a plan."
[OTH],You have?
[OTH],Yes. We're leaving.
[OTH],What??
[OTH],We're getting the hell out of here and away from those God-damned things.
[OTH],You can't leave.
Cartman,Yes. Who would take care of them?
[OTH],"Little boy, we're making you an honorary Department of Interior person. So now, you are officially in charge of South Park's fish and wildlife. You have authority over all of them."
Cartman,I have authoriteh?
[OTH],That's right. And people must respect it.
Cartman,"Well, that should be fine, just fine."
[OTH],"Fine, just fine."
Cartman,Fine.
[OTH],"Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!"
[OTH],"Bye-bye, now."
[OTH],And now back to... Jakovasaurs! on Comedy Central.
[OTH],"Hi, honey! I'm home! Wooooo! Boy, it was rough at work today. I've never seen so much coffee."
[OTH],Booo-wooop?
[OTH],"No, in the boss's lap."
[OTH],"Hello, dad."
[OTH],"Hello, son. How was your day?"
[OTH],"Oh, not so good. Something really strange happened."
[OTH],What? You mean MTV played a video that wasn't Will Smith?
[OTH],"Noho, dad. A man in a blue suit and a bag came to the door. He just left this li'l piece of paper with a stamp on it."
[OTH],That's called a mailman. He takes care of mail.
[OTH],"Oh! He took care of mom, too."
[OTH],You're a nut! Let me see that letter. It's from a game show. The Mayor has invited me to compete.
Cartman,"Hi, Jakov. What the hell is that? Who's laughing?"
[OTH],"Eric! The Mayor has invited us to compete on a game show in South Park! Big prizes, an all-expense paid vacation-"
Cartman,"Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready."
[OTH],"Woo, woo!"
[OTH],"Come onn, come on! Hello!"
[OTH],Mayor? This is Jakov. I'm the tall fellow down the block from-
[OTH],"Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!"
[OTH],"Sure! If a free trip is involved, can my whole family go?"
[OTH],"Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!!"
[OTH],Cool beans!!
[OTH],"We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?"
[OTH],Break!
[OTH],"Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express."
[OTH],"Oh... boy..., oh... boy."
[OTH],"Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!"
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs! Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France! And, all one of you lucky contestants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?"
[OTH],Ready.
[OTH],Ready.
[OTH],Okay. Hands on your buzzers.
[OTH],Forty-seven!
[OTH],You have to wait until I ask the question first.
[OTH],Sor-ry!
[OTH],That's okay. Hands on buzzers.
[OTH],Turkey sandwich!
[OTH],"Damn, he's quick!"
[OTH],Oh. Sor-ry!
[OTH],"No, I'm sorry."
[OTH],"No, it's my fault. I'm sorry."
[OTH],"No, it's all me. Uh, my bad."
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?!
[OTH],Got it!
[OTH],"Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue?"
[OTH],Blue?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Uh. Blue is blue?
[OTH],"Awww, did I lose?"
[OTH],"What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on. You're supposed to lose, you idiot!"
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],"Just don't answer any more questions, got it?"
[OTH],Okie-dokie.
[OTH],"Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!"
Cartman,"What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show."
[OTH],"Oh, he'll win. Don't worry."
[OTH],"We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears."
Cartman,"Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species. Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine."
[OTH],There it is! That must be of the antelope family.
Cartman,"That's Kenny with branches on his head. Why did you bring me all the way out here, you guys?"
[OTH],"Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that."
Cartman,"Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix!"
[OTH],Cartman! Wait!
[OTH],"(Hey you guys, wait up for me!) (Waaah!)"
[OTH],"What's two plus two, Jakov?"
[OTH],I don't know!
[OTH],Four?
[OTH],"Jakov, what is your name?"
[OTH],Jakov
[OTH],"Oh, screw it. Jakov wins!"
[OTH],I do?
[OTH],You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport! Let's go, people! There's no time to lose!"
[OTH],But what about our clothes? Shouldn't we pack first?
[OTH],"Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov."
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Well, good-bye everybody! We'll send stuff from France!"
[OTH],Good-bye!
[OTH],Werrr.
Cartman,Jakov!
[OTH],Close the door!
Cartman,Open this door!
[OTH],"Eric, this is for the best."
Cartman,"I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah! No! Jakov, don't go!"
[OTH],"Hi, Eric! Okay, bye, then!"
Cartman,Come... back.
[OTH],"Eric, it's important for you to understand-."
Cartman,"Don't, mother! Just, don't."
[OTH],"I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution."
[OTH],The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
[OTH],"We can't go around saving every form of life, any more than we can kill them all. We have to let nature run its course."
[OTH],"Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!"
[OTH],I know. I'm still trying to find my old one.
[OTH],"Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!"
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,No. That's okay. I'll see you guys.
[OTH],Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
[OTH],Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
[OTH],Bonjour.
[OTH],Bonjour.
[OTH],Café?
[OTH],Oui.
[OTH],"Come on, kids! Let's go find some pyramids! Woops! Aaaah!"
[OTH],C'est drôle et amusant (That was SO FUNNY!!)
[OTH],(I love its antics!!!)
[OTH],Il est si comme Jerry Lewis!!! (He's just like Jerry Lewis!!!)
Cartman,"You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"": I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny. I hate him the most."
Cartman,"Okay now, let's try one all together:

I hate you guys.

 Come on, you guys know the words.

Specially Kenny."
[OTH],"This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen. Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,..."
[OTH],Where are you going?
Cartman,I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
[OTH],Just go behind a tree.
Cartman,I have to go number two.
[OTH],So? You can poo in the wilderness.
Cartman,"No way, dude! What would I wipe with?"
[OTH],"Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!"
Cartman,Well what do I sit on?
[OTH],"You just squat, stupid!"
[OTH],Not here! Go further away!
Cartman,"God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules! Urgh. Come on, now."
[OTH],Watch out for ground eels!
Cartman,"Stop, you guys! I can't think!"
[OTH],What do you have to think about?
Cartman,"I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream... Oh, that did it."
[OTH],"Sick, dude!"
Cartman,"Poopin' outside, Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.


Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?"
[OTH],(Here you go.) (No way!)
Cartman,What the?
[OTH],Oohma poota!
Cartman,"Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!"
[OTH],"We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!"
Cartman,"You guys, get over here!"
[OTH],"No way, dude!"
Cartman,I'm serious now! Look. Over by those bushes.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Meesa scared!
[OTH],I see it!
Cartman,Come on! Let's kill it!
[OTH],"Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!"
[OTH],Look at this sword. Only on House Shopping Network. It has a dragon on the blade. It's got a dragon painted right on the blade! You should buy the samurai sw-
[OTH],"Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?! I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!"
[OTH],Shut... up... Jimbo.
[OTH],"Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out."
[OTH],I saw it this way!
[OTH],Over here!
Cartman,"Come on, you guys!"
[OTH],What the hell's goin' on?!
[OTH],"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!"
[OTH],"Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on! Where did it go?"
[OTH],It just ran by here a second ago.
[OTH],"Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap! Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready."
[OTH],Ooba jaaga!
[OTH],Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
[OTH],Meesa gonna die? Wooo-wowoop!
Cartman,"Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny."
[OTH],It's stupid.
[OTH],"Well, let's kill it."
Cartman,No! No. Don't.
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,I like it.
[OTH],"You don't like anything, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it."
[OTH],"Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight."
[OTH],"Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie."
[OTH],"Mayor, we're from the Department of Interior."
[OTH],"Ooh, yes. How are you?"
[OTH],"Fine, just fine."
[OTH],"Fine, just fine."
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],Right over here.
[OTH],"My God, McClanahan, do you believe it?"
[OTH],Meesa needa Jakov. Dwooooooo!
[OTH],Mm-it's amazing.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Mayor, this is a jakovasaur. A live one has never been seen."
[OTH],"Oh, neato."
[OTH],Incredible. We know of this creature only from remains frozen in snow.
[OTH],Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
Cartman,Wow! Cool!
[OTH],Is... there... re... ward... money?
[OTH],"Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!"
[OTH],This one jakovasaur can mother an entire population of the animals.
[OTH],"Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope."
[OTH],Hope.
[OTH],"Yes, Hope."
[OTH],Meesa name Junjun.
[OTH],I think his name is Junjun.
[OTH],"Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name!"
[OTH],Now we must find a safe place for it.
[OTH],I'll keep it at my house.
[OTH],"No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!"
[OTH],Uuh?!
[OTH],What?! How dare you say that?!
[OTH],"Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!"
[OTH],"Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut."
[OTH],"Oh, I got a barn it can stay in. It ain't much, but it's heated."
[OTH],"Well, that sounds fine, just fine."
[OTH],"Fine, just fine."
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon? Oh, whatever!"
[OTH],It's got a dragon painted on the blade. This is the Sumatomi sword-
Cartman,"Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??"
[OTH],"I'll think about it, hon."
Cartman,"Sweet. Mom, somebody's at the door."
[OTH],"Mommy's busy, boopie-kins."
Cartman,Should I get it?
[OTH],"Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends."
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],Hmmm.
Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold your horses! God! Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!"
[OTH],"That's nice, muffin."
[OTH],"Please help me. Whoa-oh-oh-oh. Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick."
Cartman,You mean the other jakovasaur?
[OTH],What means a jakovasaur?
Cartman,You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
[OTH],Oh. Cool beans.
Cartman,But the other jakovasaur talked different.
[OTH],That's 'cause Junjun's a girl. Girls talk different.
Cartman,I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
[OTH],Please take me to Junjun. We're the last of our kind. There are only two of us left.
Cartman,"He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left."
[OTH],Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
Cartman,"Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke!"
[OTH],"Eric, do you have any more cookies?"
[OTH],Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
Cartman,"No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in."
[OTH],Wow!
Cartman,"Jakov, I want you to meet my friends."
[OTH],"Huhello, guys. I love new friends."
Cartman,"Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?"
[OTH],"No, he's annoying."
[OTH],What are we supposed to do with him?
Cartman,We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
[OTH],Why don't we just tell our parents?
Cartman,No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
[OTH],Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here.
[OTH],Junjun!
[OTH],"Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!"
[OTH],"Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay!"
[OTH],"Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!"
[OTH],I am whispering! Yyeow!
Cartman,"Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov."
[OTH],I am?
[OTH],"Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?"
[OTH],"Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond."
[OTH],"Aw, we's in big doodoo now."
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],"Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?"
[OTH],"Yes... Hello..., um..., I... lost... my... voice... box…"
[OTH],Excuse me?
[OTH],I... lost... my... voice... box…
[OTH],Excuse me?
[OTH],I... lost... my... voice... box...
[OTH],"Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box! You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go. Well, try it out!"
[OTH],"Mmm. Aw, Jimbo, I can't thank you enough for the new voice box. Gmmm, now, what in the devil is this thing?"
[OTH],"Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake."
[OTH],"Mmm-aw, what a bloody pickle this is! Did you keep the receipt, then?"
[OTH],You guys come quick! I've only just heard!
[OTH],What? What is it?
[OTH],They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur!
[OTH],"Gmmm, blimey."
[OTH],Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
[OTH],"Thank you, Mayor. The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back."
Cartman,"""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."""
[OTH],"What are you doing, fatass?!"
Cartman,"I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."""
[OTH],"...Hope and Jakov are the last of their kind. But with the help of the Mayor, we have implemented a plan to help them breed. We will give them a home and a fighting chance at survival."
[OTH],Yea for us!
[OTH],Thank you!
[OTH],"And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!"
Cartman,"Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction."
[OTH],"Well, that's about it. Let's go."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me... Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!"
[OTH],Wow!! It's so pretty!
[OTH],"Well, Jakov, we hope this new home ""inspires"" you and Hope to uh, hm, you know..."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Well, we'd love to see more jakovasaurs, so, maybe you two should uuh…"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Get to some business.
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!"
[OTH],Ooohh.
[OTH],We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone.
[OTH],"Well, all right, then."
[OTH],Meesa just don't wanna!
[OTH],I don't know what to do!
[OTH],"Jakov, to have sex, all you need to do is, well, you know, put your... Hmmm. I guess we don't know exactly how jakovasaurs mate."
[OTH],There is... another option.
[OTH],I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen.
[OTH],I have seamen? Where's their boat? Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!
[OTH],"Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov. I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked."
[OTH],Oh-wwoooooop! Oh-wwoooooop!
[OTH],Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!
[OTH],God-damn!
[OTH],Shut up!!
[OTH],"Yes! Yes, I think it worked! You are going to be parents!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],We did it!
[OTH],Now I can be like all the other guys in South Park!
[OTH],"Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?"
[OTH],"...and Bubby Brister is having a great first quarter! Let's see what trickery he uses here. Here's the snap, and he's down-"
[OTH],"Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys!"
[OTH],"No problem, Jakov."
[OTH],To the 40-yard line!
[OTH],Yea!
[OTH],Go Niners! Ni-ners!
[OTH],"We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!"
[OTH],Oooops!
[OTH],"...to Terrell Davis! He's at the 50, the 40, the 30,..."
[OTH],"You guys know what? This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit-"
[OTH],"He breaks another tackle, and the ball is loose!"
[OTH],You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.
[OTH],"Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?"
[OTH],Sure. You got money?
[OTH],Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
[OTH],Cool beans. Oopsie. I'll be right back.
[OTH],"Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay."
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Amazing! The gestation period was only four days.
[OTH],"At that rate, we could repopulate the jakovasaurs in just a few years."
[OTH],Doe-wooop!
[OTH],"Don't worry, Hope. Everything's gonna be fine, just fine."
[OTH],Just fine.
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby."
Cartman,"If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct."
[OTH],"Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was."
Cartman,"Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!"
[OTH],Here we go.
[OTH],Doe-woooop!
[OTH],"Behold, the miracle of childbirth!"
[OTH],Dowoop!
[OTH],Gross!
[OTH],Dowoop!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],This is the first step in bringing the species back from the brink of extinction!
[OTH],Dowoooop! Dowoop!
[OTH],Looks like there might be a second one.
[OTH],Wow! That would be a great start for them.
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],She's a cannon!
[OTH],"Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters."
Cartman,"Aren't they cute, you guys?"
[OTH],Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
[OTH],Huh-owhoa-o-woop!
[OTH],Huh?! Whoa-o-whoa!
[OTH],"Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class."
[OTH],"Dude, it's crowded in here."
[OTH],I like school!
[OTH],Bo-woop!
[OTH],"O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history. Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972? Yes?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],Bo-woop!
[OTH],"O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?"
[OTH],I can't.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],"Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!"
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],O-wowo-oop! O-woo-oop!
[OTH],Ooo! Fight! Fight!
[OTH],"School, school! I like school!"
[OTH],"School, school! I like school!
School, school! I like school!"
[OTH],"Dude, this sucks ass!"
Cartman,I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool.
[OTH],"This is insane, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"It sure is, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!"
[OTH],"Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Totally!
[OTH],"And they're creating more trash than we can handle, too!"
[OTH],Totally!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Listen to her!
[OTH],"And what about little Laura, the Williams' kid? If she doesn't get that heart-valve operation, she could die. Yeah! Yeah, that's right!"
[OTH],"All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave."
[OTH],We just encourage them to find someplace better.
[OTH],"But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?"
[OTH],Memphis?
[OTH],"Yes, Memphis. You jakovasaurs would love it there."
[OTH],"I don't know. I like South Park a lot. What do you think, honey?"
[OTH],G'ooh-woo-ooop!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right?
[OTH],"Okay, we'll move to Memphis!"
[OTH],Yea!
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,"Hey, Jakov, how's it going?"
[OTH],"Great, Eric! We're moving."
Cartman,Moving?
[OTH],"Me, Jun and the family are heading to the Promised Land of Memphis."
Cartman,You... can't leave. You're my friend.
[OTH],"Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best."
[OTH],Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed!
Cartman,"Jakov, please don't go. You make everything in South Park fun. You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you."
[OTH],It would?
Cartman,"Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?"
[OTH],O-kay. I like South Park best of all. We're staying!
Cartman,"Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys!"
[OTH],Now what do we do?
[OTH],"Don't worry, We've come up with a plan."
[OTH],You have?
[OTH],Yes. We're leaving.
[OTH],What??
[OTH],We're getting the hell out of here and away from those God-damned things.
[OTH],You can't leave.
Cartman,Yes. Who would take care of them?
[OTH],"Little boy, we're making you an honorary Department of Interior person. So now, you are officially in charge of South Park's fish and wildlife. You have authority over all of them."
Cartman,I have authoriteh?
[OTH],That's right. And people must respect it.
Cartman,"Well, that should be fine, just fine."
[OTH],"Fine, just fine."
Cartman,Fine.
[OTH],"Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!"
[OTH],"Bye-bye, now."
[OTH],And now back to... Jakovasaurs! on Comedy Central.
[OTH],"Hi, honey! I'm home! Wooooo! Boy, it was rough at work today. I've never seen so much coffee."
[OTH],Booo-wooop?
[OTH],"No, in the boss's lap."
[OTH],"Hello, dad."
[OTH],"Hello, son. How was your day?"
[OTH],"Oh, not so good. Something really strange happened."
[OTH],What? You mean MTV played a video that wasn't Will Smith?
[OTH],"Noho, dad. A man in a blue suit and a bag came to the door. He just left this li'l piece of paper with a stamp on it."
[OTH],That's called a mailman. He takes care of mail.
[OTH],"Oh! He took care of mom, too."
[OTH],You're a nut! Let me see that letter. It's from a game show. The Mayor has invited me to compete.
Cartman,"Hi, Jakov. What the hell is that? Who's laughing?"
[OTH],"Eric! The Mayor has invited us to compete on a game show in South Park! Big prizes, an all-expense paid vacation-"
Cartman,"Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready."

[OTH],"Come onn, come on! Hello!"

[OTH],"Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!"
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs! Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France! And, all one of you lucky contestants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?"
[OTH],Ready.
[OTH],Ready.
[OTH],Okay. Hands on your buzzers.

[OTH],You have to wait until I ask the question first.

[OTH],Turkey sandwich!
[OTH],"Damn, he's quick!"
[OTH],Oh. Sor-ry!
[OTH],"No, I'm sorry."
[OTH],"No, it's my fault. I'm sorry."
[OTH],"No, it's all me. Uh, my bad."
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],Sorry.
[OTH],Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?!
[OTH],Got it!
[OTH],"Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue?"
[OTH],Blue?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Uh. Blue is blue?
[OTH],"Awww, did I lose?"
[OTH],"What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on. You're supposed to lose, you idiot!"
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],"Just don't answer any more questions, got it?"
[OTH],Okie-dokie.
[OTH],"Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!"
Cartman,"What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show."
[OTH],"Oh, he'll win. Don't worry."
[OTH],"We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears."
Cartman,"Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species. Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine."
[OTH],There it is! That must be of the antelope family.
Cartman,"That's Kenny with branches on his head. Why did you bring me all the way out here, you guys?"
[OTH],"Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that."
Cartman,"Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix!"
[OTH],Cartman! Wait!
[OTH],"(Hey you guys, wait up for me!) (Waaah!)"
[OTH],"What's two plus two, Jakov?"
[OTH],I don't know!
[OTH],Four?
[OTH],"Jakov, what is your name?"
[OTH],Jakov
[OTH],"Oh, screw it. Jakov wins!"
[OTH],I do?
[OTH],You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport! Let's go, people! There's no time to lose!"
[OTH],But what about our clothes? Shouldn't we pack first?
[OTH],"Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov."
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Well, good-bye everybody! We'll send stuff from France!"
[OTH],Good-bye!
[OTH],Werrr.
Cartman,Jakov!
[OTH],Close the door!
Cartman,Open this door!
[OTH],"Eric, this is for the best."
Cartman,"I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah! No! Jakov, don't go!"
[OTH],"Hi, Eric! Okay, bye, then!"
Cartman,Come... back.
[OTH],"Eric, it's important for you to understand-."
Cartman,"Don't, mother! Just, don't."
[OTH],"I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution."
[OTH],The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
[OTH],"We can't go around saving every form of life, any more than we can kill them all. We have to let nature run its course."
[OTH],"Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!"
[OTH],I know. I'm still trying to find my old one.
[OTH],"Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!"
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,No. That's okay. I'll see you guys.
[OTH],Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
[OTH],Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
[OTH],Bonjour.
[OTH],Bonjour.
[OTH],Café?
[OTH],Oui.
[OTH],"Come on, kids! Let's go find some pyramids! Woops! Aaaah!"
[OTH],C'est drôle et amusant (That was SO FUNNY!!)
[OTH],(I love its antics!!!)
[OTH],Il est si comme Jerry Lewis!!! (He's just like Jerry Lewis!!!)
[OTH],"This is shop class. My name is Mr. Adler. For the next week, rather than your normal schoolwork, you'll be learning how to make things. Now, does anybody know WHY you're in shop class? Yes?"
[OTH],"Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?"
[OTH],"Wrong! You are here because you are America's future! You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have... shop class."
Cartman,Ooooohh.
[OTH],"Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a- I have... uh, I have a..."
[OTH],Mr. Adler?
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?"
[OTH],Tweek is!
[OTH],"Arrh! No, I'm not!"
[OTH],"Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble."
[OTH],Arrrrh!
Cartman,"Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class."
[OTH],"That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we- Hey! Did you just flip me off?!"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Yes, you did!"
Cartman,Told ya!
[OTH],"Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec."
[OTH],"Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls."
[OTH],"Welcome to home ec. For the next week, you will be learning how to bake, sew, clean, and make things that are lacy and pretty."
[OTH],(Woohooo!)
[OTH],"I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here."
[OTH],"That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers. But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec."
[OTH],(Woohooo!)
Cartman,I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class?
[OTH],I don't know. He's such a wuss.
[OTH],Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
Cartman,"You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is."
[OTH],No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
Cartman,"Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass."
[OTH],Do you wanna bet?
Cartman,"Yeah, I'll bet."
[OTH],How much?
Cartman,Five bucks.
[OTH],You're on!
[OTH],Arrh!
[OTH],Hey Tweek.
[OTH],Gaarhrhrh!
[OTH],Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
[OTH],He does?
[OTH],"Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him?"
[OTH],Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
Cartman,"Craig, could I talk to you real quick? Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater."
[OTH],He did?
Cartman,"Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it."
[OTH],Why would he say that?
Cartman,"I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you."
[OTH],"Well, I've gotta go over there and-"
Cartman,"No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
[OTH],Rrrr! What a jerk!
[OTH],"He's really got it out for you, dude."
[OTH],Why?! What did I do?!
[OTH],"So, do you agree to fight him after school?"
[OTH],I guess so.
[OTH],Super. See you there.
[OTH],"Catch me, Richard. I'm so in love with you, Richard. I made you some cookies, Richard. Merry Christmas, Richard. Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. Aaaaaaa! Richard!"
[OTH],Aaaarr! Uh. Oh why? Why?
[OTH],Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
[OTH],Huh? Stop screwing around!
[OTH],The bell rang. Can we go?
[OTH],"Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed."
[OTH],"Come on, you guys."
[OTH],"This is gonna be so sweet, dude."
Cartman,You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
[OTH],We'll see!
Cartman,Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
[OTH],"You're on, fatass!"
Cartman,"Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!"
[OTH],"(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)"
[OTH],"How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?"
[OTH],"Yeah. That's not cool, dude."
[OTH],"Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow."
[OTH],"Bye, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Bye, ladies.)"
[OTH],"Hey, what's going on?"
[OTH],Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
[OTH],"Really? Cool. It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Yeah, they left."
[OTH],"Aw, hell!"
Cartman,Those sons of bitches!
[OTH],I guess they don't wanna fight.
[OTH],"Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet!"
[OTH],Tweek?
[OTH],Tweek?
[OTH],Arrh! What do you guys want?
[OTH],"How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!"
[OTH],Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
[OTH],"Well, Craig showed up."
[OTH],He did?
[OTH],"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"""
[OTH],I don't have crooked teeth!
[OTH],"And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken; well, everybody in the world saw it!"
[OTH],Everyone in the world?! Rrrr!
[OTH],"Yeah, it was weak."
[OTH],I'm not a chicken!
[OTH],"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya."
[OTH],Wait! I'll fight!
[OTH],Tomorrow?
[OTH],Okay.
Cartman,"Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!"
[OTH],Red Racer's on.
Cartman,"Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!"
[OTH],I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
Cartman,"Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom."
[OTH],Nope.
Cartman,"Egh. God damn it! Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig."
[OTH],What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
Cartman,"Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed."
[OTH],"That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!"
Cartman,"Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?"
[OTH],After Red Racer.
Cartman,"After Red Racer, of course."
[OTH],"How was school today, son?"
[OTH],Errh!
[OTH],That's great.
[OTH],"Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??"
[OTH],"Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met. You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive."
[OTH],It's true. I was.
[OTH],"Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight."
[OTH],Well?
[OTH],"Well what, honey?"
[OTH],Nrr. What happened?
[OTH],"Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something."
[OTH],"Yes, I think that's right."
[OTH],Rrrrr! You guys never help me! Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out!
[OTH],"Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow."
[OTH],With who?
[OTH],Some kid.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Don't just ""Oh"" him, Thomas!"
[OTH],"Yeah, don't just ""Oh"" me!"
[OTH],"I'll ""Oh"" whoever I want!"
[OTH],"Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later."
[OTH],"Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight."
[OTH],"Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on."
[OTH],"Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?"
[OTH],"I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts."
[OTH],We'll use plastic wrap.
[OTH],Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time.
[OTH],"Swing me Richard, swing me higher. I wanna touch the sky, Richard. Richard, I'm here! Smile. Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's what I do! Aaaaaaa! Richard! Richard."
[OTH],"Haaarrr! Aw, God, what am I gonna do?"
[OTH],"Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45."
[OTH],"Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?"
[OTH],I uh...
Cartman,"However long Craig wants it to last. T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge."
[OTH],He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
Cartman,Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass!!"
Cartman,"Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight."
[OTH],"On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes. When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE. It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy. The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two."
[OTH],"What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?"
[OTH],Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats.
Cartman,"When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world."
[OTH],"That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!"
Cartman,"Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000."
[OTH],"Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing!"
[OTH],"Ri-chard! Ri-chard! Swing me Richard, swing me higher! Richard, I'm here! Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's all for you! Aaaaaaa! Richard!"
[OTH],Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!
[OTH],"Huh? Uh, what?"
[OTH],Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander
[OTH],"The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I? Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago."
[OTH],What? She die or something?
[OTH],What? Hey! Go on! You're screwing around in here!
[OTH],Oh boy! Here we go!
[OTH],What's happening?
[OTH],Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
[OTH],Oh cool!
[OTH],"Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed. All right. Here we go."
[OTH],"Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy."
Cartman,"You're gonna be eating those words, asshole."
[OTH],"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby."
[OTH],Well?
Cartman,Come on!
[OTH],"Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!"
[OTH],What do we do?
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other."
[OTH],How?
[OTH],How??
[OTH],I've never been in a fight before.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],Awwww.
[OTH],"Aw, dude, come on!!"
Cartman,"You just hit each other, smack each other around."
[OTH],Not like that!
[OTH],"Like what, then?"
[OTH],"All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],All that build-up for nothing.
[OTH],"Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!"
[OTH],"All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig."
Cartman,"I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek."
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!"
Cartman,"Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys! I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!"
[OTH],Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
Cartman,Fine!
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,"Fine, that's fine!"
[OTH],"Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing."
[OTH],Rrrrh!
[OTH],You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
[OTH],Mmrr I can still kick ass.
[OTH],"Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you."
[OTH],Hwaaah!
[OTH],"Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing."
[OTH],Uugh!
[OTH],"Mmm whatcha got, bee-ahtch?"
[OTH],"Keep your guard up, Tweek!"
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],"Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!"
[OTH],"All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here."
[OTH],"Gmmmmm, whatcha got, bee-ahtch?"
[OTH],"Punch him in the balls, Tweek!!"
[OTH],AAAAaaaarrgh.
[OTH],"Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down!"
[OTH],Ow.
[OTH],"Good! Now kick his balls! There, see? You've got him coughing up blood."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Rrrr!
[OTH],Now THAT'S BOXING!
[OTH],"Your friend hasa brought you to learn the ancient art ofa sumo. You must learna discipline anda respect. In sumo, your body must be rike a stone, and your mind rike a meatroaf."
[OTH],Meatloaf?
[OTH],The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?
Cartman,"I'm ready! Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool."
[OTH],"Let us begin. Ready? And, th-ree."
Cartman,Respect my authoritah!
[OTH],Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!
Cartman,"Dude. Come on, now. Come on."
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!"
[OTH],Fight back! Resist the ass!
[OTH],How can I resist an ass so great?
[OTH],It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind.
[OTH],"This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master."
Cartman,I win!
[OTH],"There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession."
Cartman,"Hey, maybe."
[OTH],No. No. Make it stop.
[OTH],"Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. Don't worry, Richard. I'm a pilot! Watch me, Richard! Richard!"
[OTH],Baaaaa! I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye! Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?!
[OTH],"Okay, that was very good, class. Now let's try this one together. Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"
[OTH],"Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"
[OTH],"All right, now let's try this one together. Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car...."
[OTH],Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
[OTH],"Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one. I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life."
[OTH],I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
[OTH],"Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try? I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed."
[OTH],(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
[OTH],"O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick?"
[OTH],(Sure you can.)
[OTH],"Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you."
[OTH],(Why?)
[OTH],"Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good."
[OTH],(You don't?)
[OTH],No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class.
[OTH],"(Shop class?) (No, I won't!)"
[OTH],"Now, now. Very few students are severely injured in a shop class."
[OTH],(I don't wanna take shop class!)
[OTH],Come on! It's time for the fight!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you anything?"
[OTH],"Okay, the time has finally come."
[OTH],"Programs, get your programs here. Programs."
[OTH],"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low."
[OTH],Hrrr.
[OTH],"This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek."
[OTH],"Rrrr, mean, rrrr."
Cartman,The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
[OTH],Okay.
Cartman,"Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!"
[OTH],"Okay, okay!"
[OTH],Rrrr! Hr.
[OTH],You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
[OTH],Respect my authority.
[OTH],"Come on, Tweek!"
Cartman,"Come on, Craig!"
[OTH],"To whom it may concern: I can no longer live without her. I couldn't say goodbye to her, and so now I must say goodbye to all of you, for I am all out of nicotine gum.Sincerely yours,
Richard Adler
Shop Class
P.S. Don't screw around. You all screw around too much."
[OTH],"Good-bye, cruel world. Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell!"
[OTH],Ye-hah!
Cartman,"Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass!"
[OTH],"Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!"
Cartman,"Come on, Craig!"
[OTH],"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
[OTH],"Get him! Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Craig just called you a boner!
[OTH],Rrrr!
[OTH],We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"(Hi, Mr. Adler.)"
[OTH],"What? Who are you? ""Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class."" Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there. Hrh."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],What the-?
[OTH],Here they are.
[OTH],Hey! What's going on?
[OTH],Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching.
[OTH],"Well, why the hell don't you stop them?"
Cartman,'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
[OTH],Don't screw aROUND!
[OTH],(Hey!) (Hey!)
[OTH],Stop screwin' aROUND!!
[OTH],"(Hey, God damn it!)"
[OTH],"Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!!"
[OTH],(Ugh!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance! You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?"
[OTH],(Richard.)
[OTH],"What? What's that, son?"
[OTH],Richard.
[OTH],"AAaaagh! No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you."
[OTH],"Richard, you have to move on. I want you to be happy."
[OTH],But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
[OTH],"Then say it now, Richard."
[OTH],Good-bye?
[OTH],There. Now do you feel better?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it."
[OTH],You... you're right. You're right.
[OTH],"Richard, this is Grandma."
[OTH],"Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!"
[OTH],You never said good-bye to me either.
[OTH],"Hey, Richard. Remember me?"
[OTH],"Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!"
[OTH],No! We're dead!
[OTH],"I love you, Richard. See you soon."
[OTH],"Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive. Thank you, baby. Thank you."
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up."
[OTH],"Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?"
[OTH],Rrr!
[OTH],Ugh.
[OTH],"Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you."
[OTH],"Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other."
Cartman,"Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad."
[OTH],"Boy, do we ever."
[OTH],"So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Well, I mean, that's what was on the news."
[OTH],What was on the news?
Cartman,"Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters."
[OTH],Uuh! You son of a bitch!
[OTH],I'm gonna kick your ass!
[OTH],"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
Cartman,"Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!"
[OTH],"This is shop class. My name is Mr. Adler. For the next week, rather than your normal schoolwork, you'll be learning how to make things. Now, does anybody know WHY you're in shop class? Yes?"
[OTH],"Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?"
[OTH],"Wrong! You are here because you are America's future! You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have... shop class."
Cartman,Ooooohh.
[OTH],"Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a- I have... uh, I have a..."
[OTH],Mr. Adler?
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?"
[OTH],Tweek is!
[OTH],"Arrh! No, I'm not!"
[OTH],"Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble."
[OTH],Arrrrh!
Cartman,"Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class."
[OTH],"That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we- Hey! Did you just flip me off?!"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Yes, you did!"
Cartman,Told ya!
[OTH],"Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec."
[OTH],"Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls."
[OTH],"Welcome to home ec. For the next week, you will be learning how to bake, sew, clean, and make things that are lacy and pretty."
[OTH],(Woohooo!)
[OTH],"I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here."
[OTH],"That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers. But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec."
[OTH],(Woohooo!)
Cartman,I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class?
[OTH],I don't know. He's such a wuss.
[OTH],Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
Cartman,"You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is."
[OTH],No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
Cartman,"Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass."
[OTH],Do you wanna bet?
Cartman,"Yeah, I'll bet."
[OTH],How much?
Cartman,Five bucks.
[OTH],You're on!
[OTH],Arrh!
[OTH],Hey Tweek.
[OTH],Gaarhrhrh!
[OTH],Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
[OTH],He does?
[OTH],"Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him?"
[OTH],Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
Cartman,"Craig, could I talk to you real quick? Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater."
[OTH],He did?
Cartman,"Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it."
[OTH],Why would he say that?
Cartman,"I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you."
[OTH],"Well, I've gotta go over there and-"
Cartman,"No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
[OTH],Rrrr! What a jerk!
[OTH],"He's really got it out for you, dude."
[OTH],Why?! What did I do?!
[OTH],"So, do you agree to fight him after school?"
[OTH],I guess so.
[OTH],Super. See you there.
[OTH],"Catch me, Richard. I'm so in love with you, Richard. I made you some cookies, Richard. Merry Christmas, Richard. Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. Aaaaaaa! Richard!"
[OTH],Aaaarr! Uh. Oh why? Why?
[OTH],Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
[OTH],Huh? Stop screwing around!
[OTH],The bell rang. Can we go?
[OTH],"Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed."
[OTH],"Come on, you guys."
[OTH],"This is gonna be so sweet, dude."
Cartman,You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
[OTH],We'll see!
Cartman,Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
[OTH],"You're on, fatass!"
Cartman,"Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!"
[OTH],"(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)"
[OTH],"How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?"
[OTH],"Yeah. That's not cool, dude."
[OTH],"Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow."
[OTH],"Bye, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Bye, ladies.)"
[OTH],"Hey, what's going on?"
[OTH],Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
[OTH],"Really? Cool. It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Yeah, they left."
[OTH],"Aw, hell!"
Cartman,Those sons of bitches!
[OTH],I guess they don't wanna fight.
[OTH],"Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet!"
[OTH],Tweek?
[OTH],Tweek?
[OTH],Arrh! What do you guys want?
[OTH],"How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!"
[OTH],Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
[OTH],"Well, Craig showed up."
[OTH],He did?
[OTH],"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"""
[OTH],I don't have crooked teeth!
[OTH],"And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken; well, everybody in the world saw it!"
[OTH],Everyone in the world?! Rrrr!
[OTH],"Yeah, it was weak."
[OTH],I'm not a chicken!
[OTH],"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya."
[OTH],Wait! I'll fight!
[OTH],Tomorrow?
[OTH],Okay.
Cartman,"Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!"
[OTH],Red Racer's on.
Cartman,"Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!"
[OTH],I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
Cartman,"Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom."
[OTH],Nope.
Cartman,"Egh. God damn it! Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig."
[OTH],What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
Cartman,"Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed."
[OTH],"That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!"
Cartman,"Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?"
[OTH],After Red Racer.
Cartman,"After Red Racer, of course."
[OTH],"How was school today, son?"
[OTH],Errh!
[OTH],That's great.
[OTH],"Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??"
[OTH],"Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met. You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive."
[OTH],It's true. I was.
[OTH],"Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight."
[OTH],Well?
[OTH],"Well what, honey?"
[OTH],Nrr. What happened?
[OTH],"Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something."
[OTH],"Yes, I think that's right."
[OTH],Rrrrr! You guys never help me! Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out!
[OTH],"Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow."
[OTH],With who?
[OTH],Some kid.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Don't just ""Oh"" him, Thomas!"
[OTH],"Yeah, don't just ""Oh"" me!"
[OTH],"I'll ""Oh"" whoever I want!"
[OTH],"Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later."
[OTH],"Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight."
[OTH],"Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on."
[OTH],"Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?"
[OTH],"I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts."
[OTH],We'll use plastic wrap.
[OTH],Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time.
[OTH],"Swing me Richard, swing me higher. I wanna touch the sky, Richard. Richard, I'm here! Smile. Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's what I do! Aaaaaaa! Richard! Richard."
[OTH],"Haaarrr! Aw, God, what am I gonna do?"
[OTH],"Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45."
[OTH],"Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?"
[OTH],I uh...
Cartman,"However long Craig wants it to last. T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge."
[OTH],He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
Cartman,Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass!!"
Cartman,"Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight."
[OTH],"On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes. When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE. It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy. The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two."
[OTH],"What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?"
[OTH],Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats.
Cartman,"When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world."
[OTH],"That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!"
Cartman,"Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000."
[OTH],"Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing!"
[OTH],"Ri-chard! Ri-chard! Swing me Richard, swing me higher! Richard, I'm here! Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's all for you! Aaaaaaa! Richard!"
[OTH],Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!
[OTH],"Huh? Uh, what?"
[OTH],Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander
[OTH],"The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I? Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago."
[OTH],What? She die or something?
[OTH],What? Hey! Go on! You're screwing around in here!
[OTH],Oh boy! Here we go!
[OTH],What's happening?
[OTH],Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
[OTH],Oh cool!
[OTH],"Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed. All right. Here we go."
[OTH],"Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy."
Cartman,"You're gonna be eating those words, asshole."
[OTH],"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby."
[OTH],Well?
Cartman,Come on!
[OTH],"Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!"
[OTH],What do we do?
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other."
[OTH],How?
[OTH],How??
[OTH],I've never been in a fight before.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],Awwww.
[OTH],"Aw, dude, come on!!"
Cartman,"You just hit each other, smack each other around."
[OTH],Not like that!
[OTH],"Like what, then?"
[OTH],"All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],All that build-up for nothing.
[OTH],"Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!"
[OTH],"All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig."
Cartman,"I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek."
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!"
Cartman,"Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys! I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!"
[OTH],Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
Cartman,Fine!
[OTH],Fine!
Cartman,"Fine, that's fine!"
[OTH],"Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing."
[OTH],Rrrrh!
[OTH],You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
[OTH],Mmrr I can still kick ass.
[OTH],"Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you."
[OTH],Hwaaah!
[OTH],"Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing."
[OTH],Uugh!
[OTH],"Mmm whatcha got, bee-ahtch?"
[OTH],"Keep your guard up, Tweek!"
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],Damn it!
[OTH],"Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!"
[OTH],"All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here."
[OTH],"Gmmmmm, whatcha got, bee-ahtch?"
[OTH],"Punch him in the balls, Tweek!!"
[OTH],AAAAaaaarrgh.
[OTH],"Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down!"
[OTH],Ow.
[OTH],"Good! Now kick his balls! There, see? You've got him coughing up blood."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Rrrr!
[OTH],Now THAT'S BOXING!
[OTH],"Your friend hasa brought you to learn the ancient art ofa sumo. You must learna discipline anda respect. In sumo, your body must be rike a stone, and your mind rike a meatroaf."
[OTH],Meatloaf?
[OTH],The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?
Cartman,"I'm ready! Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool."
[OTH],"Let us begin. Ready? And, th-ree."
Cartman,Respect my authoritah!
[OTH],Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!
Cartman,"Dude. Come on, now. Come on."
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!"
[OTH],Fight back! Resist the ass!
[OTH],How can I resist an ass so great?
[OTH],It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind.
[OTH],"This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master."
Cartman,I win!
[OTH],"There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession."
Cartman,"Hey, maybe."
[OTH],No. No. Make it stop.
[OTH],"Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. Don't worry, Richard. I'm a pilot! Watch me, Richard! Richard!"
[OTH],Baaaaa! I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye! Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?!
[OTH],"Okay, that was very good, class. Now let's try this one together. Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"
[OTH],"Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"
[OTH],"All right, now let's try this one together. Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car...."
[OTH],Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
[OTH],"Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one. I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life."
[OTH],I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
[OTH],"Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try? I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed."
[OTH],(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
[OTH],"O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick?"
[OTH],(Sure you can.)
[OTH],"Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you."
[OTH],(Why?)
[OTH],"Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good."
[OTH],(You don't?)
[OTH],No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class.
[OTH],"(Shop class?) (No, I won't!)"
[OTH],"Now, now. Very few students are severely injured in a shop class."
[OTH],(I don't wanna take shop class!)
[OTH],Come on! It's time for the fight!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you anything?"
[OTH],"Okay, the time has finally come."
[OTH],"Programs, get your programs here. Programs."
[OTH],"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low."
[OTH],Hrrr.
[OTH],"This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek."
[OTH],"Rrrr, mean, rrrr."
Cartman,The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
[OTH],Okay.
Cartman,"Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!"
[OTH],"Okay, okay!"
[OTH],Rrrr! Hr.
[OTH],You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
[OTH],Respect my authority.
[OTH],"Come on, Tweek!"
Cartman,"Come on, Craig!"
[OTH],"To whom it may concern: I can no longer live without her. I couldn't say goodbye to her, and so now I must say goodbye to all of you, for I am all out of nicotine gum.Sincerely yours,
Richard Adler
Shop Class
P.S. Don't screw around. You all screw around too much."
[OTH],"Good-bye, cruel world. Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell!"
[OTH],Ye-hah!
Cartman,"Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass!"
[OTH],"Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!"
Cartman,"Come on, Craig!"
[OTH],"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
[OTH],"Get him! Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Craig just called you a boner!
[OTH],Rrrr!
[OTH],We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"(Hi, Mr. Adler.)"
[OTH],"What? Who are you? ""Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class."" Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there. Hrh."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],What the-?
[OTH],Here they are.
[OTH],Hey! What's going on?
[OTH],Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching.
[OTH],"Well, why the hell don't you stop them?"
Cartman,'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
[OTH],Don't screw aROUND!
[OTH],(Hey!) (Hey!)
[OTH],Stop screwin' aROUND!!
[OTH],"(Hey, God damn it!)"
[OTH],"Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!!"
[OTH],(Ugh!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance! You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?"
[OTH],(Richard.)
[OTH],"What? What's that, son?"
[OTH],Richard.
[OTH],"AAaaagh! No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you."
[OTH],"Richard, you have to move on. I want you to be happy."
[OTH],But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
[OTH],"Then say it now, Richard."
[OTH],Good-bye?
[OTH],There. Now do you feel better?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it."
[OTH],You... you're right. You're right.
[OTH],"Richard, this is Grandma."
[OTH],"Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!"
[OTH],You never said good-bye to me either.
[OTH],"Hey, Richard. Remember me?"
[OTH],"Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!"
[OTH],No! We're dead!
[OTH],"I love you, Richard. See you soon."
[OTH],"Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive. Thank you, baby. Thank you."
[OTH],"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
[OTH],"Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up."
[OTH],"Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?"
[OTH],Rrr!
[OTH],Ugh.
[OTH],"Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you."
[OTH],"Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other."
Cartman,"Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad."
[OTH],"Boy, do we ever."
[OTH],"So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Well, I mean, that's what was on the news."
[OTH],What was on the news?
Cartman,"Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters."
[OTH],Uuh! You son of a bitch!
[OTH],I'm gonna kick your ass!
[OTH],"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
Cartman,"Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!"
[OTH],"Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school."
[OTH],About what?
[OTH],"Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means? Yes, Eric?"
Cartman,"When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind."
[OTH],"...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Peetie, the Sexual Harassment Panda."
[OTH],"Who lives in the east 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
Who explains sexual harassment to you and me?

Sexual Harassment Panda


Hi, boys and girls."
[OTH],"Say ""hi"" to Sexual Harassment Panda!"
[OTH],"Hi, Sexual Harassment Panda."
[OTH],Hababah...
[OTH],"Did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear, that's sexual harassment? That makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda."
[OTH],"This is freaking me out, dude."
[OTH],"And when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear, that makes me a very sad panda. Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law."
[OTH],Awgh..!
[OTH],"""...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make..."""
[OTH],"Ohh, dude, get me out of here!"
Cartman,I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
[OTH],"You would think that, you little ass-sucker."
Cartman,What did you call me?
[OTH],"An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker."
Cartman,That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],What?
Cartman,You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
[OTH],"That's right, he can."
[OTH],"No you can't, you little ass-sucker!"
Cartman,"Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!"
[OTH],"""The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda."""
[OTH],"This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?"
Cartman,"Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second."
[OTH],Dude! He got a lawyer?
[OTH],Sorry I'm late.
[OTH],Dad?!
[OTH],"Oh! Hi, Kyle."
[OTH],"All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school."
Cartman,"Th... That is correct, my honor."
[OTH],"Hoh, whatever!"
Cartman,He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
[OTH],I called you an ass-sucker!
Cartman,"Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset. I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes."
[OTH],"What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!"
[OTH],"As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue."
[OTH],"Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?"
[OTH],Wwhat do you mean?
[OTH],I need to hear your defense.
[OTH],Uh... I'm eight?
[OTH],"All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"All right, we did it!"
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],"Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately."
[OTH],I have to give him half my stuff?
Cartman,Sweet..!
Cartman,"Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game , and that Power Jim doll. And, let's see... Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy."
Cartman,"Oh, well, I'll just take that, then. And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?"
[OTH],"Uh, no! I hate that toy!"
Cartman,"Oh, then you won't mind if I take it!"
[OTH],Damnit!
[OTH],Here you go. As your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football.
[OTH],"Hm. You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh..."
Cartman,Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
[OTH],"Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools. Perhaps we should sue them next."
Cartman,"What? But uh, why should I sue the school?"
[OTH],"Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings."
Cartman,"Interesting. Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that."
[OTH],Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?
[OTH],"No, I had no freakin' idea!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?"
[OTH],"Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!"
[OTH],"You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, toots."
[OTH],"Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],And you did nothing.
[OTH],"Well, he is a little ass-sucker."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!"
[OTH],"Okay, baby, I'm sorry."
[OTH],"Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?"
[OTH],"Well, not any more than any other student."
[OTH],Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
[OTH],I don't know!
[OTH],You don't know?! You're the principal!
[OTH],I can't be around every second!
[OTH],So it DOES go on!!!
[OTH],"All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!! OH GOD!!!"
[OTH],"Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?"
[OTH],"I believe so, yes."
[OTH],That's sexual harassment.
[OTH],"Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda."
[OTH],"Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda"
[OTH],"Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?"
[OTH],"Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that is sexual harassment."
[OTH],And who's to blame?
[OTH],I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible.
[OTH],There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
[OTH],Panda.
[OTH],Pan-Panda's mouth.
[OTH],"After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages."
[OTH],"All right! We did it, Eric!"
Cartman,"It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah"
[OTH],"That goes in the master bedroom. Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?"
[OTH],It's... big.
[OTH],"Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big."
[OTH],"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?"
[OTH],"Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million."
[OTH],And you don't see a problem with that?
[OTH],No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
[OTH],"You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?"
[OTH],"Sort of, yeah."
[OTH],"Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions? Yes, Stan?"
[OTH],Where's our desks?
[OTH],"Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits."
[OTH],"You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?"
Cartman,"All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!"
[OTH],Wow! I wanna sue somebody!
[OTH],"Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun."
[OTH],AAGGGHHH!!
[OTH],"I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, ""The ball is red..."""
[OTH],AAGGGGHHH!!
[OTH],"Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!"
[OTH],"After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad!"
[OTH],"Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls!"
[OTH],"So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me!"
[OTH],"'Kids picking on you? Well, don't be sad
Just sue their asses with Kyle's dad"
[OTH],"All right, what other cuts do we have to make to the school budget?"
[OTH],"Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools."
[OTH],"Oh, right. We certainly can't afford him anymore."
[OTH],"I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously."
[OTH],"Hello, sexual harassment cubs.


Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda"
[OTH],"Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda.
[OTH],"Oh, all right."
[OTH],"Uh—M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a ""panda"" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children."
[OTH],"You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment. At all."
[OTH],...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go.
[OTH],I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.
[OTH],"Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school."
Cartman,No way!
[OTH],I won!
Cartman,This is ridiculous!
[OTH],"You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million."
[OTH],"Oh, dear God!"
[OTH],"Wow, I'm good!"
[OTH],Next!
[OTH],This girl touched my thigh.
[OTH],"Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million."
[OTH],We're ruined!
[OTH],Next!
[OTH],"Uh, Your Honor, this young man commented on the shape of my ass."
[OTH],Guh!
[OTH],"Half his stuff, 2 million from the school."
[OTH],Oh..!
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today. Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?"
[OTH],Um...
[OTH],Don't answer that!
[OTH],"Uh, Craig, how about you?"
[OTH],Um... Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
[OTH],Incriminate.
[OTH],Incriminate.
[OTH],"Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time! Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight. Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum..."
[OTH],Let's trade sandwiches.
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How's it going?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],"Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes."
Cartman,"Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut."
Cartman,Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
[OTH],"Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?"
[OTH],"I don't know, children. Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?"
[OTH],"I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money."
[OTH],"Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge."
[OTH],"Hey, what about that stupid panda?"
[OTH],"Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!"
[OTH],"Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out."
Cartman,Noooo!
[OTH],That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours.
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs.
[OTH],The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
[OTH],"Holy smokes, you're right!"
[OTH],"'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please."
[OTH],Ugh! P-please! Don't sue us.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],We'll give you anything you want.
[OTH],We want Sexual Harassment Panda.
[OTH],"Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"D'uh. I mean, he left."
[OTH],"Well, where is he?!"
[OTH],"We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!"
[OTH],What the hell is wrong with these people?!
[OTH],"Well. Uh, your credentials are very impressive, and you do seem to have a lot of ambition, uh but I'm afraid there's no room for you at our company at this time."
[OTH],"It's because I'm a panda, isn't it?"
[OTH],"Well, i-it is because you're a panda. Euh, it's because you're a sexual harassment panda."
[OTH],I can't help what I am.
[OTH],"Now, have you ever heard of a retreat called ""The Island of Misfit Mascots""?"
[OTH],"Well, yes, but that place is for loser mascots that make no sense."
[OTH],"Well, uh, yes. They may be... just what you're looking for."
[OTH],I don't have to sit here and listen to this! How would you like a big panda punch in your puss?!
[OTH],"As sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state, the mother of all trials is set to begin. The sexual harassment case of Everyone vs. Everyone begins tomorrow. No matter what the outcome, the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping $30 million. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski, the lawyer from South Park who plans to make quite a commission. Representing the side of Everyone Else is Gerald Broflovski. So whatever the outcome, things look very bright for Kyle's dad. Personally, I think Kyle's dad is just a whore, taking advantage of everyone in town and... This just in! Newscaster Kevin McCarty is being sued by Kyle's dad for slander. The newscaster has yet to be reached for comment. Wait..."
[OTH],"Some days just seem lonely
Still, there don't seem to be no end in sight..."
[OTH],Another scotch?
[OTH],So I'll drive this ol' 18-wheeler down the highway...
[OTH],Hey! Panda bear! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
[OTH],"Now, calm down, Skeeter. He ain't hurtin' nobody."
[OTH],"No! I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?!"
[OTH],"Sk-heeter, I don't want no trouble nu-how."
[OTH],"It's okay. I get it. There's no room in the world for pandas. Well, you don't have to worry about me! I'm off to the Island of Misfit Mascots!"
[OTH],"Damnit, Skeeter! How come every time a panda bear come in here you gotta go flappin' your jaw?"
[OTH],"Well? What do you think, Kyle?"
[OTH],Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
[OTH],"Well, this one is bigger!"
[OTH],"Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!"
[OTH],"Kyle, let me explain something to you."
[OTH],"Hoh God, here we go."
[OTH],"You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace."
[OTH],Isn't that fascism?
[OTH],"No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?"
[OTH],Do you?
[OTH],"Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it."
[OTH],'Scuse me.
[OTH],Yeah? What can I do for you?
[OTH],Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
[OTH],"Big panda bear, big panda bear, hm..."
[OTH],Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
[OTH],"Now, calm down, Skeeter. They ain't hurtin' nobody."
[OTH],No! I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!
[OTH],...Coats?
[OTH],"Now, Skeeter, I don't want no trouble."
[OTH],We don't take kindly to your types around here!
[OTH],"Dude, what the hell is going in?!"
Cartman,"Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?"
[OTH],We don't take kindly to panda bears!
[OTH],"Well, we don't take kindly to you!"
[OTH],"Well, we don't take kindly to folks that don't take kindly around here."
[OTH],"Kids, there was a panda bear in here. He said somethin' about the Island of Misfit Mascots."
Cartman,Where's that?
[OTH],"If I'm not mistaken, it's over near the Jenkins' place."
[OTH],"Come on, we'd better hurry."
[OTH],Whoa! Lookie her! Hey! Beautiful woman! We don't take kindly to your types around here!
[OTH],"Nu-how, Skeeter. She ain't hurtin' nobody."
[OTH],"This is Case No. 47g, Everyone vs. Everyone. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski."
[OTH],"Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated."
[OTH],"""Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune"". This must be the place."
[OTH],"Hello there, boys."
[OTH],Whoa! Who are you?
[OTH],"I'm Willy, the ""Don't Stare Directly Into The Sun"" Worm. Now, you boys know not to stare directly into the sun, right?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],That can burn your retinas and make you blind.
[OTH],"...Thanks a lot, dude."
[OTH],"Oink oink! Be sure to run around with scissors, says Oinky, the ""Run Around With Scissors"" Pig."
Cartman,I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
[OTH],That's why he's on the Island Of Misfit Mascots.
[OTH],Have you seen any panda bears?
[OTH],Hm...
[OTH],"Hey, kids! I'm Jimmy, the ""Don't Hold On To A Large Magnet While Someone Else Uses A Fan Nearby"" Falcon!"
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Here, watch."
[OTH],"(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!) (Argh--!)"
[OTH],See?
[OTH],Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
[OTH],You bastards! Hey! There he is!
[OTH],"Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda"
[OTH],"Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!"
[OTH],Seems all I do now is cause trouble.
[OTH],"Hello, kidsh, I'm Hoppy, the ""Don't Do Stuff That Might Irritate Your Inner Ear"" Badger. Well, I'll leave now."
[OTH],"Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other."
[OTH],"But, I'm just a panda."
[OTH],"No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume!"
[OTH],"Heeyy, I'm a real worm, pal!!"
[OTH],"Okay, sorry, sorry."
Cartman,"You're-you're a worm. That's-that's cool, that's cool."
[OTH],"Okay, you are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new message that people will find useful again."
[OTH],What message?
[OTH],That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
[OTH],...You know? You little cubs might just be right.
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Okay!
[OTH],"Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments."
[OTH],Wait!
[OTH],"Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda."
[OTH],"No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say."
[OTH],"Hello, everyone. I'm Peetie, the ""Don't Sue People"" Panda."
[OTH],"""Don't Sue People"" Panda?"
[OTH],Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here!
[OTH],"Nuhow, Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody."
[OTH],"Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you. There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda."
[OTH],"I'm a sad panda, too."
[OTH],I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault!
[OTH],Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and too easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!"
[OTH],"""Don't Sue People"" Panda."
[OTH],"Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Pandas love ice cream.
[OTH],"Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed!"
[OTH],Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!
[OTH],"God damnit, Skeeter, shut the hell up."
[OTH],"Hello, cubs. I'm ""Don't Sue People"" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now."
[OTH],"Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school."
[OTH],About what?
[OTH],"Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means? Yes, Eric?"
Cartman,"When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind."
[OTH],"...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Peetie, the Sexual Harassment Panda."
[OTH],"Who lives in the east 'neath the willow tree?

Sexual Harassment Panda


Hi, boys and girls."
[OTH],"Say ""hi"" to Sexual Harassment Panda!"
[OTH],"Hi, Sexual Harassment Panda."
[OTH],Hababah...
[OTH],"Did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear, that's sexual harassment? That makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda."
[OTH],"This is freaking me out, dude."
[OTH],"And when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear, that makes me a very sad panda. Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law."
[OTH],Awgh..!
[OTH],"""...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make..."""
[OTH],"Ohh, dude, get me out of here!"
Cartman,I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
[OTH],"You would think that, you little ass-sucker."
Cartman,What did you call me?
[OTH],"An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker."
Cartman,That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],What?
Cartman,You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
[OTH],"That's right, he can."
[OTH],"No you can't, you little ass-sucker!"
Cartman,"Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!"
[OTH],"""The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda."""
[OTH],"This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?"
Cartman,"Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second."
[OTH],Dude! He got a lawyer?
[OTH],Sorry I'm late.
[OTH],Dad?!
[OTH],"Oh! Hi, Kyle."
[OTH],"All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school."
Cartman,"Th... That is correct, my honor."
[OTH],"Hoh, whatever!"
Cartman,He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
[OTH],I called you an ass-sucker!
Cartman,"Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset. I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes."
[OTH],"What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!"
[OTH],"As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue."
[OTH],"Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?"
[OTH],Wwhat do you mean?
[OTH],I need to hear your defense.
[OTH],Uh... I'm eight?
[OTH],"All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"All right, we did it!"
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],"Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately."
[OTH],I have to give him half my stuff?
Cartman,Sweet..!
Cartman,"Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game , and that Power Jim doll. And, let's see... Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy."
Cartman,"Oh, well, I'll just take that, then. And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?"
[OTH],"Uh, no! I hate that toy!"
Cartman,"Oh, then you won't mind if I take it!"
[OTH],Damnit!
[OTH],Here you go. As your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football.
[OTH],"Hm. You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh..."
Cartman,Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
[OTH],"Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools. Perhaps we should sue them next."
Cartman,"What? But uh, why should I sue the school?"
[OTH],"Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings."
Cartman,"Interesting. Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that."
[OTH],Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?
[OTH],"No, I had no freakin' idea!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?"
[OTH],"Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!"
[OTH],"You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, toots."
[OTH],"Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],And you did nothing.
[OTH],"Well, he is a little ass-sucker."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!"
[OTH],"Okay, baby, I'm sorry."
[OTH],"Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?"
[OTH],"Well, not any more than any other student."
[OTH],Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
[OTH],I don't know!
[OTH],You don't know?! You're the principal!
[OTH],I can't be around every second!
[OTH],So it DOES go on!!!
[OTH],"All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!! OH GOD!!!"
[OTH],"Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?"
[OTH],"I believe so, yes."
[OTH],That's sexual harassment.
[OTH],"Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda."
[OTH],"Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda"
[OTH],"Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?"
[OTH],"Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that is sexual harassment."
[OTH],And who's to blame?
[OTH],I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible.
[OTH],There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
[OTH],Panda.
[OTH],Pan-Panda's mouth.
[OTH],"After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages."
[OTH],"All right! We did it, Eric!"
Cartman,"It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah"
[OTH],"That goes in the master bedroom. Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?"
[OTH],It's... big.
[OTH],"Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big."
[OTH],"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?"
[OTH],"Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million."
[OTH],And you don't see a problem with that?
[OTH],No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
[OTH],"You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?"
[OTH],"Sort of, yeah."
[OTH],"Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions? Yes, Stan?"
[OTH],Where's our desks?
[OTH],"Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits."
[OTH],"You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?"
Cartman,"All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!"
[OTH],Wow! I wanna sue somebody!
[OTH],"Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun."
[OTH],AAGGGHHH!!
[OTH],"I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, ""The ball is red..."""
[OTH],AAGGGGHHH!!
[OTH],"Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!"
[OTH],"After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad!"
[OTH],"Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls!"
[OTH],"So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me!"
[OTH],"'Kids picking on you? Well, don't be sad
Just sue their asses with Kyle's dad"
[OTH],"All right, what other cuts do we have to make to the school budget?"
[OTH],"Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools."
[OTH],"Oh, right. We certainly can't afford him anymore."
[OTH],"I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously."
[OTH],"Hello, sexual harassment cubs.


Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda"
[OTH],"Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda.
[OTH],"Oh, all right."
[OTH],"Uh—M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a ""panda"" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children."
[OTH],"You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment. At all."
[OTH],...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go.
[OTH],I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.
[OTH],"Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school."
Cartman,No way!
[OTH],I won!
Cartman,This is ridiculous!
[OTH],"You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million."
[OTH],"Oh, dear God!"
[OTH],"Wow, I'm good!"
[OTH],Next!
[OTH],This girl touched my thigh.
[OTH],"Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million."
[OTH],We're ruined!
[OTH],Next!
[OTH],"Uh, Your Honor, this young man commented on the shape of my ass."
[OTH],Guh!
[OTH],"Half his stuff, 2 million from the school."
[OTH],Oh..!
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today. Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?"
[OTH],Um...
[OTH],Don't answer that!
[OTH],"Uh, Craig, how about you?"
[OTH],Um... Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
[OTH],Incriminate.
[OTH],Incriminate.
[OTH],"Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time! Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight. Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum..."
[OTH],Let's trade sandwiches.
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How's it going?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],"Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes."
Cartman,"Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut."
Cartman,Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
[OTH],"Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?"
[OTH],"I don't know, children. Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?"
[OTH],"I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money."
[OTH],"Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge."
[OTH],"Hey, what about that stupid panda?"
[OTH],"Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!"
[OTH],"Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out."
Cartman,Noooo!
[OTH],That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours.
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs.
[OTH],The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
[OTH],"Holy smokes, you're right!"
[OTH],"'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please."
[OTH],Ugh! P-please! Don't sue us.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],We'll give you anything you want.
[OTH],We want Sexual Harassment Panda.
[OTH],"Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"D'uh. I mean, he left."
[OTH],"Well, where is he?!"
[OTH],"We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!"
[OTH],What the hell is wrong with these people?!
[OTH],"Well. Uh, your credentials are very impressive, and you do seem to have a lot of ambition, uh but I'm afraid there's no room for you at our company at this time."
[OTH],"It's because I'm a panda, isn't it?"
[OTH],"Well, i-it is because you're a panda. Euh, it's because you're a sexual harassment panda."
[OTH],I can't help what I am.
[OTH],"Now, have you ever heard of a retreat called ""The Island of Misfit Mascots""?"
[OTH],"Well, yes, but that place is for loser mascots that make no sense."
[OTH],"Well, uh, yes. They may be... just what you're looking for."
[OTH],I don't have to sit here and listen to this! How would you like a big panda punch in your puss?!
[OTH],"As sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state, the mother of all trials is set to begin. The sexual harassment case of Everyone vs. Everyone begins tomorrow. No matter what the outcome, the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping $30 million. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski, the lawyer from South Park who plans to make quite a commission. Representing the side of Everyone Else is Gerald Broflovski. So whatever the outcome, things look very bright for Kyle's dad. Personally, I think Kyle's dad is just a whore, taking advantage of everyone in town and... This just in! Newscaster Kevin McCarty is being sued by Kyle's dad for slander. The newscaster has yet to be reached for comment. Wait..."
[OTH],"Some days just seem lonely
Still, there don't seem to be no end in sight..."
[OTH],Another scotch?
[OTH],So I'll drive this ol' 18-wheeler down the highway...
[OTH],Hey! Panda bear! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
[OTH],"Now, calm down, Skeeter. He ain't hurtin' nobody."
[OTH],"No! I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?!"
[OTH],"Sk-heeter, I don't want no trouble nu-how."
[OTH],"It's okay. I get it. There's no room in the world for pandas. Well, you don't have to worry about me! I'm off to the Island of Misfit Mascots!"
[OTH],"Damnit, Skeeter! How come every time a panda bear come in here you gotta go flappin' your jaw?"
[OTH],"Well? What do you think, Kyle?"
[OTH],Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
[OTH],"Well, this one is bigger!"
[OTH],"Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!"
[OTH],"Kyle, let me explain something to you."
[OTH],"Hoh God, here we go."
[OTH],"You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace."
[OTH],Isn't that fascism?
[OTH],"No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?"
[OTH],Do you?
[OTH],"Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it."
[OTH],'Scuse me.
[OTH],Yeah? What can I do for you?
[OTH],Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
[OTH],"Big panda bear, big panda bear, hm..."
[OTH],Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
[OTH],"Now, calm down, Skeeter. They ain't hurtin' nobody."
[OTH],No! I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!
[OTH],...Coats?
[OTH],"Now, Skeeter, I don't want no trouble."
[OTH],We don't take kindly to your types around here!
[OTH],"Dude, what the hell is going in?!"
Cartman,"Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?"
[OTH],We don't take kindly to panda bears!
[OTH],"Well, we don't take kindly to you!"
[OTH],"Well, we don't take kindly to folks that don't take kindly around here."
[OTH],"Kids, there was a panda bear in here. He said somethin' about the Island of Misfit Mascots."
Cartman,Where's that?
[OTH],"If I'm not mistaken, it's over near the Jenkins' place."
[OTH],"Come on, we'd better hurry."
[OTH],Whoa! Lookie her! Hey! Beautiful woman! We don't take kindly to your types around here!
[OTH],"Nu-how, Skeeter. She ain't hurtin' nobody."
[OTH],"This is Case No. 47g, Everyone vs. Everyone. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski."
[OTH],"Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated."
[OTH],"""Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune"". This must be the place."
[OTH],"Hello there, boys."
[OTH],Whoa! Who are you?
[OTH],"I'm Willy, the ""Don't Stare Directly Into The Sun"" Worm. Now, you boys know not to stare directly into the sun, right?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],That can burn your retinas and make you blind.
[OTH],"...Thanks a lot, dude."
[OTH],"Oink oink! Be sure to run around with scissors, says Oinky, the ""Run Around With Scissors"" Pig."
Cartman,I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
[OTH],That's why he's on the Island Of Misfit Mascots.
[OTH],Have you seen any panda bears?
[OTH],Hm...
[OTH],"Hey, kids! I'm Jimmy, the ""Don't Hold On To A Large Magnet While Someone Else Uses A Fan Nearby"" Falcon!"
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Here, watch."
[OTH],"(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!) (Argh--!)"
[OTH],See?
[OTH],Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
[OTH],You bastards! Hey! There he is!
[OTH],"Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda"
[OTH],"Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!"
[OTH],Seems all I do now is cause trouble.
[OTH],"Hello, kidsh, I'm Hoppy, the ""Don't Do Stuff That Might Irritate Your Inner Ear"" Badger. Well, I'll leave now."
[OTH],"Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other."
[OTH],"But, I'm just a panda."
[OTH],"No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume!"
[OTH],"Heeyy, I'm a real worm, pal!!"
[OTH],"Okay, sorry, sorry."
Cartman,"You're-you're a worm. That's-that's cool, that's cool."
[OTH],"Okay, you are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new message that people will find useful again."
[OTH],What message?
[OTH],That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
[OTH],...You know? You little cubs might just be right.
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Okay!
[OTH],"Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments."
[OTH],Wait!
[OTH],"Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda."
[OTH],"No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say."
[OTH],"Hello, everyone. I'm Peetie, the ""Don't Sue People"" Panda."
[OTH],"""Don't Sue People"" Panda?"
[OTH],Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here!
[OTH],"Nuhow, Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody."
[OTH],"Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you. There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda."
[OTH],"I'm a sad panda, too."
[OTH],I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault!
[OTH],Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and too easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!"
[OTH],"""Don't Sue People"" Panda."
[OTH],"Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Pandas love ice cream.
[OTH],"Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed!"
[OTH],Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!
[OTH],"God damnit, Skeeter, shut the hell up."
[OTH],"Hello, cubs. I'm ""Don't Sue People"" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now."
[OTH],Heheheheh! Now I will kill the President and Salma Hayek!
[OTH],"Oh, save me! Who will save me?"
Cartman,"I will! James West, cowboy and rap star! Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!"
[OTH],"If we save her, I am going to take off her pants and play Slip'N'Slide!"
Cartman,"Are you okay, Salma Hayek?"
[OTH],"Yes, but I need to get out of here and eat some tacos and burritos. Me gusta tacos mucho!"
[OTH],"You cannot stop me, James West!"
Cartman,"Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider! Bang! Bangbang! Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang! We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch..."
[OTH],Eric. The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs.
Cartman,"But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West."
[OTH],"I have to leave soon, Eric."
Cartman,"But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek."
[OTH],Come down as soon as you're done.
Cartman,"Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside-"
[OTH],"Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],All those other babysitters won't come back.
[OTH],"I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time."
[OTH],"Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears."
[OTH],Bears?
[OTH],Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
[OTH],Meowrowr!
Cartman,"No, Kitty! I don't have anything!"
[OTH],Meow rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!"
[OTH],Rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
Cartman,"No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty!"
[OTH],"Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?"
Cartman,Uh-huh.
[OTH],Be good.
Cartman,Right.
[OTH],Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses!
Cartman,"Aw, Ma."
[OTH],Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!
Cartman,Jesus Christ.
[OTH],"Bye, kids."
Cartman,"Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry! Ow!"
[OTH],"Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!"
Cartman,You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV?
[OTH],"My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!"
Cartman,You're not allowed to have people over!
[OTH],Move!
Cartman,This is bullcrap! I can't reach the freezer!
[OTH],"Figure it out, turd!"
Cartman,"God dammit! Shut up, Kitty! Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha! I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd!"
[OTH],"...So I said, ""you're a little turd!"" and he w-"
Cartman,Dammit!
[OTH],"...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all. ...stupid turd! The one night-"
Cartman,Ey! I need to use the phone!
[OTH],"Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie."
Cartman,Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah!
[OTH],I placed his underwear over his head.
Cartman,"I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!! SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!!"
[OTH],"And now, back to the movie of the week, Aliens."
[OTH],"They mostly come at night, mostly."
Cartman,"They mostly come at night, mostly. Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!"
[OTH],"Well, I'm watching Friends, turd! That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces."
[OTH],"Hey there, is Shelly around?"
Cartman,Who the hell are you?
[OTH],I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot up your ass if you don't tell me where Shelly is!
[OTH],"Hey, Skyler."
Cartman,You know this guy?
[OTH],He's my boyfriend!
Cartman,"Christ, he's like 50 years old!"
[OTH],He's 22!
Cartman,"Dude, that's not cool."
[OTH],You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
[OTH],Ye Yeah-ha.
Cartman,"Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly. Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit!"
[OTH],"Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments"
[OTH],"And now, back to Wild Animal World"
[OTH],"Here in the more arid regions of Africa, the gold-coat lions are in the throes of mating season. The male lion positions himself behind the female and prepares to insert his lionhood. Notice his large swollen balls. The female lion relaxes her body and says ""hello"" to Mr. Winky. The male lion is enticed by the female's supple breasts and firm backside. Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished. Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave. He promises he'll call her tomorrow. But the female doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed."
[OTH],Mmmmm.
[OTH],"No, Skyler. Quit it."
[OTH],"Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?"
[OTH],Eight days tomorrow.
[OTH],And I still don't get any action.
[OTH],"I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all."
[OTH],But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.
[OTH],"Well, maybe just one kiss."
[OTH],Mmmmm
Cartman,"Hey, what are you doing?"
[OTH],"Beat it, chubby!"
[OTH],"Go on, Astroturd!"
[OTH],Mmmmm
Cartman,I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
[OTH],Turd Rock From the Sun!
Cartman,Ey! You ate all the pizza!
[OTH],We left you some crusts!
Cartman,"That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass!"
[OTH],"Guess again, Richard the Turd!"
Cartman,Give me that phone number!
[OTH],"Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room."
Cartman,I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick! Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip."
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip."
[OTH],Meowrowrowrowrowrowrowrowr.
[OTH],"Red Rocket spills my icy soul.
Demons from Hell seek the chosen one!"
[OTH],"You're such an amazing poet, Skyler."
[OTH],"Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the best of its kind, and not a scratch on it."
[OTH],"Skyler, not here."
[OTH],I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them.
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff."
[OTH],"O Skyler, I love you."
[OTH],Mmmmm.
[OTH],What the-?
Cartman,"Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!"
[OTH],Give me that picture!
Cartman,Aaaaa! Yes!
[OTH],"Open this door, Turdledove!"
Cartman,I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
[OTH],Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you.
[OTH],"Give me that picture, turd!"
Cartman,You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
[OTH],I'm gonna bust this door down!
Cartman,"What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog?"
[OTH],We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
Cartman,"Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog. Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar. You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me. Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope! That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty!"
[OTH],Meow. Meow.
Cartman,Oh! God dammit!
[OTH],Who is that?!
[OTH],"Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice."
[OTH],"Skyler, your band can't practice here."
[OTH],"Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe! 'Sup Mark? 'Sup up. Jonesy?"
[OTH],Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy.
Cartman,Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
[OTH],Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
Cartman,You just want me to open the door!
[OTH],We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
Cartman,What?? Ih- is she okay?
[OTH],Not really. She's dead.
Cartman,Huh?!
[OTH],Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!
Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!"
[OTH],"HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!"
Cartman,"Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!"
[OTH],You mean this one?
Cartman,"O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, dammit! AAAAH!"
[OTH],"Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly, Shelly."
Cartman,"Aw, man, you guys suck."
[OTH],"Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly."
Cartman,You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
[OTH],"Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly"

[OTH],"Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?"
[OTH],Honestly? I think you guys need some work.
[OTH],"Oh, really?!"
[OTH],I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
[OTH],"Oh, I'd like to see you do any better, bitch!"
[OTH],"Well, I do have a song I wrote."
[OTH],"O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?"
[OTH],"Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed!"
[OTH],"Hey man, don't be shy."
[OTH],"Uhwwell, okay. I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. 1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can flush our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever."
[OTH],Don't you know? Isn't...
[OTH],"Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!"
Cartman,Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
[OTH],"No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors."
Cartman,"Well, there's a whole crappy band here! Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them?"
[OTH],"This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up."
Cartman,Dammit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!
[OTH],"Not really, hon. Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour! Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!"
[OTH],"Mhm, mkay?"
Cartman,I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here! My Speak and Record bear. Of course.
[OTH],In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
[OTH],"Dude, this is gay!"
[OTH],Shut up!
[OTH],You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? She's like, 12."
[OTH],"You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said!"

Cartman,"Testing, testing, 1 2. Sweet."
[OTH],"We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!"
Cartman,Okay. See you in a while.
[OTH],Wha-?
Cartman,"Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly."
[OTH],What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
Cartman,"Well, I just, I kind of like having you around."
[OTH],What?! No you don't!
Cartman,"No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family. I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day."
[OTH],"...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us."
Cartman,"Yuh, you mean it?"
[OTH],But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
Cartman,"Hooray! Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly."
Cartman,"Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now."
[OTH],"Shut up, turd!"
Cartman,"That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve."
[OTH],What are you doing?
Cartman,"I'm just thinking out loud. Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?"
[OTH],"Go away, turd!"
Cartman,"I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler? Agh!"
[OTH],Meow
[OTH],Yeah! Come on! Give it up!
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Give it up, babe!"
[OTH],NO!
[OTH],"Come on, babih!"
[OTH],"No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!"
[OTH],Why the hell not?!
[OTH],'Cause I'm twelve!
[OTH],You're not putting out for me?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will!"
[OTH],What?? But I thought you liked me.
[OTH],"If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there! Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!"
Cartman,Gotcha!
Cartman,"Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted! Hey! I said, guess who's busted! Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!"
[OTH],I don't care. He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before. I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.
Cartman,"Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?"
[OTH],Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
Cartman,You're not ugly.
[OTH],You don't think so?
Cartman,"Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?"
[OTH],You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.
Cartman,"Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know."
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"If you want, I could help you."
[OTH],Really? You would do that?
Cartman,Just let me get my cowboy hat.
[OTH],Mreow? Mreow? Mreow!
[OTH],What the hell is this?!
[OTH],Help me! Help me! This is Salma Hayek. Is anybody there?
[OTH],"Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot."
Cartman,"Okay, it's clear."
[OTH],"Over here! Please, come quick!"
Cartman,We don't have much time!
[OTH],This won't take me long!
Cartman,Hurry up in there!
[OTH],I'm almost done.
[OTH],"Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?"
[OTH],Over here! Please help me! I am lost and I have no clothes!

[OTH],"Right here, Miss Hayek!"
[OTH],"Oh, please help me!"
[OTH],What the?
[OTH],Please help me! I will give you tacos!
[OTH],"Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God dammit! Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night! My guitar! NOOOOO!"
Cartman,That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
[OTH],"Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay."
Cartman,Oh my God!
[OTH],They're having a cat orgy!
Cartman,"You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!"
[OTH],Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
Cartman,"Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on. That's it. Come on, come on. Uh oh."
[OTH],"You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you! Umph! Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh! Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!"
[OTH],"Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home. You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends."
Cartman,Yeah. I think we get along okay.
[OTH],"Hi, kids. I'm home."
Cartman,Heh. Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!
[OTH],No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
[OTH],"Oh, what a party that was! Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm."
[OTH],"Wow, she passed out."
Cartman,"Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush."
[OTH],"Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay."
Cartman,That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West.
Cartman,"Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's

Cartman,"I will! James West, cowboy and rap star! Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!"
[OTH],"If we save her, I am going to take off her pants and play Slip'N'Slide!"
Cartman,"Are you okay, Salma Hayek?"
[OTH],"Yes, but I need to get out of here and eat some tacos and burritos. Me gusta tacos mucho!"
[OTH],"You cannot stop me, James West!"
Cartman,"Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider! Bang! Bangbang! Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang! We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch..."
[OTH],Eric. The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs.
Cartman,"But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West."
[OTH],"I have to leave soon, Eric."
Cartman,"But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek."

[OTH],"Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],All those other babysitters won't come back.
[OTH],"I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time."
[OTH],"Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears."
[OTH],Bears?
[OTH],Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
[OTH],Meowrowr!
Cartman,"No, Kitty! I don't have anything!"
[OTH],Meow rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!"
[OTH],Rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
Cartman,"No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty!"
[OTH],"Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?"
Cartman,Uh-huh.
[OTH],Be good.
Cartman,Right.
[OTH],Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses!
Cartman,"Aw, Ma."
[OTH],Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!
Cartman,Jesus Christ.
[OTH],"Bye, kids."
Cartman,"Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry! Ow!"
[OTH],"Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!"
Cartman,You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV?
[OTH],"My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!"
Cartman,You're not allowed to have people over!
[OTH],Move!
Cartman,This is bullcrap! I can't reach the freezer!
[OTH],"Figure it out, turd!"
Cartman,"God dammit! Shut up, Kitty! Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha! I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd!"
[OTH],"...So I said, ""you're a little turd!"" and he w-"
Cartman,Dammit!
[OTH],"...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all. ...stupid turd! The one night-"
Cartman,Ey! I need to use the phone!
[OTH],"Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie."
Cartman,Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah!
[OTH],I placed his underwear over his head.
Cartman,"I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!! SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!!"
[OTH],"And now, back to the movie of the week, Aliens."
[OTH],"They mostly come at night, mostly."
Cartman,"They mostly come at night, mostly. Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!"
[OTH],"Well, I'm watching Friends, turd! That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces."
[OTH],"Hey there, is Shelly around?"
Cartman,Who the hell are you?
[OTH],I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot up your ass if you don't tell me where Shelly is!
[OTH],"Hey, Skyler."
Cartman,You know this guy?
[OTH],He's my boyfriend!
Cartman,"Christ, he's like 50 years old!"
[OTH],He's 22!
Cartman,"Dude, that's not cool."
[OTH],You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
[OTH],Ye Yeah-ha.
Cartman,"Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly. Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit!"
[OTH],"Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments"
[OTH],"And now, back to Wild Animal World"
[OTH],"Here in the more arid regions of Africa, the gold-coat lions are in the throes of mating season. The male lion positions himself behind the female and prepares to insert his lionhood. Notice his large swollen balls. The female lion relaxes her body and says ""hello"" to Mr. Winky. The male lion is enticed by the female's supple breasts and firm backside. Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished. Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave. He promises he'll call her tomorrow. But the female doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed."
[OTH],Mmmmm.
[OTH],"No, Skyler. Quit it."
[OTH],"Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?"
[OTH],Eight days tomorrow.
[OTH],And I still don't get any action.
[OTH],"I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all."
[OTH],But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.
[OTH],"Well, maybe just one kiss."
[OTH],Mmmmm
Cartman,"Hey, what are you doing?"
[OTH],"Beat it, chubby!"
[OTH],"Go on, Astroturd!"
[OTH],Mmmmm
Cartman,I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
[OTH],Turd Rock From the Sun!
Cartman,Ey! You ate all the pizza!
[OTH],We left you some crusts!
Cartman,"That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass!"
[OTH],"Guess again, Richard the Turd!"
Cartman,Give me that phone number!
[OTH],"Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room."
Cartman,I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick! Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip."
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip."
[OTH],Meowrowrowrowrowrowrowrowr.
[OTH],"Red Rocket spills my icy soul.
Demons from Hell seek the chosen one!"
[OTH],"You're such an amazing poet, Skyler."
[OTH],"Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the best of its kind, and not a scratch on it."
[OTH],"Skyler, not here."
[OTH],I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them.
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff."
[OTH],"O Skyler, I love you."
[OTH],Mmmmm.
[OTH],What the-?
Cartman,"Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!"
[OTH],Give me that picture!
Cartman,Aaaaa! Yes!
[OTH],"Open this door, Turdledove!"
Cartman,I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
[OTH],Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you.
[OTH],"Give me that picture, turd!"
Cartman,You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
[OTH],I'm gonna bust this door down!
Cartman,"What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog?"
[OTH],We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
Cartman,"Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog. Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar. You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me. Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope! That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty!"
[OTH],Meow. Meow.
Cartman,Oh! God dammit!
[OTH],Who is that?!
[OTH],"Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice."
[OTH],"Skyler, your band can't practice here."
[OTH],"Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe! 'Sup Mark? 'Sup up. Jonesy?"
[OTH],Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy.
Cartman,Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
[OTH],Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
Cartman,You just want me to open the door!
[OTH],We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
Cartman,What?? Ih- is she okay?
[OTH],Not really. She's dead.
Cartman,Huh?!
[OTH],Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!
Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!"
[OTH],"HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!"
Cartman,"Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!"
[OTH],You mean this one?
Cartman,"O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, dammit! AAAAH!"
[OTH],"Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly, Shelly."
Cartman,"Aw, man, you guys suck."
[OTH],"Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly."

[OTH],"Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay."
Cartman,Oh my God!
[OTH],They're having a cat orgy!
Cartman,"You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!"
[OTH],Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
Cartman,"Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on. That's it. Come on, come on. Uh oh."
[OTH],"You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you! Umph! Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh! Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!"
[OTH],"Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home. You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends."
Cartman,Yeah. I think we get along okay.
[OTH],"Hi, kids. I'm home."
Cartman,Heh. Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!
[OTH],No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
[OTH],"Oh, what a party that was! Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm."
[OTH],"Wow, she passed out."
Cartman,"Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush."
[OTH],"Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay."
Cartman,That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West.
Cartman,"Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age, wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside. Wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Frog Polly Prissy Pants go down to...
Well... mm-Rumpertumskin."
[OTH],I don't want to go to this stupid party!
[OTH],"Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time."
[OTH],"No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels."
[OTH],"Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it."
[OTH],"Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm."
[OTH],"Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him."
[OTH],"Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement."
[OTH],Awww!
[OTH],"Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflé, and uh, eh, Juanita? Juanita? We need some more finger sandwiches?"
[OTH],I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
[OTH],"Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time."
[OTH],"Here you go, it's right in here."
[OTH],"We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan."
[OTH],Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
[OTH],"You have fun, Stanley."
[OTH],"No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!"
[OTH],We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts.
[OTH],"Cheerio, Stan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here."
[OTH],"Shut up, Pip."
[OTH],"Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however."
[OTH],"Butters, is there any way out of here?"
[OTH],"Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room. Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think."
[OTH],I like math.
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, ""Turrah!"" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar? And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
[OTH],"Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
[OTH],"Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass. No! Mr. Hat, you get back here!"
[OTH],Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
[OTH],"Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol."
[OTH],Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while.
[OTH],"One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little."
[OTH],"Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment."
[OTH],"Yeah, experiment."
[OTH],"Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
[OTH],"Wickersham tally-ho ugh. Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],What are you? A sourpuss?
[OTH],"Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice. Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh? They got those thick noses and all."
[OTH],"Hey, look at this!"
[OTH],Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be.
[OTH],It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.
[OTH],Neato.
[OTH],"Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels."
[OTH],"Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me."
[OTH],"Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?"
[OTH],"No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it."
[OTH],"Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed. Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?"
[OTH],"Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!"
[OTH],Well. Alrighty then.
[OTH],Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.
[OTH],"Wow, neat!"
[OTH],It looks quite inviting.
[OTH],"Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub."
[OTH],"Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut."
[OTH],"Hell, we should get in."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear."
[OTH],"Hm huheh, that's okay."
[OTH],No hot tub for me!
[OTH],"Well, screw you guys!"
[OTH],"I'm getting in for a while, too. Geronimo!"
[OTH],"Oh, look at our boys, Sheila. It's just like they're in college again."
[OTH],"Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?"
[OTH],"Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?"
[OTH],How should I know?
[OTH],"Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission."
[OTH],"Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?"
[OTH],What do I have to do?
[OTH],"Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it."
[OTH],"Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast."
[OTH],"Oh, that's a splendid mission!"
[OTH],"Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels!"
[OTH],Which Angel am I again?
[OTH],"Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?"
[OTH],"Yeah, I know what you mean."
[OTH],"I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things."
[OTH],"Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar. Only 'cause I've never smoked before."
[OTH],Good idea.
[OTH],What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
[OTH],"Hohn. Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me."
[OTH],Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, you mean, this?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Yeah. That, that was me."
[OTH],Bosley! Bosley!
[OTH],"What, Pip?"
[OTH],Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
[OTH],What the hell do you want?!
[OTH],"Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs."
[OTH],You did?
[OTH],Air shaft.
[OTH],"Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown."
[OTH],"So Bosley, what's our next mission?"
[OTH],We're going upstairs.
[OTH],Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
[OTH],"Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs!"
[OTH],"Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot."
[OTH],She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
[OTH],"O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that."
[OTH],I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
[OTH],With two girls or two guys?
[OTH],"Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be..."
[OTH],"You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have."
[OTH],You haven't?
[OTH],"No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?"
[OTH],"Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy."
[OTH],"Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?"
[OTH],"NO, no, uh I don't think so."
[OTH],...Well it is a night for experimenting.
[OTH],Sure is.
[OTH],"Okay, I'll start."
[OTH],This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.
[OTH],Code 7. We believe we have found the compound. Request immediate backup.
[OTH],"Okay, so just what is going on here, people?"
[OTH],Get down!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts."
[OTH],Are you sure?
[OTH],"Of course we're sure! We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our job to know what these fanatics do!"
[OTH],So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
[OTH],"Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them."
[OTH],What's the situation?
[OTH],"Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts."
[OTH],Any luck talking to somebody in the house?
[OTH],"We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir."
[OTH],Alright. Johnson!
[OTH],Sir!
[OTH],I'm sending you in. Watch your ass.
[OTH],"Yes, sir!"
[OTH],"Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay? Would you like a meteor mai tai?"
[OTH],"Heeey, I love mai tais!"
[OTH],"We did it! Great job, Angels!"
[OTH],"So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?"
[OTH],"Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set."
[OTH],"What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?"
[OTH],"I don't care, just hurry!"
[OTH],"Well, hooray!"
[OTH],So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.
[OTH],...Yeah.
[OTH],"Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?"
[OTH],"No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?"
[OTH],Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
[OTH],"Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing."
[OTH],"Hey. Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends."
[OTH],Um... Yeah yeah sure sure.
[OTH],"Damn it, where is Johnson?!"
[OTH],"No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him."
[OTH],Those bastards!
[OTH],"Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much."
[OTH],"Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?"
[OTH],"We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again."
[OTH],"Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay?"
[OTH],"Hold it right there! Whatever it is you are intending to do, do not do it! Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot- God damn it, who was that?! Did you see them move?!"
[OTH],...I did.
[OTH],Yah.
[OTH],"Yeah, they moved alright."
[OTH],"Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year."
[OTH],"Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now?"
[OTH],I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?"
[OTH],...What??
[OTH],"Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself."
[OTH],Well... Let's go kick his ass!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Where is he?!
[OTH],"Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida."
[OTH],Aw!
[OTH],"Hey, Randy. What are you doing?"
[OTH],Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
[OTH],Can I come with you?
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea. Uh I got to thinkin', ""Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?"" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was."
[OTH],Rad!
[OTH],"Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?"
[OTH],There are no more missions. I have everything I want.
[OTH],Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
[OTH],Just... play something else! God!
[OTH],Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts."
[OTH],"Whoa, cool!"
[OTH],I wanna be a reporter someday.
[OTH],"Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house. According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued."
[OTH],"Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits."
[OTH],The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks. The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.
[OTH],Wait a minute Oh my God! Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
[OTH],Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
[OTH],We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards!
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?"
[OTH],"Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission."
[OTH],"Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you."
[OTH],I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
[OTH],"So, so now we can't be friends?"
[OTH],"I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody."
[OTH],We said we'd never tell anybody?
[OTH],"Well, of course we wouldn't."
[OTH],"Oh, uh I didn't realize that."
[OTH],"Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?"
[OTH],"Well, uh uh a few people, yeah."
[OTH],What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
[OTH],You didn't say not to tell anyone.
[OTH],"Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody!"
[OTH],Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
[OTH],AAAW!!
[OTH],Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them.
[OTH],"Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?"
[OTH],"Mom, go look outside."
[OTH],Mommy's little boopie-kins
[OTH],"Uh let me handle this, Stan. Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya!"
[OTH],"Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves."
[OTH],Lay down your weapons!
[OTH],We don't have any weapons.
[OTH],"Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Get back inside!
[OTH],I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique.
[OTH],What's the Ganz technique?
[OTH],"This is what we did in Waco. Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out. Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will."
[OTH],"That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?"
[OTH],Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
[OTH],"Well, hell, turn it up."
[OTH],"Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay."
[OTH],"Oh, is he?"
[OTH],Who?!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Who who did you hear is, is gay?!"
[OTH],"Ricky Martin, the singer."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Hey, Randy, what's up?"
[OTH],What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
[OTH],Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
[OTH],There's nothing to talk about.
[OTH],"You're having regrets, aren't you?"
[OTH],"No, I-... I don't know."
[OTH],Hey. Talk to me.
[OTH],No!
[OTH],I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
[OTH],Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
[OTH],"Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do."
[OTH],"Aaww! Sharon? Sharon, cuh can we go?"
[OTH],Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
[OTH],"Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now."
[OTH],"Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!"
[OTH],"Ogh, I already did."
[OTH],"Dad! Dad, they shot at us."
[OTH],"Not now, Stanley."
[OTH],Mom!
[OTH],Whoopee!
[OTH],"Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families."
[OTH],"Get a hold of yourself, man!"
[OTH],"How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?"
[OTH],Come on. We have to find out what's happening.
[OTH],"I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?"
[OTH],"We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now."
[OTH],See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
[OTH],"So what are your plans, commander?"
[OTH],"Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out."
[OTH],"Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-"
[OTH],Sh!
[OTH],"Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander."
[OTH],"It is, but we can't let them kill themselves."
[OTH],We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
[OTH],But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
[OTH],"Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on."
[OTH],"Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real."
[OTH],"For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out."
[OTH],"Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay?"
[OTH],"This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party. As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us. Anything else?"
[OTH],Tell them not to burn us down.
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news."
[OTH],Now what do we do?
[OTH],Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
[OTH],"Hey, I'm a real reporter."
[OTH],"You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job."
[OTH],"Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs. Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator!"
[OTH],"Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?"
[OTH],We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.
[OTH],"Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves."
[OTH],Look. You see this? You see this?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"You see it? You see it? Go get it. Go get it! Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!"
[OTH],Having a good time?
[OTH],"Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?"
[OTH],"I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-"
[OTH],"We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay!"
[OTH],"Good night, everyone."
[OTH],"Look out! Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm. People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender!"
[OTH],"Oh no, we're out of time! Are you sure you can do this, Butters?"
[OTH],"Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?"
[OTH],"We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there."
[OTH],Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
[OTH],"Can you hit a target, Pip?"
[OTH],I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire.
[OTH],Hit something nice and solid now.
[OTH],I think that's got it.
[OTH],"Nice job, Pip."
[OTH],Did I do a nice job? Really?
[OTH],"Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn."
[OTH],"Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now. Waaah! Gooh."
[OTH],He made it down.
[OTH],"Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command!"
[OTH],"Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir."
[OTH],Honey?
[OTH],"God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows."
[OTH],Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
[OTH],What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
[OTH],I just want to know it meant something to you.
[OTH],"It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry! All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub!"
[OTH],"Aw, I was just in the hot tub."
[OTH],"Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares! We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!"
[OTH],"Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it."
[OTH],Mmm-me too.
[OTH],"Yeah, uh I've done it a few times."
[OTH],Yep.
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],"Myeup, me too."
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],"Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here."
[OTH],"Uh, Juanita, could you fix some more dip, please, Juanita?"
[OTH],You mean it? I'm not gay?
[OTH],Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
[OTH],"Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!"
[OTH],So we're friends again?
[OTH],"Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!"
[OTH],"Alright everyone, fire!"
[OTH],"Hold on just a minute! This is Derek Smalls reporting. We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house , proving that the people inside are not cultists after all."
[OTH],"Uh oh. Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation."
[OTH],Simulation?
[OTH],Sh. All is well. Do not shoot at
[OTH],"O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day!"
[OTH],Woops.
[OTH],"Sir, this isn't gonna look good."
[OTH],"You're right. Quick, let's get out of here!"
[OTH],"Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys."
[OTH],"Wow, you mean that?"
[OTH],"Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams."
[OTH],"Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!"
[OTH],"There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job."
[OTH],"Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya."
[OTH],"But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along."
[OTH],"Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?"
[OTH],Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
[OTH],You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
[OTH],"Hoh, dude, weak."
[OTH],Super weak.
[OTH],Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me.
[OTH],I don't want to go to this stupid party!
[OTH],"Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time."
[OTH],"No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels."
[OTH],"Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it."
[OTH],"Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm."
[OTH],"Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him."
[OTH],"Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement."
[OTH],Awww!
[OTH],"Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflé, and uh, eh, Juanita? Juanita? We need some more finger sandwiches?"
[OTH],I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
[OTH],"Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time."
[OTH],"Here you go, it's right in here."
[OTH],"We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan."
[OTH],Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
[OTH],"You have fun, Stanley."
[OTH],"No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!"
[OTH],We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts.
[OTH],"Cheerio, Stan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here."
[OTH],"Shut up, Pip."
[OTH],"Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however."
[OTH],"Butters, is there any way out of here?"
[OTH],"Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room. Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think."
[OTH],I like math.
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, ""Turrah!"" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar? And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
[OTH],"Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
[OTH],"Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass. No! Mr. Hat, you get back here!"
[OTH],Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
[OTH],"Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol."
[OTH],Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while.
[OTH],"One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little."
[OTH],"Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment."
[OTH],"Yeah, experiment."
[OTH],"Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
[OTH],"Wickersham tally-ho ugh. Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],What are you? A sourpuss?
[OTH],"Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice. Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh? They got those thick noses and all."
[OTH],"Hey, look at this!"
[OTH],Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be.
[OTH],It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.
[OTH],Neato.
[OTH],"Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels."
[OTH],"Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me."
[OTH],"Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?"
[OTH],"No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it."
[OTH],"Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed. Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?"
[OTH],"Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!"
[OTH],Well. Alrighty then.
[OTH],Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.
[OTH],"Wow, neat!"
[OTH],It looks quite inviting.
[OTH],"Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub."
[OTH],"Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut."
[OTH],"Hell, we should get in."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear."
[OTH],"Hm huheh, that's okay."
[OTH],No hot tub for me!
[OTH],"Well, screw you guys!"
[OTH],"I'm getting in for a while, too. Geronimo!"
[OTH],"Oh, look at our boys, Sheila. It's just like they're in college again."
[OTH],"Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?"
[OTH],"Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?"
[OTH],How should I know?
[OTH],"Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission."
[OTH],"Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?"
[OTH],What do I have to do?
[OTH],"Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it."
[OTH],"Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast."
[OTH],"Oh, that's a splendid mission!"
[OTH],"Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels!"
[OTH],Which Angel am I again?
[OTH],"Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?"
[OTH],"Yeah, I know what you mean."
[OTH],"I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things."
[OTH],"Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar. Only 'cause I've never smoked before."
[OTH],Good idea.
[OTH],What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
[OTH],"Hohn. Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me."
[OTH],Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, you mean, this?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Yeah. That, that was me."
[OTH],Bosley! Bosley!
[OTH],"What, Pip?"
[OTH],Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
[OTH],What the hell do you want?!
[OTH],"Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs."
[OTH],You did?
[OTH],Air shaft.
[OTH],"Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown."
[OTH],"So Bosley, what's our next mission?"
[OTH],We're going upstairs.
[OTH],Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
[OTH],"Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs!"
[OTH],"Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot."
[OTH],She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
[OTH],"O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that."
[OTH],I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
[OTH],With two girls or two guys?
[OTH],"Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be..."
[OTH],"You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have."
[OTH],You haven't?
[OTH],"No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?"
[OTH],"Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy."
[OTH],"Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?"
[OTH],"NO, no, uh I don't think so."
[OTH],...Well it is a night for experimenting.
[OTH],Sure is.
[OTH],"Okay, I'll start."
[OTH],This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.
[OTH],Code 7. We believe we have found the compound. Request immediate backup.
[OTH],"Okay, so just what is going on here, people?"
[OTH],Get down!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts."
[OTH],Are you sure?
[OTH],"Of course we're sure! We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our job to know what these fanatics do!"
[OTH],So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
[OTH],"Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them."
[OTH],What's the situation?
[OTH],"Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts."
[OTH],Any luck talking to somebody in the house?
[OTH],"We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir."
[OTH],Alright. Johnson!
[OTH],Sir!
[OTH],I'm sending you in. Watch your ass.
[OTH],"Yes, sir!"
[OTH],"Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay? Would you like a meteor mai tai?"
[OTH],"Heeey, I love mai tais!"
[OTH],"We did it! Great job, Angels!"
[OTH],"So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?"
[OTH],"Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set."
[OTH],"What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?"
[OTH],"I don't care, just hurry!"
[OTH],"Well, hooray!"
[OTH],So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.
[OTH],...Yeah.
[OTH],"Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?"
[OTH],"No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?"
[OTH],Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
[OTH],"Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing."
[OTH],"Hey. Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends."
[OTH],Um... Yeah yeah sure sure.
[OTH],"Damn it, where is Johnson?!"
[OTH],"No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him."
[OTH],Those bastards!
[OTH],"Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much."
[OTH],"Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?"
[OTH],"We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again."
[OTH],"Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay?"
[OTH],"Hold it right there! Whatever it is you are intending to do, do not do it! Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot- God damn it, who was that?! Did you see them move?!"
[OTH],...I did.
[OTH],Yah.
[OTH],"Yeah, they moved alright."
[OTH],"Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year."
[OTH],"Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now?"
[OTH],I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?"
[OTH],...What??
[OTH],"Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself."
[OTH],Well... Let's go kick his ass!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Where is he?!
[OTH],"Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida."
[OTH],Aw!
[OTH],"Hey, Randy. What are you doing?"
[OTH],Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
[OTH],Can I come with you?
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea. Uh I got to thinkin', ""Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?"" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was."
[OTH],Rad!
[OTH],"Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?"
[OTH],There are no more missions. I have everything I want.
[OTH],Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
[OTH],Just... play something else! God!
[OTH],Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts."
[OTH],"Whoa, cool!"
[OTH],I wanna be a reporter someday.
[OTH],"Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house. According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued."
[OTH],"Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits."
[OTH],The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks. The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.
[OTH],Wait a minute Oh my God! Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
[OTH],Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
[OTH],We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards!
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?"
[OTH],"Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission."
[OTH],"Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you."
[OTH],I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
[OTH],"So, so now we can't be friends?"
[OTH],"I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody."
[OTH],We said we'd never tell anybody?
[OTH],"Well, of course we wouldn't."
[OTH],"Oh, uh I didn't realize that."
[OTH],"Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?"
[OTH],"Well, uh uh a few people, yeah."
[OTH],What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
[OTH],You didn't say not to tell anyone.
[OTH],"Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody!"
[OTH],Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
[OTH],AAAW!!
[OTH],Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them.
[OTH],"Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?"
[OTH],"Mom, go look outside."
[OTH],Mommy's little boopie-kins
[OTH],"Uh let me handle this, Stan. Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya!"
[OTH],"Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves."
[OTH],Lay down your weapons!
[OTH],We don't have any weapons.
[OTH],"Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Get back inside!
[OTH],I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique.
[OTH],What's the Ganz technique?
[OTH],"This is what we did in Waco. Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out. Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will."
[OTH],"That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?"
[OTH],Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
[OTH],"Well, hell, turn it up."
[OTH],"Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay."
[OTH],"Oh, is he?"
[OTH],Who?!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Who who did you hear is, is gay?!"
[OTH],"Ricky Martin, the singer."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Hey, Randy, what's up?"
[OTH],What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
[OTH],Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
[OTH],There's nothing to talk about.
[OTH],"You're having regrets, aren't you?"
[OTH],"No, I-... I don't know."
[OTH],Hey. Talk to me.
[OTH],No!
[OTH],I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
[OTH],Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
[OTH],"Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do."
[OTH],"Aaww! Sharon? Sharon, cuh can we go?"
[OTH],Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
[OTH],"Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now."
[OTH],"Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!"
[OTH],"Ogh, I already did."
[OTH],"Dad! Dad, they shot at us."
[OTH],"Not now, Stanley."
[OTH],Mom!
[OTH],Whoopee!
[OTH],"Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families."
[OTH],"Get a hold of yourself, man!"
[OTH],"How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?"
[OTH],Come on. We have to find out what's happening.
[OTH],"I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?"
[OTH],"We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now."
[OTH],See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
[OTH],"So what are your plans, commander?"
[OTH],"Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out."
[OTH],"Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-"
[OTH],Sh!
[OTH],"Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander."
[OTH],"It is, but we can't let them kill themselves."
[OTH],We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
[OTH],But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
[OTH],"Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on."
[OTH],"Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real."
[OTH],"For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out."
[OTH],"Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay?"
[OTH],"This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party. As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us. Anything else?"
[OTH],Tell them not to burn us down.
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news."
[OTH],Now what do we do?
[OTH],Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
[OTH],"Hey, I'm a real reporter."
[OTH],"You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job."
[OTH],"Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs. Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator!"
[OTH],"Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?"
[OTH],We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.
[OTH],"Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves."
[OTH],Look. You see this? You see this?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"You see it? You see it? Go get it. Go get it! Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!"
[OTH],Having a good time?
[OTH],"Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?"
[OTH],"I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-"
[OTH],"We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay!"
[OTH],"Good night, everyone."
[OTH],"Look out! Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm. People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender!"
[OTH],"Oh no, we're out of time! Are you sure you can do this, Butters?"
[OTH],"Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?"
[OTH],"We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there."
[OTH],Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
[OTH],"Can you hit a target, Pip?"
[OTH],I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire.
[OTH],Hit something nice and solid now.
[OTH],I think that's got it.
[OTH],"Nice job, Pip."
[OTH],Did I do a nice job? Really?
[OTH],"Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn."
[OTH],"Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now. Waaah! Gooh."
[OTH],He made it down.
[OTH],"Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command!"
[OTH],"Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir."
[OTH],Honey?
[OTH],"God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows."
[OTH],Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
[OTH],What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
[OTH],I just want to know it meant something to you.
[OTH],"It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry! All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub!"
[OTH],"Aw, I was just in the hot tub."
[OTH],"Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares! We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!"
[OTH],"Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it."
[OTH],Mmm-me too.
[OTH],"Yeah, uh I've done it a few times."
[OTH],Yep.
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],"Myeup, me too."
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],"Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here."
[OTH],"Uh, Juanita, could you fix some more dip, please, Juanita?"
[OTH],You mean it? I'm not gay?
[OTH],Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
[OTH],"Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!"
[OTH],So we're friends again?
[OTH],"Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!"
[OTH],"Alright everyone, fire!"
[OTH],"Hold on just a minute! This is Derek Smalls reporting. We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house , proving that the people inside are not cultists after all."
[OTH],"Uh oh. Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation."
[OTH],Simulation?
[OTH],Sh. All is well. Do not shoot at
[OTH],"O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day!"
[OTH],Woops.
[OTH],"Sir, this isn't gonna look good."
[OTH],"You're right. Quick, let's get out of here!"
[OTH],"Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys."
[OTH],"Wow, you mean that?"
[OTH],"Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams."
[OTH],"Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!"
[OTH],"There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job."
[OTH],"Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya."
[OTH],"But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along."
[OTH],"Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?"
[OTH],Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
[OTH],You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
[OTH],"Hoh, dude, weak."
[OTH],Super weak.
[OTH],Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me.
[OTH],"Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?"
[OTH],"I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!"
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],"I'm coming, Ma!"
[OTH],"Go get the door, Kyle!"
[OTH],"""Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind!"
[OTH],"Oh! Hey, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)"
[OTH],"I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee."
[OTH],(What's that?)
[OTH],"It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure."
[OTH],"(Oh, that's alright.)"
[OTH],Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
[OTH],(Really?)
[OTH],Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
[OTH],"...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing."
[OTH],...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
[OTH],(Aw.)
[OTH],"No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids."
[OTH],"You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout."
[OTH],Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"Kyle, eh, the problem is..."
[OTH],"Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight."
[OTH],"Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?"
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Come on, Ike! It's time to go to Squirts!"
[OTH],(Squirts?)
[OTH],You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
[OTH],(Oh.)
[OTH],"Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there."
[OTH],"And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, ""Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."""
[OTH],(Uh huh.)
[OTH],"Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it."
[OTH],(Uh huh!)
[OTH],Eng jeck.
[OTH],"No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!"
[OTH],"Ike, you behave!"
[OTH],Buwor?
[OTH],"No, Ike!"
[OTH],Buh buh buh buh.
[OTH],I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
[OTH],"Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout."
[OTH],No-o.
[OTH],"Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle."
[OTH],What? You want me to lie?
[OTH],"Yeah, lie."
[OTH],"Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--"
[OTH],"Oh my God, what is that?!"
[OTH],"Hey, it's a bear!"
[OTH],"Wow, cool."
[OTH],"This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?"
[OTH],Welcome to Jewbilee. You folks find it okay?
[OTH],"Yeah. Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back."
[OTH],He was huge.
[OTH],"Yeah. We spotted him a few days ago. Nothing to worry about, though. Your boys are safe with us."
[OTH],I'm sure they are.
[OTH],"We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys."
[OTH],"Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?"
[OTH],(Uh huh?)
[OTH],Try and act Jewish.
[OTH],(How do you do that?)
[OTH],"Come on, Squirt! We're meeting over here!"
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts."
[OTH],"You have to go with him, Ike."
[OTH],Buh buh buh buh.
[OTH],"Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building."
[OTH],Boul ball.
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],Name?
[OTH],Kyle Broflovski.
[OTH],(Kenny McCormick.)
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg."
[OTH],"Alright, get to Meshuggeneh Hall! The meeting is already starting."
[OTH],(What's that?)
[OTH],This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
[OTH],"Baleilah hazein, Hame kadesh mekoh hikenazu puanazikeh hakeilah. (Now gather us, the elders, on this most holy of nights.)"
[OTH],"Helalelah, het Moshe. (Praise Moses.)"
[OTH],"I want to welcome you all. Though we each come from a different sect of Judaism, on this night of Jewbilee, we all pray to Moses as one. Hineinih kureh leirukeshu. (May all the power of Moses show the way...) Now, let us all introduce ourselves."
[OTH],"Elder Carn, from the Orthodox synagogue."
[OTH],"Elder Harris, from the Hasidic sect."
[OTH],"Elder Garth, from the synagogue of anti-Semites."
[OTH],I don't believe I've heard of the anti-Semitic sect of Judaism before.
[OTH],We're new.
[OTH],"Okay, Squirts, the elders have given us a very important task tonight. We are all going to make macaroni pictures, like this one, using dry macaroni, paper, and glue."
[OTH],How come we have to make macaroni pictures?
[OTH],"Because that's what Squirts do! Now, shut your pie-hole!"
[OTH],What's your name?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],How come your head is lookin' so... funny-looking?
[OTH],Uh-uh.
[OTH],"And that's how we'll be making tonight's craft. And so you see, Scouts, all you need is a bar of soap and a dull knife , and you can make nifty soap sculptures like these. Here's a giraffe. And here's a cloud. You can all pick up your bars of soap later on, as we will all be making soap sculptures tonight. Now, this year we are pleased to announce that Jewbilee has grown to over one hundred Jew Scouts from all around the country. All new inductees, raise your hands."
[OTH],"That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand."
[OTH],"Uhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man?"
[OTH],Junichi.
[OTH],"O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um... Cu-could you run out and grab some... some of those candles for us? There we go. Ahem. Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please."
[OTH],"This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up."
[OTH],Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
[OTH],I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
[OTH],"My honor, wide and true."
[OTH],"My honor, wide and true."
[OTH],I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
[OTH],I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
[OTH],"Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew."
[OTH],"Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew."
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],(Nahit chaim.) (Ha! Hiheh haha.) (Hah! Oh my God!)
[OTH],"Okay, Squirts, let's see what you made macaroni pictures of. Ishmael?"
[OTH],Apple.
[OTH],Good. Matthew?
[OTH],Cat.
[OTH],Joseph?
[OTH],Triangle.
[OTH],Okay. Ike?
[OTH],Cokeshen.
[OTH],"...You don't make a macaroni picture of the Last Supper at a Jewish camp! What the geez? Oh my God, it's that bear they've been talking about! Where did it go?! Squirts, go grab your gear! We're gonna hunt us a bear! Then I'll get my chutzpah badge for sure!"
[OTH],"Elehem hav dorim, ashoseveh laoleinu. Hakadosh boruku, omasheh hachreit. (Tonight, for the meteor shower, we will pray to Moses. Then we will give Moses thanks.)"
[OTH],"Oh, enough already. What has Moses ever done for us?"
[OTH],All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses.
[OTH],"Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it--"
[OTH],"Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!"
[OTH],"All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews."
[OTH],"We pray to Moses here, elder."
[OTH],"If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!"
[OTH],"We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!"
[OTH],"Fine! Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see! You will see this very night!"
[OTH],Hello.
[OTH],"Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle."
[OTH],(What the fuck are we doing?)
[OTH],This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
[OTH],"(Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)"
[OTH],"It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!"
[OTH],"Alright, Jew Scouts, the meteor shower will start soon. Let's pray to Moses for guidance. Moses, great leader, on this blessed night of Jewbilee, we ask for your tutelage."
[OTH],May the teachings of Moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively.
[OTH],O...
[OTH],"Stupid assholes. Moses ain't gonna teach them anything! Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth."
[OTH],"We are Squirts, we are Squirts; we're so kosher that it hurtsWhen we get older we'll be Scouts, but until then we are Squirts There he is, Squirts. Okay, Squirts. Remember the plan: immobilize and attack. Matthew, y-you immobilize the bear with the net, then Echo team, run up and attack it with your Squirt knives. Don't get too close now, just close enough to throw the net on the stupid bear. Now!"
[OTH],"Oh, funt. No!"
[OTH],"Oh, no! Oh, God! Oh, the bear took a Squirt. Oh, I'm gonna get it now!"
[OTH],O...
[OTH],(What's happening now?)
[OTH],"Shh. Shut up, Kenny."
[OTH],(What the fuck is that?!)
[OTH],"That's Moses, stupid!"
[OTH],"Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming."
[OTH],The hour of Jewbilee is near. Let all debts be forgiven and all slaves freed. Mwaaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],Aaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],"Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased."
[OTH],It's a duck.
[OTH],"""And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith."" Conch shell, like this one, hnee."
[OTH],"Moses, the Squirts have made you tidings of macaroni pictures. They should be here any second. Where the hell are the Squirts? We need those macaroni pictures for Moses right now!"
[OTH],"Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison. Well now, that'll be enough to kill a stupid bear. Okay, raise the tray! Chutzpah badge, here I come. Yikes! Okay, here he comes. Easy now. Easy, Squirts. Okay, Squirt, lower the tray. That's it. That's it, you god-damned stupid bearface!"
[OTH],Agghhh! Ah--! Agghhh!
[OTH],"Jesus! Hell, he got another Squirt!"
[OTH],Mommy.
[OTH],"You think you can stop me from getting my chutzpah badge, you stupid bear?! Think again!"
[OTH],"Kumbaya, my Lord, KumbayaO Lord, Kumbaya"
[OTH],"Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children?"
[OTH],I desire... I desire... macaroni pictures.
[OTH],"Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people?"
[OTH],I desire... popcorn necklaces.
[OTH],"You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away! All you need is some popcorn, and a needle and thread."
[OTH],Hold! There is... an impurity.
[OTH],"Oh no, he's on to me, Haman."
[OTH],"An impurity, Moses?"
[OTH],This child here is not kosher.
[OTH],"(Uh-oh.) (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)"
[OTH],Don't worry. I know what to do.
[OTH],"Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?!"
[OTH],"Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish."
[OTH],(What?!)
[OTH],A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with!
[OTH],"(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)"
[OTH],You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake.
[OTH],(What?!)
[OTH],He doesn't get cake?
[OTH],No cake for the impurity.
[OTH],Go now. You do not belong here.
[OTH],Aaggghhh!

[OTH],He's reading from the Book of Haman!
[OTH],"Enter the conch shell, Moses!"
[OTH],Eo! Eh! Diu!
[OTH],"And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity!"
[OTH],"Elder, what have you done?"
[OTH],"I told you, the meteor shower is the time of Haman! I am running Jewbilee now!"
[OTH],"Release Moses, now!"
[OTH],I don't think so.
[OTH],When do we get to eat carrot cake?
[OTH],"Now... All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand!"
[OTH],"Elder, you cannot mean--"
[OTH],"Move! Now! Now, Haman, your time has come!"
[OTH],"Dude, what the hell is going on?!"
[OTH],"If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed."
[OTH],(Oh no!)
[OTH],"We are Jew Squirts, we know JewishStick stick smiley smiley Stick stick smiley smileydur dur dur dur dur--Hold it, Squirts! This is where we'll set our trap. Everyone remember your squadron. Alpha-5 and Gamma-7 will be on recon teams. Alpha will take left flank and flush the bear out of sector three. Once we're in position, I want constant contact between all squad leaders. We'll flush him out and we'll attack him!"
[OTH],Agh! Agghh!
[OTH],"Remember, this is only a bear. All we have to do is stick together, and we can spend the rest of the night making bear sandwiches! Where's Zigmal?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"God-damnit! You stupid god-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?!"
[OTH],And the Ancient One looked upon Haman as the new leader of the people! And it was the night that stars flew around the sky! Yes! Yess!!
[OTH],"If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear."
[OTH],I wanna go home.
[OTH],"(Stop!) (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!) (Shit!)"
[OTH],"That bear thinks he can outsmart me! Well, I'm not gonna let a stupid bear get the-- Hold! Look over there! It's one of the Squirts the bear took. Maybe he's okay. It's a trap!! Damn! Damn, damn, damn! Okay, bear, that does it! You wanna kill all the Squirts?! You can have 'em! I give up! I don't need my chutzpah badge, or Jew Scouts, or any of this crap! Forget it!"
[OTH],Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"We await your return, Haman! Your passage is safe from the enemies!"
[OTH],(Aghh!)
[OTH],It's hopeless.
[OTH],"Haman will be summoned and we will be forced to obey him, or die."
[OTH],Uh I'm fine with obeying.
[OTH],"Yeah, obeying should work out swell."
[OTH],"Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us."
[OTH],How?
[OTH],Kenny will find a way.
[OTH],(Haaarrrrrh!) (Huh?)
[OTH],"Hey, welcome to the party. See this li'l bear cub? It's his birthday."
[OTH],"Yeah, so his mommy brought us all over to play with him."

[OTH],"Come on, Squirts. We have to help them."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Elder Schwartz, I lost the Squirts! I lost all the Squirts! Well, screw you too! I don't need your Chutzpah badge anyway! Hello?"
[OTH],"Shlomo, get us out of here!"
[OTH],What the geez? What are you guys doing in there?
[OTH],Get the keys and unlock the door!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Get the keys and unlock the door!
[OTH],I lost the Squirts!
[OTH],Look out!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Don't move!
[OTH],"Oh, Jiminy gravy, what is this??"
[OTH],"It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh!"
[OTH],You can't wake Haman. What would Moses say?
[OTH],Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith!
[OTH],"Oh, no you don't! Ooowww!!"
[OTH],Enough of this waste of time! Haman! The Great Summoning is done! Upon these words let your spirit come! Einich! Hos!
[OTH],It is lost.
[OTH],Zayak. Kareem!
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Hey, give that back!"
[OTH],It's the Squirts.
[OTH],"Go, Ike!"
[OTH],"Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys are up there."
[OTH],They'll never reach.
[OTH],"Squirts, fall in. Chinese formation."
[OTH],Give me that book!

[OTH],Look!

[OTH],Die!
[OTH],No! Aaagghhh! Ooww..!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Kenny!
[OTH],That blow to his head must have killed him.
[OTH],He saved us. He saved all the Jews.
[OTH],"You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass."
[OTH],"We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny."
[OTH],Every year we shall gather here in this special place and bring Kenny tidings of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures.
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],And those little shaker things where... you put beans inside of paper plates that are glued together.
[OTH],Paper-plate bean shakers.
[OTH],And let us put patterns of glue on the outside of those paper plates so we can then pour glitter on them so they can look nice and sparkly.
[OTH],"You heard him, Scouts! Let's get to work!"
[OTH],"Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?"
[OTH],"I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!"

[OTH],"Uhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man?"
[OTH],Junichi.
[OTH],"O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um... Cu-could you run out and grab some... some of those candles for us? There we go. Ahem. Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please."
[OTH],"This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up."
[OTH],Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
[OTH],I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
[OTH],"My honor, wide and true."
[OTH],"My honor, wide and true."
[OTH],I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
[OTH],I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
[OTH],"Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew."
[OTH],"Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew."
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],Nahit chaim.
[OTH],(Nahit chaim.) (Ha! Hiheh haha.) (Hah! Oh my God!)
[OTH],"Okay, Squirts, let's see what you made macaroni pictures of. Ishmael?"
[OTH],Apple.
[OTH],Good. Matthew?
[OTH],Cat.
[OTH],Joseph?
[OTH],Triangle.
[OTH],Okay. Ike?
[OTH],Cokeshen.
[OTH],"...You don't make a macaroni picture of the Last Supper at a Jewish camp! What the geez? Oh my God, it's that bear they've been talking about! Where did it go?! Squirts, go grab your gear! We're gonna hunt us a bear! Then I'll get my chutzpah badge for sure!"
[OTH],"Elehem hav dorim, ashoseveh laoleinu. Hakadosh boruku, omasheh hachreit. (Tonight, for the meteor shower, we will pray to Moses. Then we will give Moses thanks.)"
[OTH],"Oh, enough already. What has Moses ever done for us?"
[OTH],All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses.
[OTH],"Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it--"
[OTH],"Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!"
[OTH],"All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews."
[OTH],"We pray to Moses here, elder."
[OTH],"If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!"
[OTH],"We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!"
[OTH],"Fine! Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see! You will see this very night!"
[OTH],Hello.
[OTH],"Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle."
[OTH],(What the fuck are we doing?)
[OTH],This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
[OTH],"(Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)"
[OTH],"It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!"
[OTH],"Alright, Jew Scouts, the meteor shower will start soon. Let's pray to Moses for guidance. Moses, great leader, on this blessed night of Jewbilee, we ask for your tutelage."
[OTH],May the teachings of Moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively.
[OTH],O...
[OTH],"Stupid assholes. Moses ain't gonna teach them anything! Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth."
[OTH],"We are Squirts, we are Squirts; we're so kosher that it hurtsWhen we get older we'll be Scouts, but until then we are Squirts There he is, Squirts. Okay, Squirts. Remember the plan: immobilize and attack. Matthew, y-you immobilize the bear with the net, then Echo team, run up and attack it with your Squirt knives. Don't get too close now, just close enough to throw the net on the stupid bear. Now!"
[OTH],"Oh, funt. No!"
[OTH],"Oh, no! Oh, God! Oh, the bear took a Squirt. Oh, I'm gonna get it now!"
[OTH],O...
[OTH],(What's happening now?)
[OTH],"Shh. Shut up, Kenny."
[OTH],(What the fuck is that?!)
[OTH],"That's Moses, stupid!"
[OTH],"Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming."
[OTH],The hour of Jewbilee is near. Let all debts be forgiven and all slaves freed. Mwaaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],Aaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],"Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased."
[OTH],It's a duck.
[OTH],"""And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith."" Conch shell, like this one, hnee."
[OTH],"Moses, the Squirts have made you tidings of macaroni pictures. They should be here any second. Where the hell are the Squirts? We need those macaroni pictures for Moses right now!"
[OTH],"Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison. Well now, that'll be enough to kill a stupid bear. Okay, raise the tray! Chutzpah badge, here I come. Yikes! Okay, here he comes. Easy now. Easy, Squirts. Okay, Squirt, lower the tray. That's it. That's it, you god-damned stupid bearface!"
[OTH],Agghhh! Ah--! Agghhh!
[OTH],"Jesus! Hell, he got another Squirt!"
[OTH],Mommy.
[OTH],"You think you can stop me from getting my chutzpah badge, you stupid bear?! Think again!"
[OTH],"Kumbaya, my Lord, KumbayaO Lord, Kumbaya"
[OTH],"Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children?"
[OTH],I desire... I desire... macaroni pictures.
[OTH],"Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people?"
[OTH],I desire... popcorn necklaces.
[OTH],"You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away! All you need is some popcorn, and a needle and thread."
[OTH],Hold! There is... an impurity.
[OTH],"Oh no, he's on to me, Haman."
[OTH],"An impurity, Moses?"
[OTH],This child here is not kosher.
[OTH],"(Uh-oh.) (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)"
[OTH],Don't worry. I know what to do.
[OTH],"Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?!"
[OTH],"Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish."
[OTH],(What?!)
[OTH],A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with!
[OTH],"(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)"
[OTH],You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake.
[OTH],(What?!)
[OTH],He doesn't get cake?
[OTH],No cake for the impurity.
[OTH],Go now. You do not belong here.
[OTH],Aaggghhh!
[OTH],Infatu camdavid. David hakum ba'ikan shtud!
[OTH],"Elder, what are you doing?!"
[OTH],Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht!
[OTH],He's reading from the Book of Haman!
[OTH],"Enter the conch shell, Moses!"
[OTH],Eo! Eh! Diu!
[OTH],"And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity!"
[OTH],"Elder, what have you done?"
[OTH],"I told you, the meteor shower is the time of Haman! I am running Jewbilee now!"
[OTH],"Release Moses, now!"
[OTH],I don't think so.
[OTH],When do we get to eat carrot cake?
[OTH],"Now... All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand!"
[OTH],"Elder, you cannot mean--"
[OTH],"Move! Now! Now, Haman, your time has come!"
[OTH],"Dude, what the hell is going on?!"
[OTH],"If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed."
[OTH],(Oh no!)
[OTH],"We are Jew Squirts, we know JewishStick stick smiley smiley Stick stick smiley smileydur dur dur dur dur--Hold it, Squirts! This is where we'll set our trap. Everyone remember your squadron. Alpha-5 and Gamma-7 will be on recon teams. Alpha will take left flank and flush the bear out of sector three. Once we're in position, I want constant contact between all squad leaders. We'll flush him out and we'll attack him!"
[OTH],Agh! Agghh!
[OTH],"Remember, this is only a bear. All we have to do is stick together, and we can spend the rest of the night making bear sandwiches! Where's Zigmal?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"God-damnit! You stupid god-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?!"
[OTH],And the Ancient One looked upon Haman as the new leader of the people! And it was the night that stars flew around the sky! Yes! Yess!!
[OTH],"If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear."
[OTH],I wanna go home.
[OTH],"(Stop!) (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!) (Shit!)"
[OTH],"That bear thinks he can outsmart me! Well, I'm not gonna let a stupid bear get the-- Hold! Look over there! It's one of the Squirts the bear took. Maybe he's okay. It's a trap!! Damn! Damn, damn, damn! Okay, bear, that does it! You wanna kill all the Squirts?! You can have 'em! I give up! I don't need my chutzpah badge, or Jew Scouts, or any of this crap! Forget it!"
[OTH],Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"We await your return, Haman! Your passage is safe from the enemies!"
[OTH],(Aghh!)
[OTH],It's hopeless.
[OTH],"Haman will be summoned and we will be forced to obey him, or die."
[OTH],Uh I'm fine with obeying.
[OTH],"Yeah, obeying should work out swell."
[OTH],"Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us."
[OTH],How?
[OTH],Kenny will find a way.
[OTH],(Haaarrrrrh!) (Huh?)
[OTH],"Hey, welcome to the party. See this li'l bear cub? It's his birthday."
[OTH],"Yeah, so his mommy brought us all over to play with him."
[OTH],Mrar.
[OTH],"(Aww.) (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... )"
[OTH],They are? Uh oh.
[OTH],"(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)"
[OTH],"Come on, Squirts. We have to help them."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Elder Schwartz, I lost the Squirts! I lost all the Squirts! Well, screw you too! I don't need your Chutzpah badge anyway! Hello?"
[OTH],"Shlomo, get us out of here!"
[OTH],What the geez? What are you guys doing in there?
[OTH],Get the keys and unlock the door!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Get the keys and unlock the door!
[OTH],I lost the Squirts!
[OTH],Look out!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Don't move!
[OTH],"Oh, Jiminy gravy, what is this??"
[OTH],"It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh!"
[OTH],You can't wake Haman. What would Moses say?
[OTH],Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith!
[OTH],"Oh, no you don't! Ooowww!!"
[OTH],Enough of this waste of time! Haman! The Great Summoning is done! Upon these words let your spirit come! Einich! Hos!
[OTH],It is lost.
[OTH],Zayak. Kareem!
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Hey, give that back!"
[OTH],It's the Squirts.
[OTH],"Go, Ike!"
[OTH],"Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys are up there."
[OTH],They'll never reach.
[OTH],"Squirts, fall in. Chinese formation."
[OTH],Give me that book!
[OTH],(Ow!)
[OTH],Haman will deal with you!
[OTH],(Ow!)
[OTH],"Oh, no. It's too late!"
[OTH],Ramek shtud!
[OTH],What is that?
[OTH],It is Haman.
[OTH],Yes! Yes!
[OTH],Free! Free to punish those that imprisoned me!
[OTH],"Haman! It's me, Garth! I freed you!"
[OTH],Look!
[OTH],"(It's okay, I'll use my head!)"
[OTH],Kenny! Noooooo!
[OTH],(Heeeeeyah! Ugh--!)
[OTH],Moses! Nooo!
[OTH],"Nooo! Eheh. Nooo! Moses. Uh I, I apologize for any inconvenience, eheh. Uh yuh you see, I was just uh--"
[OTH],Die!
[OTH],No! Aaagghhh! Ooww..!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Kenny!
[OTH],That blow to his head must have killed him.
[OTH],He saved us. He saved all the Jews.
[OTH],"You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass."
[OTH],"We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny."
[OTH],Every year we shall gather here in this special place and bring Kenny tidings of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures.
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],And those little shaker things where... you put beans inside of paper plates that are glued together.
[OTH],Paper-plate bean shakers.
[OTH],And let us put patterns of glue on the outside of those paper plates so we can then pour glitter on them so they can look nice and sparkly.
[OTH],"You heard him, Scouts! Let's get to work!"
[OTH],"We're here live at the KOZY 102.1 Halloween Haunt at the South Park docks! Come on down! We've got a haunted house and everyone is decorating for tomorrow night, HALLOWEEN, when the band KoRn, that's right, KoRn, is going to play live! And don't forget to wear a costume tomorrow, because there's a big first prize! Why, here's some kids enjoying the Halloween Haunt now! Say boys, what do you think of KOZY-FM's Halloween Haunt so far?"
[OTH],"This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt."
[OTH],"Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids."
Cartman,Hey you guys! You know what time of year it is?
[OTH],"Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween."
Cartman,"That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—"
[OTH],Christmas?
Cartman,—Christmastime is presents for me.
[OTH],"Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house."
[OTH],Awwww!
Cartman,"Eeyyy , Spooky Laboratory, you guys."
[OTH],"Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff."
Cartman,"Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory! Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells..."
[OTH],"Welcome to Spooky Laboratory. I'm your guide, Dr. Spookalot. Allow me to show around the lab."
Cartman,Cool!
[OTH],Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs.
Cartman,Ewww-hoohooo.
[OTH],And here you can feel the brains.
Cartman,"Oh-HO, grohoss."
[OTH],And here you can feel the warm innards of the body
Cartman,"Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!"
[OTH],"(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)"
[OTH],"Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck."
[OTH],BOO!
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],"Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens!"
[OTH],W-we weren't scared!
[OTH],"Oh no? Well, you should be! The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha!"
[OTH],The what?
[OTH],Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.
[OTH],Nuh-uh.
[OTH],Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands looking for victims tuh... cut up!
[OTH],(Hoh!)
[OTH],That's just an old legend.
[OTH],Rar!
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],"Ha ha ha ha, gotcha again, heh ha ha! Just wait till tomorrow! We're gonna scare you kids to death! Ha ha ha haa!"
Cartman,"You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it."
[OTH],I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
[OTH],Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
[OTH],"Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks?"
[OTH],Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh!
[OTH],"Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?"
[OTH],"KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil!"
[OTH],"Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow."
[OTH],"Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary."
Cartman,"We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary."
[OTH],"That's not scary, fatass!"
[OTH],"Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts!"
[OTH],Darrrr!
[OTH],Are you sure we're goin' the right way?
[OTH],I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.
[OTH],"That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead!"
[OTH],Oops.
[OTH],When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving.
[OTH],Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T!
[OTH],I know! A t-ree!
[OTH],You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R.
[OTH],A road?
[OTH],That's it!
[OTH],Darrrr!
[OTH],"Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P."
[OTH],The letter P?
[OTH],What the heck starts with the letter P?
[OTH],Puh-pirate ghosts!
[OTH],Aaaaah!
Cartman,"Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see. I waant... thiis... aand... this... and... let's see, comes with so... ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that... and, let's see..."
[OTH],"Eric, your little friends are here."
Cartman,"Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?"
[OTH],"E-heric, it's only Halloween."
Cartman,That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
[OTH],"Come on, fatass, we have to go!"
Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat! Mom, don't laugh."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, hon,"
Cartman,I can't go with you guys right now.
[OTH],"Yes you can, porky."
Cartman,"Mom, seriously!"
[OTH],"Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, he's big-boned."
[OTH],"He must have a huge bone in his ass, then."
Cartman,"God-damnit, mom!"
Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!"
[OTH],"Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders."
Cartman,How?
[OTH],What's the scariest thing we could get?
Cartman,Spooky spider?
[OTH],No! A dead body.
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass, a dead body."
Cartman,"You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?"
[OTH],"We could never make one that looks real enough. To be really scary, it would have to be real."
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!"
Cartman,So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
[OTH],We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up- Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??"
[OTH],"Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?"
[OTH],Are you insane?!
Cartman,U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
[OTH],(Yeah!)
[OTH],Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
[OTH],"All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,"
[OTH],"Naww, let's dig up somebody else."
[OTH],"Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to."
Cartman,This is gonna be fun!
Cartman,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' tooOutside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you."
[OTH],"Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!"
[OTH],"This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma."
[OTH],"Well, let's dig 'er up!"
[OTH],Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
[OTH],Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
[OTH],I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
Cartman,"""Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!"" Ow."
[OTH],"You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!"
[OTH],"I don't really care, dude."
[OTH],"Yes you do! Now, dig!"
Cartman,"Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""You-hoo""..."
[OTH],"Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three! Whoa, dude."
[OTH],"Oh, my God. Hi, ...Grandma."
[OTH],"Hi, Kyle."
[OTH],Aaaah!
Cartman,"Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?"
[OTH],"Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!"
[OTH],"Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh."
Cartman,"Heh heh, I'm sweet."
[OTH],"Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!"
[OTH],"Okay, grab the sled."
Cartman,"Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city..."
[OTH],"Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders."
[OTH],How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
Cartman,"We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: ""Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"""
[OTH],"Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!"
[OTH],O-o-o-o-oh.
[OTH],Who was that?
[OTH],Cartman?!
Cartman,It wasn't me!
[OTH],Who-o-oa.
[OTH],"Dude, not cool. This is scary."
[OTH],Wa-a-a-ah!
[OTH],"Hey! Like, it's just some kids."
[OTH],"Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second."
[OTH],"Hay, you're that band KoRn."
[OTH],"Yeah. I'm Jonathan , and this is Munky , David , Fieldy , and Head . And over there is our pal, Nibblet. Hey, where'd Nibblet go?"
[OTH],"Uh-huh, Nibblet likes potato chips."
[OTH],Nibblet!
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],What are you guys doing out here?
[OTH],We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts.
[OTH],"Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders."
[OTH],Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
[OTH],Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
[OTH],"Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. It's right over there."
[OTH],O-kay!
[OTH],"Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow."
[OTH],I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!
[OTH],Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?
[OTH],"Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes."
[OTH],Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
[OTH],"Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!"
[OTH],Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
[OTH],(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
Cartman,"Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!"
[OTH],"(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?)"
[OTH],"Hold on, kids."
[OTH],Mrs. Broflovski?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?
[OTH],"Eehh, sure, come in. What is it?"
[OTH],Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.
[OTH],Defiled? How?
[OTH],"Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up."
[OTH],Dug her up? Why??
[OTH],Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.
[OTH],Yeahp.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak."
[OTH],"Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable."
[OTH],"Hoh, dear God!"
[OTH],Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it."
[OTH],O-o-o-o-oh!
[OTH],"Yes. And, now for the difficult part."
[OTH],Brace yourself.
[OTH],"It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like — an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-"
[OTH],"Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!"
[OTH],...Do?
[OTH],"Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen."
[OTH],"Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something."
[OTH],O-o-ogh!
[OTH],"Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition."
[OTH],Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?
Cartman,"A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!"
[OTH],"Sign heah, and heah, and heah."
Cartman,"I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present! ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner. Let's see here. That's good, I'll rewrap it later! Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia. Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got!"
[OTH],"It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes!"
[OTH],Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever.
Cartman,Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
[OTH],"Where's your costume, fatass?"
Cartman,"Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like ""Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!"""
[OTH],"Hey, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)"
Cartman,"U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!"
[OTH],Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma! This is gonna be sweet
Cartman,"Uuh, problem, guys."
[OTH],What's the problem?
Cartman,Nno Grandma.
[OTH],No Grandma??
Cartman,Nno Grandma.
[OTH],She's not here!
[OTH],She has to be here!
[OTH],"Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!"
[OTH],"Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen?"
[OTH],"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like."
[OTH],Ee-oooh!
[OTH],"Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like."
[OTH],Awwwgh!
[OTH],"Excuse me, how is this helping?"
[OTH],"That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt."
[OTH],"Noo! Don't go to the docks! Aarrrgh! Argh, I'm Captain Bly! You land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks! Or else, there'll be hell to pay! Fire the cannon! Har harharharhar!"
[OTH],Arrrgh!
[OTH],We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks!
[OTH],"I warned you! I told you this would happen! When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get!"
[OTH],"Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts."
[OTH],"Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled."
[OTH],Cancelled?
[OTH],"You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you."
[OTH],"Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!"
[OTH],"Oh, hey! The kids from last night."
[OTH],Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll?
[OTH],"Hey, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Aw, man!)"
[OTH],"Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum."
[OTH],Somebody took my dead grandma.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away."
[OTH],Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo.
[OTH],"Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry."
[OTH],"Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts."
[OTH],"They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"""Pirate ghost"" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate."
[OTH],"No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates."
[OTH],"You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact."
[OTH],But that makes them pirate ghosts.
[OTH],No. It makes them ghost pirates.
[OTH],Pirate ghosts!
[OTH],Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.
[OTH],Pirate ghosts.
[OTH],"Then, you'll help us?"
[OTH],"Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery."
[OTH],Al-right!
[OTH],Is everybody okay?
[OTH],People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
[OTH],"I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play."
[OTH],He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.
[OTH],"Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Lynch mob!
[OTH],Down with KoRn!
[OTH],So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
[OTH],"Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues."
[OTH],How should we split up?
[OTH],"I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way, and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way."
[OTH],O-kay!
[OTH],Wow! That was easy.
[OTH],Here's their van! Here's their van!
[OTH],Let's flip it over!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top."
[OTH],Devil worshipers!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!"
[OTH],This place gives me the creeps.
[OTH],"Say, this looks like a clue. ""Pirate Lore of South Park."" Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates?"
[OTH],Whoa. What was that?
[OTH],"The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody!"
[OTH],"Oh, no! I lost my glasses."
[OTH],What does this dead grandma look like?
Cartman,"Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff."
[OTH],"Hey, I got an idea. We should set a groovy trap."
[OTH],Good idea.
Cartman,How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
[OTH],"We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll."
Cartman,"Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!"
[OTH],"Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio."
[OTH],"My glasses gotta be around here somewhere. Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you. I lost my glasses."
[OTH],Raaarrrgh!
[OTH],"Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?"
[OTH],Raarraarrgh!
[OTH],"Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one!"
[OTH],"Fieldy, what are you doing?!"
[OTH],"Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you're over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you're actually a..."
[OTH],Puh-puuhh pirate ghost!
[OTH],Raaarrrgh!
[OTH],"Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas. When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them."
Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],Hey! Somebody's coming.
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],We've got to hide!
[OTH],"Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us. Mr. Banderas!"
[OTH],"Jonathan, no!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Hold on, guys!"
[OTH],"Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town!"
[OTH],Aarrrrgh.
[OTH],Aaaaaah!
[OTH],KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
[OTH],Aaaaaah!
[OTH],"Alright, gang. Looks like we're gonna have to use our special KoRn powers. KoRn powers, vitalize!"
[OTH],Munky!
[OTH],David!
[OTH],Fieldy!
[OTH],Head!
[OTH],Jonathan!
[OTH],Form of... CORN!
[OTH],"Alright! Great job, gang!"
Cartman,That didn't help at all.
[OTH],We know. It's just cool to do.
[OTH],Aarrrrgh!
[OTH],Nibblet!
[OTH],Nibblet!
[OTH],What the hell is that thing??
[OTH],"You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them!"
[OTH],"Yeah. And now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are! Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts."
[OTH],"Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!"
[OTH],"Hehey, look what Nibblet sees."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],What the...?
[OTH],Father Maxi?
[OTH],"Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band!"
[OTH],Oh?
[OTH],No! Arrest him!
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],I think I've got this groovy mystery solved!
[OTH],"Well, I must say I still don't get this at all."
[OTH],"It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks."
[OTH],Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts.
[OTH],Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese. Aaaaraargh!
[OTH],"And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels."
[OTH],"Father, why did you go to all this trouble?"
[OTH],"Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!"
[OTH],Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
[OTH],Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Okay buddy, you can explain downtown!"
[OTH],"Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!"
[OTH],Yeah! Where's Grandma?
[OTH],Eeewww!
[OTH],There she is!
[OTH],Oooh!
[OTH],Ho-hoh.
[OTH],"Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!"
[OTH],Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
[OTH],"Well, sure. Why the heck not?"
[OTH],All right!
[OTH],Raarrrr!
[OTH],"Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back!"
[OTH],Nibblet!
[OTH],Uh oh!
[OTH],"Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:And a-one, and-a-two, and a"
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Sweet!
Cartman,"Antonio, no! You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here!"
[OTH],"And the winner of the costume contest is Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! Come on up, Wendy."
[OTH],(Awww.)
[OTH],(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!)
[OTH],"We're here live at the KOZY 102.1 Halloween Haunt at the South Park docks! Come on down! We've got a haunted house and everyone is decorating for tomorrow night, HALLOWEEN, when the band KoRn, that's right, KoRn, is going to play live! And don't forget to wear a costume tomorrow, because there's a big first prize! Why, here's some kids enjoying the Halloween Haunt now! Say boys, what do you think of KOZY-FM's Halloween Haunt so far?"
[OTH],"This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt."
[OTH],"Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids."
Cartman,Hey you guys! You know what time of year it is?
[OTH],"Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween."
Cartman,"That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—"
[OTH],Christmas?
Cartman,—Christmastime is presents for me.
[OTH],"Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house."
[OTH],Awwww!
Cartman,"Eeyyy , Spooky Laboratory, you guys."
[OTH],"Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff."
Cartman,"Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory! Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells..."
[OTH],"Welcome to Spooky Laboratory. I'm your guide, Dr. Spookalot. Allow me to show around the lab."
Cartman,Cool!
[OTH],Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs.
Cartman,Ewww-hoohooo.
[OTH],And here you can feel the brains.
Cartman,"Oh-HO, grohoss."
[OTH],And here you can feel the warm innards of the body
Cartman,"Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!"
[OTH],"(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)"
[OTH],"Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck."
[OTH],BOO!
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],"Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens!"
[OTH],W-we weren't scared!
[OTH],"Oh no? Well, you should be! The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha!"
[OTH],The what?
[OTH],Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.
[OTH],Nuh-uh.
[OTH],Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands looking for victims tuh... cut up!
[OTH],(Hoh!)
[OTH],That's just an old legend.
[OTH],Rar!
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],"Ha ha ha ha, gotcha again, heh ha ha! Just wait till tomorrow! We're gonna scare you kids to death! Ha ha ha haa!"
Cartman,"You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it."
[OTH],I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
[OTH],Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
[OTH],"Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks?"
[OTH],Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh!
[OTH],"Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?"
[OTH],"KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil!"
[OTH],"Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow."
[OTH],"Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary."
Cartman,"We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary."
[OTH],"That's not scary, fatass!"
[OTH],"Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts!"
[OTH],Darrrr!
[OTH],Are you sure we're goin' the right way?
[OTH],I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.
[OTH],"That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead!"
[OTH],Oops.
[OTH],When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving.
[OTH],Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T!
[OTH],I know! A t-ree!
[OTH],You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R.
[OTH],A road?
[OTH],That's it!
[OTH],Darrrr!
[OTH],"Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P."
[OTH],The letter P?
[OTH],What the heck starts with the letter P?
[OTH],Puh-pirate ghosts!
[OTH],Aaaaah!
Cartman,"Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see. I waant... thiis... aand... this... and... let's see, comes with so... ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that... and, let's see..."
[OTH],"Eric, your little friends are here."
Cartman,"Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?"
[OTH],"E-heric, it's only Halloween."
Cartman,That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
[OTH],"Come on, fatass, we have to go!"
Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat! Mom, don't laugh."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, hon,"
Cartman,I can't go with you guys right now.
[OTH],"Yes you can, porky."
Cartman,"Mom, seriously!"
[OTH],"Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, he's big-boned."
[OTH],"He must have a huge bone in his ass, then."
Cartman,"God-damnit, mom!"
Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!"
[OTH],"Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders."
Cartman,How?
[OTH],What's the scariest thing we could get?
Cartman,Spooky spider?
[OTH],No! A dead body.
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass, a dead body."
Cartman,"You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?"
[OTH],"We could never make one that looks real enough. To be really scary, it would have to be real."
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!"
Cartman,So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
[OTH],We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up- Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??"
[OTH],"Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?"
[OTH],Are you insane?!
Cartman,U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
[OTH],(Yeah!)
[OTH],Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
[OTH],"All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,"
[OTH],"Naww, let's dig up somebody else."
[OTH],"Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to."
Cartman,This is gonna be fun!
Cartman,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' tooOutside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you."
[OTH],"Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!"
[OTH],"This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma."
[OTH],"Well, let's dig 'er up!"
[OTH],Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
[OTH],Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
[OTH],I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
Cartman,"""Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!"" Ow."
[OTH],"You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!"
[OTH],"I don't really care, dude."
[OTH],"Yes you do! Now, dig!"
Cartman,"Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""You-hoo""..."
[OTH],"Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three! Whoa, dude."
[OTH],"Oh, my God. Hi, ...Grandma."
[OTH],"Hi, Kyle."
[OTH],Aaaah!
Cartman,"Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?"
[OTH],"Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!"
[OTH],"Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh."
Cartman,"Heh heh, I'm sweet."
[OTH],"Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!"
[OTH],"Okay, grab the sled."
Cartman,"Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city..."
[OTH],"Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders."
[OTH],How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
Cartman,"We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: ""Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"""
[OTH],"Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!"
[OTH],O-o-o-o-oh.
[OTH],Who was that?
[OTH],Cartman?!
Cartman,It wasn't me!
[OTH],Who-o-oa.
[OTH],"Dude, not cool. This is scary."
[OTH],Wa-a-a-ah!
[OTH],"Hey! Like, it's just some kids."
[OTH],"Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second."
[OTH],"Hay, you're that band KoRn."
[OTH],"Yeah. I'm Jonathan , and this is Munky , David , Fieldy , and Head . And over there is our pal, Nibblet. Hey, where'd Nibblet go?"
[OTH],"Uh-huh, Nibblet likes potato chips."
[OTH],Nibblet!
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],What are you guys doing out here?
[OTH],We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts.
[OTH],"Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders."
[OTH],Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
[OTH],Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
[OTH],"Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. It's right over there."
[OTH],O-kay!
[OTH],"Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow."
[OTH],I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!
[OTH],Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?
[OTH],"Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes."
[OTH],Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
[OTH],"Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!"
[OTH],Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
[OTH],(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
Cartman,"Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!"
[OTH],"(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?)"
[OTH],"Hold on, kids."
[OTH],Mrs. Broflovski?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?
[OTH],"Eehh, sure, come in. What is it?"
[OTH],Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.
[OTH],Defiled? How?
[OTH],"Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up."
[OTH],Dug her up? Why??
[OTH],Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.
[OTH],Yeahp.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak."
[OTH],"Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable."
[OTH],"Hoh, dear God!"
[OTH],Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it."
[OTH],O-o-o-o-oh!
[OTH],"Yes. And, now for the difficult part."
[OTH],Brace yourself.
[OTH],"It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like — an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-"
[OTH],"Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!"
[OTH],...Do?
[OTH],"Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen."
[OTH],"Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something."
[OTH],O-o-ogh!
[OTH],"Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition."
[OTH],Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?
Cartman,"A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!"
[OTH],"Sign heah, and heah, and heah."
Cartman,"I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present! ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner. Let's see here. That's good, I'll rewrap it later! Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia. Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got!"
[OTH],"It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes!"
[OTH],Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever.
Cartman,Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
[OTH],"Where's your costume, fatass?"
Cartman,"Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like ""Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!"""
[OTH],"Hey, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)"
Cartman,"U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!"
[OTH],Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma! This is gonna be sweet
Cartman,"Uuh, problem, guys."
[OTH],What's the problem?
Cartman,Nno Grandma.
[OTH],No Grandma??
Cartman,Nno Grandma.
[OTH],She's not here!
[OTH],She has to be here!
[OTH],"Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!"
[OTH],"Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen?"
[OTH],"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like."
[OTH],Ee-oooh!
[OTH],"Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like."
[OTH],Awwwgh!
[OTH],"Excuse me, how is this helping?"
[OTH],"That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt."
[OTH],"Noo! Don't go to the docks! Aarrrgh! Argh, I'm Captain Bly! You land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks! Or else, there'll be hell to pay! Fire the cannon! Har harharharhar!"
[OTH],Arrrgh!
[OTH],We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks!
[OTH],"I warned you! I told you this would happen! When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get!"
[OTH],"Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts."
[OTH],"Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled."
[OTH],Cancelled?
[OTH],"You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you."
[OTH],"Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!"
[OTH],"Oh, hey! The kids from last night."
[OTH],Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll?
[OTH],"Hey, Kenny."
[OTH],"(Aw, man!)"
[OTH],"Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum."
[OTH],Somebody took my dead grandma.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away."
[OTH],Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo.
[OTH],"Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry."
[OTH],"Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts."
[OTH],"They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"""Pirate ghost"" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate."
[OTH],"No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates."
[OTH],"You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact."
[OTH],But that makes them pirate ghosts.
[OTH],No. It makes them ghost pirates.
[OTH],Pirate ghosts!
[OTH],Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.
[OTH],Pirate ghosts.
[OTH],"Then, you'll help us?"
[OTH],"Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery."
[OTH],Al-right!
[OTH],Is everybody okay?
[OTH],People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
[OTH],"I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play."
[OTH],He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.
[OTH],"Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Lynch mob!
[OTH],Down with KoRn!
[OTH],So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
[OTH],"Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues."
[OTH],How should we split up?
[OTH],"I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way, and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way."
[OTH],O-kay!
[OTH],Wow! That was easy.
[OTH],Here's their van! Here's their van!
[OTH],Let's flip it over!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top."
[OTH],Devil worshipers!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!"
[OTH],This place gives me the creeps.
[OTH],"Say, this looks like a clue. ""Pirate Lore of South Park."" Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates?"
[OTH],Whoa. What was that?
[OTH],"The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody!"
[OTH],"Oh, no! I lost my glasses."
[OTH],What does this dead grandma look like?
Cartman,"Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff."
[OTH],"Hey, I got an idea. We should set a groovy trap."
[OTH],Good idea.
Cartman,How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
[OTH],"We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll."
Cartman,"Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!"
[OTH],"Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio."
[OTH],"My glasses gotta be around here somewhere. Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you. I lost my glasses."
[OTH],Raaarrrgh!
[OTH],"Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?"
[OTH],Raarraarrgh!
[OTH],"Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one!"
[OTH],"Fieldy, what are you doing?!"
[OTH],"Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you're over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you're actually a..."
[OTH],Puh-puuhh pirate ghost!
[OTH],Raaarrrgh!
[OTH],"Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas. When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them."
Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],Hey! Somebody's coming.
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],We've got to hide!
[OTH],"Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us. Mr. Banderas!"
[OTH],"Jonathan, no!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Hold on, guys!"
[OTH],"Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town!"
[OTH],Aarrrrgh.
[OTH],Aaaaaah!
[OTH],KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
[OTH],Aaaaaah!
[OTH],"Alright, gang. Looks like we're gonna have to use our special KoRn powers. KoRn powers, vitalize!"
[OTH],Munky!
[OTH],David!
[OTH],Fieldy!
[OTH],Head!
[OTH],Jonathan!
[OTH],Form of... CORN!
[OTH],"Alright! Great job, gang!"
Cartman,That didn't help at all.
[OTH],We know. It's just cool to do.
[OTH],Aarrrrgh!
[OTH],Nibblet!
[OTH],Nibblet!
[OTH],What the hell is that thing??
[OTH],"You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them!"
[OTH],"Yeah. And now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are! Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts."
[OTH],"Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!"
[OTH],"Hehey, look what Nibblet sees."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],What the...?
[OTH],Father Maxi?
[OTH],"Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band!"
[OTH],Oh?
[OTH],No! Arrest him!
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],I think I've got this groovy mystery solved!
[OTH],"Well, I must say I still don't get this at all."
[OTH],"It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks."
[OTH],Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts.
[OTH],Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese. Aaaaraargh!
[OTH],"And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels."
[OTH],"Father, why did you go to all this trouble?"
[OTH],"Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!"
[OTH],Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
[OTH],Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Okay buddy, you can explain downtown!"
[OTH],"Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!"
[OTH],Yeah! Where's Grandma?
[OTH],Eeewww!
[OTH],There she is!
[OTH],Oooh!
[OTH],Ho-hoh.
[OTH],"Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!"
[OTH],Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
[OTH],"Well, sure. Why the heck not?"
[OTH],All right!
[OTH],Raarrrr!
[OTH],"Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back!"
[OTH],Nibblet!
[OTH],Uh oh!
[OTH],"Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:And a-one, and-a-two, and a"
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Sweet!
Cartman,"Antonio, no! You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here!"
[OTH],"And the winner of the costume contest is Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! Come on up, Wendy."
[OTH],(Awww.)
[OTH],(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!)
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty!"
[OTH],"Someday, I will collect all the Chinpokomon, then I will fight the Evil Power that will reveal itself once all the Chinpokomon are collectable, oh?"
[OTH],Meow?
Cartman,"No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?"
[OTH],Be sure to tune in tomorrow for another inexplicable episode of... Chinpokomon.
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],Hey kids! Do you love Chinpokomon?
Cartman,Yes.
[OTH],"Well, now you can buy your very own!"
[OTH],"I got to buy ChinpokomonI got to buy it, I got to buy it!"
[OTH],"Now you can collect them all. Furrycat, Donkeytron, Pengin, Shoe, Lambtor. Collect them all, and you can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master."
Cartman,Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
[OTH],All the Chinpokomon are in stores now.
[OTH],"Chinpokomon is soo-peh-rior rubbeh toy, Nuhmbah 1!"
[OTH],I got to buy it! Chinpo-ko-mon!
Cartman,Mom! Mom!
Cartman,"Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!"
[OTH],"Eric, calm down."
Cartman,Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
[OTH],"What is it, Eric?"
Cartman,"Mom-Mom! I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store!"
[OTH],"I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric."
Cartman,"...But Mom, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool."
[OTH],"Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?"
Cartman,"...But Mom, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!"
[OTH],Alright! let's go.
Cartman,Sweet.
Cartman,Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon.
[OTH],Wuh-I love Chinpokomon.
[OTH],Give it to me!
[OTH],Give it here!
[OTH],Give me that!
Cartman,"Oh, god damnit!"
[OTH],"Hey, fatass."
Cartman,"Hey, dickhole. I guess you saw the commercial, too."
[OTH],"Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe."
Cartman,"Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the cutest. God damnit, there's no more Pengins! Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it."
[OTH],(Nuh uh.)
Cartman,C'mon.
[OTH],(Nuh uh!)
Cartman,"C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--"
[OTH],(No!)
Cartman,C'mon.
[OTH],(No!)
Cartman,C'mon. Give me Pengin!
[OTH],(No! This is mine!)
Cartman,C'mon!
[OTH],"Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things."
[OTH],They're so strange. Where are they from?
[OTH],"Well, it's some new big thing from Japan. I tell you, those Japanese really know how to market to kids."
[OTH],"I've got to collect all Chinpokomon. I've got to collect them all so I can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master, oooh?"
[OTH],"Own-ah Chinpokomon, and-ah you vill-ah have-ah happy feelings-eh."
[OTH],I have to become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
[OTH],Must collect Chinpokomon.
Cartman,"Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin."
[OTH],(Fuck you!)
Cartman,"God damn it, you're supposed to trade, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!"
[OTH],Hey dudes. What are those?
[OTH],What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon?
[OTH],"No, but look. I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll."
Cartman,"Oh, please! Cyborg Bill is so yesterday."
[OTH],"Yeah, like ancient history."
[OTH],Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
[OTH],"No, dude!"
Cartman,"Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle."
[OTH],Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
Cartman,It's all Chinpokomon now.
[OTH],"Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective."
[OTH],What's the Primary Main Objective?
Cartman,You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
[OTH],The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
[OTH],"Well, what's the Evil Power?"
[OTH],Ogh..!
Cartman,"Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,Duhhh!
[OTH],"Yeah, get with the times, dude."
Cartman,Duhhh!
[OTH],Shit!
[OTH],"Yeah, I guess so."
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?"
[OTH],What's a Chinpokomon?
[OTH],I'm not sure.
[OTH],"Well, why do you need one?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll."
[OTH],"Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon."
[OTH],"Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something."
[OTH],Neah Kyle doh.
[OTH],"You see, son, fads come and go. And this ""Chin-po-ko-mon"" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, ""I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual."" Do you understand?"
[OTH],"Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass."
[OTH],Hm... Good point; here's $10.
[OTH],Thanks.
[OTH],"Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too."
[OTH],"Hey, Chih-paw-ko."
[OTH],"There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things."
[OTH],Neither do I.
[OTH],I guess I'll call it a night.
[OTH],Chinpoko! Buy me! Buy me! When will you become Royal Chinpoko Master? Hurry up and buy me. Down with America!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"I love you. Let's be best friends, and destroy the capitalistic American government."
[OTH],What the hell is goin' on here?
[OTH],Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
Cartman,"Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?"
[OTH],Huh? No.
Cartman,"Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist!"
[OTH],"Chinpokomon, what is Primary Objective?"
Cartman,To destroy the Evil Power!
[OTH],"I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power, oooh?"
Cartman,Oooh?
[OTH],Damnit!
[OTH],"I've got to buy them all, so first I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor."
[OTH],Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! Deddy?
[OTH],Go!
[OTH],"(Hey, you guys...)"
[OTH],I must buy them all! I must buy them all!
Cartman,We must buy them all!
[OTH],Gottai to bomb thah hahbah!
[OTH],"Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!"
Cartman,Cool! This game rules!
[OTH],"Hello-o? Ey, hello?"
[OTH],Werucome to Chinpokomon Toy Corporashon. Purease state a-name.
[OTH],Rr-Red Harris? I own a toy store in America?
[OTH],Purease state the puhpose-uh.
[OTH],"Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls, talkin' about bringin' down American government and all?"
[OTH],"I am President Hirohito. And-ah, this is Mr. Ose."
[OTH],Peased to meet you.
[OTH],We unduhstand you have big concern about our fine pro-duct.
[OTH],"Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about?"
[OTH],The American government lies to you! Join the fight for Japanese supremacy of the world! More to come.
[OTH],Well?
[OTH],Uuuh.
[OTH],"That is so sturange. I do not a-know how this could happen. But urest assured, I will make sure it does not happong again!"
[OTH],"Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--"
[OTH],You are American?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Ogh! You must have very big pee-anis!
[OTH],Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!
[OTH],Nothing. We are very simple people. With very small penis. Mr. Ose penis is ...especially small.
[OTH],"Uh, smuh, so small."
[OTH],We cannot achieve much with so small penis. But you! Americans. Wow! Penis so big! Soo big penis!
[OTH],"Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size."
[OTH],"Minna-san, kite kite! This-a man has veh-ry big penis!"
[OTH],Take takeru o da ne?
[OTH],Hai.
[OTH],"Uh, hoh, what an-whoa immense penis-uh!"
[OTH],"Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now."
[OTH],"Good-bye. Thank you for stopping by, with your gargantuan penis. Dame, dame da. Naze kono chippu o soto wo detanda?"
[OTH],"Wa, wakarimasen, shachou-san. Mondai desu ne."
[OTH],Seki ni shou yoube!
[OTH],"Hai. Hai, shachou-san."
Cartman,I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
[OTH],"Amerika no kodomo minna ga Chinpokomon mo motte ima na. ""Phase two"" kaishi suru toki da. IKIMASHOO! The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!"
[OTH],What are you doing?
[OTH],I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values."
[OTH],"Hey, you must be Roostor! I haven't bought one of you yet, but I'll bet you can transform into Roostallion if you found Diamond Skill 7!"
[OTH],Roo-oo-oostor!
[OTH],"Hey, I'm gonna take your Roostor and put it in this bag, where it will flourish or expire, depending on fate!"
[OTH],Hey! Is that a good idea?
[OTH],Roostors aren't like Chuchunezumis. They haven't the heart for such endeavors.
[OTH],Oooh?
[OTH],...Are those good moral values?
[OTH],I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
[OTH],Lambtron! You are losing the battle of your life!
[OTH],But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?
[OTH],"I am sad now, because Lambtron must be very lonely because there are so few Lambtrons in the world. Will he ever find a companion?"
[OTH],This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
[OTH],"I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all."
[OTH],"Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!"
[OTH],"Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent."
[OTH],"No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation."
[OTH],"My God, you're right."
Cartman,"Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and..."
[OTH],"How's it goin', fat ass?"
Cartman,I haven't made any money yet.
[OTH],What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
Cartman,Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
[OTH],We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure.
[OTH],I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller!
Cartman,"Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!"
[OTH],Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
[OTH],Camp?
Cartman,The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
[OTH],You didn't know that?
[OTH],"No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight?"
[OTH],"Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""?"
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?"
Cartman,"Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore."
[OTH],"What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?"
Cartman,"Like, eight days ago."
[OTH],God damnit!
[OTH],"Hey, kids! Only one more day till the Chinpokomon camp! Come early and enjoy all the Chinpoko fun!"
[OTH],Chinpokomon Camp!I've got to buy a ticket!I've got to buy one! A ticket!I've got to buy buy buy!
[OTH],It'sa Satuhday anda Sunday. You can'ta wait to go!
[OTH],Chinpokomon!
[OTH],"We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel."
[OTH],"Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad."
[OTH],"Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did."
[OTH],"Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys."
[OTH],"Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them."
[OTH],"You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it."
[OTH],"Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?"
Cartman,Get outta the way! Move it!
[OTH],Can you see anything?
[OTH],Yay!!!
[OTH],"It's starting, it's starting!"
[OTH],I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon!
[OTH],Attention! Attention! This isa Chinpokomon Camp!

Cartman,Ohhh.
[OTH],United Statesuh government is the Evil Power! It hasa taken Japanese Americans! It hasa broken Japanese spirit! And what do Chinpoko Masters do to Evil Power?!
[OTH],Destroy it!
[OTH],Destroy it?
[OTH],"That isa correct! Now, it isa great honor to present... your Chinpoko Leaduh! Emperor Hirohito!"
[OTH],"Welcome to campu. Whoever passes it knows and honors that the greatness of Japan is in its history, and it is based on that history that we shall again rise to the dominant world powuh!"
Cartman,Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
[OTH],It is again time for the Rising Sun to sit tall in the sight! One Japan! One society!
[OTH],We will begin witha language anda exercise skills. Hajimete!!
[OTH],"Ichi, ni, san, shi!"
[OTH],"Ichi, ni, san, shi! Ichi, ni, san, shi!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, I want it quiet! Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is six times three?"
[OTH],Juuhachi desu ka?
[OTH],Juuhachi da nee!
[OTH],"No, goddammit, it's eighteen!!"
[OTH],"Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san."
[OTH],"For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!"
Cartman,"Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana."
[OTH],What did he say?!
[OTH],"He said, ""Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."""
[OTH],Soo desu nee!
[OTH],"Damnit, this is not Japan!!"
Cartman,"Minna-san! Kite kite, churi..."
[OTH],Dare ga pu shita no.
[OTH],Aggghhh!
[OTH],"People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying..."
[OTH],"I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp."
[OTH],My son hasn't made any sense in days.
[OTH],"I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow!"
[OTH],"Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen?"
[OTH],We at the Japan Toy Company are vetty cohncerned about-a your cohncerns. That is why we make Chinpokomon camp.
[OTH],"Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!"
[OTH],There is nothing to worry about. We at Japan Toy Company are in awe of your large penis.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"You see, Japanese penis so small."
[OTH],So-eh small.
[OTH],You Americans have such humungous burbous penis.
[OTH],"Well, uh-I guess that's true."
[OTH],"Oh, suh-n nice-a big penis American."
[OTH],"What can we possubruh do with such small penis? We cannot take over your city, filled witha men awith such mastodonic penis."
[OTH],"Huwell, uh he's got a point there."
[OTH],"Well, I guess that settles that."
[OTH],"We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen."
[OTH],"Oh, no. Thank you. Another chance to be in same room with big American penis."
[OTH],"Uh-uh, my penis so small."
[OTH],Nice guys.
[OTH],"Jikan ga nai. Sugu ni bara de shimaou. Shikashi, itsu baru shinkuro isoga reba."
[OTH],"So, what are we going to do about our children? Ahhh, hello-o?"
[OTH],"O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution."
[OTH],You have?
[OTH],Children are fickle. All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
[OTH],Of course! That's a great idea!
[OTH],But what toy?
[OTH],"Alright, boys, we're going to show you a couple of commercials, and you tell us which toy interests you the most. Now, watch carefully."
[OTH],"Hey, kids. Do you like Chinpokomon?"

[OTH],Misenasai!

[OTH],Beikoku!
[OTH],"Oh God, is there nothing we can do?"
[OTH],"Wait a minute... Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon!"
[OTH],How?
[OTH],Come on! We don't have much time!
[OTH],"And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States."
[OTH],"My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you."
[OTH],Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arrive you will drop many bombs!
[OTH],"Hai, shachou-san."
[OTH],Nan da kore?
[OTH],Chinpoko ga dai-suki yo!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!"
[OTH],You like it?
[OTH],You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
[OTH],"Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron."
Cartman,"Uh... no, that's okay, Mom."
[OTH],Whar are they doing?!
[OTH],It's a trick!
[OTH],"Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker. Isn't that cool?"
[OTH],"No. Screw this, dude."
Cartman,"Where are you going, Stan?"
[OTH],"Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something."
Cartman,"Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes."
[OTH],Yeah. Me too! Me too.
[OTH],Nooo!!
[OTH],"Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves."
[OTH],"That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool. We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down!"
[OTH],"Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?"
[OTH],"You bet, Stanley!"
[OTH],Owatta Beikoku!
[OTH],"Kyle, it's over!"
[OTH],But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
[OTH],"Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"Yeah, dude, that's way over."
[OTH],"Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!"
[OTH],"No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused."
[OTH],So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
[OTH],...Ye-eah.
[OTH],"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya."
[OTH],"Oh... Wait. Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes."
[OTH],"Aw, screw it; I'm too confused."
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over."
Cartman,"Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!"
Cartman,"Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!"
[OTH],"Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?"
[OTH],"Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while."
Cartman,"Me, too. I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause--"
[OTH],What the..?
Cartman,"Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss!"
[OTH],(over the Braniff Airlines logo) Bye bye buh-buh-buh-buh-buh chicken!
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!"
[OTH],Meow.
Cartman,"No, Kitty!"
[OTH],"Someday, I will collect all the Chinpokomon, then I will fight the Evil Power that will reveal itself once all the Chinpokomon are collectable, oh?"
[OTH],Meow?
Cartman,"No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?"
[OTH],Be sure to tune in tomorrow for another inexplicable episode of... Chinpokomon.
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],Hey kids! Do you love Chinpokomon?
Cartman,Yes.
[OTH],"Well, now you can buy your very own!"
[OTH],"I got to buy ChinpokomonI got to buy it, I got to buy it!"
[OTH],"Now you can collect them all. Furrycat, Donkeytron, Pengin, Shoe, Lambtor. Collect them all, and you can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master."
Cartman,Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
[OTH],All the Chinpokomon are in stores now.
[OTH],"Chinpokomon is soo-peh-rior rubbeh toy, Nuhmbah 1!"
[OTH],I got to buy it! Chinpo-ko-mon!
Cartman,Mom! Mom!
Cartman,"Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!"
[OTH],"Eric, calm down."
Cartman,Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
[OTH],"What is it, Eric?"
Cartman,"Mom-Mom! I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store!"
[OTH],"I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric."
Cartman,"...But Mom, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool."
[OTH],"Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?"
Cartman,"...But Mom, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!"
[OTH],Alright! let's go.
Cartman,Sweet.
Cartman,Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon.
[OTH],Wuh-I love Chinpokomon.
[OTH],Give it to me!
[OTH],Give it here!
[OTH],Give me that!
Cartman,"Oh, god damnit!"
[OTH],"Hey, fatass."
Cartman,"Hey, dickhole. I guess you saw the commercial, too."
[OTH],"Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe."
Cartman,"Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the cutest. God damnit, there's no more Pengins! Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it."
[OTH],(Nuh uh.)
Cartman,C'mon.
[OTH],(Nuh uh!)
Cartman,"C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--"
[OTH],(No!)
Cartman,C'mon.
[OTH],(No!)
Cartman,C'mon. Give me Pengin!
[OTH],(No! This is mine!)
Cartman,C'mon!
[OTH],"Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things."
[OTH],They're so strange. Where are they from?
[OTH],"Well, it's some new big thing from Japan. I tell you, those Japanese really know how to market to kids."
[OTH],"I've got to collect all Chinpokomon. I've got to collect them all so I can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master, oooh?"
[OTH],"Own-ah Chinpokomon, and-ah you vill-ah have-ah happy feelings-eh."
[OTH],I have to become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
[OTH],Must collect Chinpokomon.
Cartman,"Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin."
[OTH],(Fuck you!)
Cartman,"God damn it, you're supposed to trade, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!"
[OTH],Hey dudes. What are those?
[OTH],What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon?
[OTH],"No, but look. I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll."
Cartman,"Oh, please! Cyborg Bill is so yesterday."
[OTH],"Yeah, like ancient history."
[OTH],Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
[OTH],"No, dude!"
Cartman,"Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle."
[OTH],Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
Cartman,It's all Chinpokomon now.
[OTH],"Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective."
[OTH],What's the Primary Main Objective?
Cartman,You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
[OTH],The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
[OTH],"Well, what's the Evil Power?"
[OTH],Ogh..!
Cartman,"Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,Duhhh!
[OTH],"Yeah, get with the times, dude."
Cartman,Duhhh!
[OTH],Shit!
[OTH],"Yeah, I guess so."
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?"
[OTH],What's a Chinpokomon?
[OTH],I'm not sure.
[OTH],"Well, why do you need one?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll."
[OTH],"Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon."
[OTH],"Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something."
[OTH],Neah Kyle doh.
[OTH],"You see, son, fads come and go. And this ""Chin-po-ko-mon"" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, ""I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual."" Do you understand?"
[OTH],"Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass."
[OTH],Hm... Good point; here's $10.
[OTH],Thanks.
[OTH],"Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too."
[OTH],"Hey, Chih-paw-ko."
[OTH],"There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things."
[OTH],Neither do I.
[OTH],I guess I'll call it a night.
[OTH],Chinpoko! Buy me! Buy me! When will you become Royal Chinpoko Master? Hurry up and buy me. Down with America!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"I love you. Let's be best friends, and destroy the capitalistic American government."
[OTH],What the hell is goin' on here?
[OTH],Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
Cartman,"Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?"
[OTH],Huh? No.
Cartman,"Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist!"
[OTH],"Chinpokomon, what is Primary Objective?"
Cartman,To destroy the Evil Power!
[OTH],"I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power, oooh?"
Cartman,Oooh?
[OTH],Damnit!
[OTH],"I've got to buy them all, so first I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor."
[OTH],Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! Deddy?
[OTH],Go!
[OTH],"(Hey, you guys...)"
[OTH],I must buy them all! I must buy them all!
Cartman,We must buy them all!

[OTH],Rr-Red Harris? I own a toy store in America?
[OTH],Purease state the puhpose-uh.
[OTH],"Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls, talkin' about bringin' down American government and all?"
[OTH],"I am President Hirohito. And-ah, this is Mr. Ose."
[OTH],Peased to meet you.
[OTH],We unduhstand you have big concern about our fine pro-duct.
[OTH],"Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about?"
[OTH],The American government lies to you! Join the fight for Japanese supremacy of the world! More to come.
[OTH],Well?
[OTH],Uuuh.
[OTH],"That is so sturange. I do not a-know how this could happen. But urest assured, I will make sure it does not happong again!"
[OTH],"Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--"
[OTH],You are American?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Ogh! You must have very big pee-anis!
[OTH],Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!
[OTH],Nothing. We are very simple people. With very small penis. Mr. Ose penis is ...especially small.
[OTH],"Uh, smuh, so small."
[OTH],We cannot achieve much with so small penis. But you! Americans. Wow! Penis so big! Soo big penis!
[OTH],"Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size."
[OTH],"Minna-san, kite kite! This-a man has veh-ry big penis!"
[OTH],Take takeru o da ne?
[OTH],Hai.
[OTH],"Uh, hoh, what an-whoa immense penis-uh!"
[OTH],"Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now."
[OTH],"Good-bye. Thank you for stopping by, with your gargantuan penis. Dame, dame da. Naze kono chippu o soto wo detanda?"
[OTH],"Wa, wakarimasen, shachou-san. Mondai desu ne."
[OTH],Seki ni shou yoube!
[OTH],"Hai. Hai, shachou-san."
Cartman,I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
[OTH],"Amerika no kodomo minna ga Chinpokomon mo motte ima na. ""Phase two"" kaishi suru toki da. IKIMASHOO! The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!"
[OTH],What are you doing?
[OTH],I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values."
[OTH],"Hey, you must be Roostor! I haven't bought one of you yet, but I'll bet you can transform into Roostallion if you found Diamond Skill 7!"
[OTH],Roo-oo-oostor!
[OTH],"Hey, I'm gonna take your Roostor and put it in this bag, where it will flourish or expire, depending on fate!"
[OTH],Hey! Is that a good idea?
[OTH],Roostors aren't like Chuchunezumis. They haven't the heart for such endeavors.
[OTH],Oooh?
[OTH],...Are those good moral values?
[OTH],I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
[OTH],Lambtron! You are losing the battle of your life!
[OTH],But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?
[OTH],"I am sad now, because Lambtron must be very lonely because there are so few Lambtrons in the world. Will he ever find a companion?"
[OTH],This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
[OTH],"I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all."
[OTH],"Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!"
[OTH],"Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent."
[OTH],"No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation."
[OTH],"My God, you're right."
Cartman,"Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and..."
[OTH],"How's it goin', fat ass?"
Cartman,I haven't made any money yet.
[OTH],What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
Cartman,Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
[OTH],We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure.
[OTH],I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller!
Cartman,"Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!"
[OTH],Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
[OTH],Camp?
Cartman,The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
[OTH],You didn't know that?
[OTH],"No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight?"
[OTH],"Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""?"
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?"
Cartman,"Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!"
[OTH],"Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore."
[OTH],"What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?"
Cartman,"Like, eight days ago."
[OTH],God damnit!
[OTH],"Hey, kids! Only one more day till the Chinpokomon camp! Come early and enjoy all the Chinpoko fun!"
[OTH],Chinpokomon Camp!I've got to buy a ticket!I've got to buy one! A ticket!I've got to buy buy buy!
[OTH],It'sa Satuhday anda Sunday. You can'ta wait to go!
[OTH],Chinpokomon!
[OTH],"We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel."
[OTH],"Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad."
[OTH],"Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did."
[OTH],"Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys."
[OTH],"Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them."
[OTH],"You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it."
[OTH],"Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?"
Cartman,Get outta the way! Move it!
[OTH],Can you see anything?
[OTH],Yay!!!
[OTH],"It's starting, it's starting!"
[OTH],I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon!

[OTH],Destroy it!
[OTH],Destroy it?
[OTH],"That isa correct! Now, it isa great honor to present... your Chinpoko Leaduh! Emperor Hirohito!"
[OTH],"Welcome to campu. Whoever passes it knows and honors that the greatness of Japan is in its history, and it is based on that history that we shall again rise to the dominant world powuh!"
Cartman,Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
[OTH],It is again time for the Rising Sun to sit tall in the sight! One Japan! One society!
[OTH],We will begin witha language anda exercise skills. Hajimete!!
[OTH],"Ichi, ni, san, shi!"

Cartman,"Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana."
[OTH],What did he say?!
[OTH],"He said, ""Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."""
[OTH],Soo desu nee!

Cartman,"Minna-san! Kite kite, churi..."
[OTH],Dare ga pu shita no.
[OTH],Aggghhh!
[OTH],"People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying..."
[OTH],"I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp."
[OTH],My son hasn't made any sense in days.
[OTH],"I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow!"
[OTH],"Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen?"
[OTH],We at the Japan Toy Company are vetty cohncerned about-a your cohncerns. That is why we make Chinpokomon camp.
[OTH],"Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!"
[OTH],There is nothing to worry about. We at Japan Toy Company are in awe of your large penis.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"You see, Japanese penis so small."
[OTH],So-eh small.
[OTH],You Americans have such humungous burbous penis.
[OTH],"Well, uh-I guess that's true."

[OTH],"Uh-uh, my penis so small."

[OTH],"So, what are we going to do about our children? Ahhh, hello-o?"
[OTH],"O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution."
[OTH],You have?
[OTH],Children are fickle. All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
[OTH],Of course! That's a great idea!
[OTH],But what toy?
[OTH],"Alright, boys, we're going to show you a couple of commercials, and you tell us which toy interests you the most. Now, watch carefully."

[OTH],"Hey, kids. Do you like Chinpokomon?"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Well then, you're gonna love... Alabama Man!"
[OTH],"Alabama ManHe's quick, he's strong, he's active."
[OTH],"You can take Alabama Man to the bowling alley, where he drinks heavily and chews tobacco."
[OTH],Wow! He can bowl.
[OTH],"He can bowl, he can drink, he can drink and bowlAlaba-ma Man!"
[OTH],"When his wife asks him where he's been, just use the action button, and Alabama Man busts her lip open."
[OTH],"Shut up, bitch!"
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],He beats up his wife and sleeps it offAlabama Man!
[OTH],I wanna be just like Alabama Man.
[OTH],Alabama Man comes with everything you see here. Wife sold separately.
[OTH],I thought I told you to shut up!
[OTH],Not all people from Alabama are wife-beaters.
Cartman,Gay.
[OTH],Totally gay.
[OTH],Liberace gay.
[OTH],"Oooh, dear. Well, let's keep trying. How about this?"
[OTH],Owatta!

[OTH],"Stan, please, come home!"
[OTH],Kore wa watashi no uchi desu.
[OTH],So desu née.
[OTH],Ooh? Do not worry. Everything isa okay.
[OTH],"No, it's not okay!"
[OTH],"Oh, but-a you have-a such large penis-uh."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Your penis, wooww-- O-oh..!"
[OTH],What he means is that all men in this town have very large penis.
[OTH],Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!
[OTH],Misenasai!
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],Owatta!
[OTH],Beikoku!
[OTH],Owatta!
[OTH],Beikoku!
[OTH],"Oh God, is there nothing we can do?"
[OTH],"Wait a minute... Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon!"
[OTH],How?
[OTH],Come on! We don't have much time!
[OTH],"And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States."
[OTH],"My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you."
[OTH],Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arrive you will drop many bombs!
[OTH],"Hai, shachou-san."
[OTH],Nan da kore?
[OTH],Chinpoko ga dai-suki yo!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!"
[OTH],You like it?
[OTH],You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
[OTH],"Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron."
Cartman,"Uh... no, that's okay, Mom."
[OTH],Whar are they doing?!
[OTH],It's a trick!
[OTH],"Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker. Isn't that cool?"
[OTH],"No. Screw this, dude."
Cartman,"Where are you going, Stan?"
[OTH],"Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something."
Cartman,"Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes."
[OTH],Yeah. Me too! Me too.
[OTH],Nooo!!
[OTH],"Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves."
[OTH],"That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool. We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down!"
[OTH],"Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?"
[OTH],"You bet, Stanley!"
[OTH],Owatta Beikoku!
[OTH],"Kyle, it's over!"
[OTH],But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
[OTH],"Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"Yeah, dude, that's way over."
[OTH],"Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!"
[OTH],"No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused."
[OTH],So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
[OTH],...Ye-eah.
[OTH],"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya."
[OTH],"Oh... Wait. Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes."
[OTH],"Aw, screw it; I'm too confused."
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over."
Cartman,"Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!"
Cartman,"Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!"
[OTH],"Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?"
[OTH],"Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while."
Cartman,"Me, too. I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause--"
[OTH],What the..?
Cartman,"Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss!"
[OTH],(over the Braniff Airlines logo) Bye bye buh-buh-buh-buh-buh chicken!
[OTH],"Eric, Mommy got you a present!"
Cartman,"A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!"
[OTH],"Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow."
Cartman,"Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do."
[OTH],"This year is gonna be different. Look! I got you ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics."""

[OTH],You bet money on my son to win?!
[OTH],"Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew."
Cartman,"You're going down, bitch!"
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you."
Cartman,"Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon!"
[OTH],"And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds!"
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
[OTH],"Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!"
[OTH],"What's a ""home-schooled kid""?"
[OTH],"I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before."
[OTH],"Go, Mark! Go, Rebecca!"
[OTH],"Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school. All right, Mark. Your word is ""conscientious."""
Cartman,What?! What the fuck that that mean?
[OTH],"""Conscientious."" May I have the definition, please?"

Cartman,"Uh- chair. C H A R E God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?! Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!"
[OTH],"All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school. Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral."
[OTH],"""Litoral."" Deh-finition?"

[OTH],Correct!
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Alright, Rebecca. Good job, honey."
[OTH],Now we have Kyle Broflovski. Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.

[OTH],Krocsyldiphithic.
[OTH],Definition?
[OTH],Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.
[OTH],"Uh, could you use it in a sentence?"
[OTH],"Certainly. ""Krocsyldiphithic"" is a hard word to spell."
[OTH],"""Krocsyldiphic."""
[OTH],"You can do it, kid! You can do it!"
[OTH],"""Krocsyldiphic."" C Damnit!"
[OTH],"You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks. Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!"
[OTH],"Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca. You are truly South Park's finest."
[OTH],"Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart."
Cartman,Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth.
[OTH],What's your name?
[OTH],Guh what's in a name?
[OTH],Wooww.
[OTH],It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
Cartman,"Oh, yes. We must do it again."
[OTH],We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
[OTH],No. I live right over there. I've lived there all my life.
Cartman,How come you don't go to school?
[OTH],Because I'm home-schooled.
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
Cartman,You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
[OTH],Right.
Cartman,"Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?"
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman?"
Cartman,"You shut up, butthole."
[OTH],"You shut up, gaywad!"
Cartman,"You shut up, ass-logger!"
[OTH],"Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?"
[OTH],"No, we're friends."
[OTH],"Strange, friends would call each other names and fight."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel."
[OTH],"Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos."
[OTH],Papa?
[OTH],"Yes, Mark?"
[OTH],Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous!"
[OTH],"But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá."
[OTH],"Mark, you have play time. You get to play in the afternoon."
[OTH],"I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like."
[OTH],"Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it."
[OTH],"Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days."
[OTH],"Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?"
[OTH],"Oh, heavens, no."
[OTH],"Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe!"
[OTH],"Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?"
[OTH],Yes she is.
[OTH],"...Uuh, can I talk to her?"
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I suppose so. Rebecca! This little boy wants to see you."
[OTH],Huhlo?
[OTH],"U-u-uh, hi."
[OTH],Hel-lo.
[OTH],"Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all."
[OTH],Who was that?
[OTH],A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.
[OTH],Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.
[OTH],"But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children."
[OTH],"Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark?"
[OTH],"Hey, guys. What's up?"
Cartman,"Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?"
[OTH],"Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America? Ehyes, Mark?"
Cartman,Ey! How come you never pick me?!
[OTH],"Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?"
[OTH],"The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade."
Cartman,"Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!"
[OTH],"Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards."
[OTH],"Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground."
[OTH],"Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from? Put your hand down, creampuff."
Cartman,That does it! I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
[OTH],"You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass."
Cartman,"I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled!"
[OTH],"Oh, please God, let it be forever."
[OTH],"Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me."""
[OTH],"But, if I say that, you'll hit me."
[OTH],"No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say ""Please, hit me,"" I won't hit you."
[OTH],"Please, hit me."
[OTH],All right.
[OTH],Ooowww!
[OTH],"Alright, we'll try this again, Pip."
[OTH],"I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time."
[OTH],"Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball."
[OTH],Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.
[OTH],"Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own."
[OTH],"Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench."
[OTH],You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
[OTH],"Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!"
[OTH],"Okay, let's get him..."
[OTH],Got it.
[OTH],"Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!"
[OTH],"Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!"
[OTH],"Oh, dear."
[OTH],"Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now."
[OTH],I'm sure he's alright.
[OTH],That must be him.
[OTH],Waaaaah!
[OTH],"Oh my God, son!"
[OTH],"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad."
[OTH],"Mark, what have they done to you?!"
[OTH],"Well, they duct-taped me to a bench."
[OTH],But why?
[OTH],"I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all."
[OTH],"Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!"
[OTH],"But I want to go back tomorrow, papá."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Please, just give me one more day."
[OTH],What do we do?
[OTH],"Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers."
[OTH],"Everywhere I go, I'm thinking of you, Rebecca. I don't know what to do, Rebecca. You're so nice, I'd like to get to know you better. So what do you say we get together?You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!Rebecca, you're really quite good-looking!You're a fox."
[OTH],"Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments. My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy."
[OTH],"Uh, look, Mr...."
[OTH],Cotswolds.
[OTH],"Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own."
[OTH],"Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better. And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop."
[OTH],"Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff."
[OTH],"Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?"
[OTH],"Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once."
[OTH],"I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!"
[OTH],"Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?"
[OTH],"No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers."
[OTH],You what??
[OTH],"See ya, Cotswolds. Thanks for stopping by."
[OTH],Yeah. See ya.
[OTH],...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
[OTH],Can I sit here with you?
[OTH],"Aw, man, if you have to."
[OTH],"Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early."
[OTH],Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
[OTH],"Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now."
[OTH],"(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)"
[OTH],Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff."
[OTH],"I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?"
[OTH],"Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me."
[OTH],"Ah, dude, you don't say that."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Get him!
[OTH],"Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school."
[OTH],Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
Cartman,Eeehhh.
[OTH],Welcome to Huntin' and Killin with Jimbo and Ned.
Cartman,"Eehh, shut up. Ooohhh, yeasss."
[OTH],"Hon, are you ready for some math problems?"
Cartman,"Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door."
[OTH],"Oh, all right."
Cartman,Mom?
[OTH],Yes?
Cartman,Could you turn up the heat just a little?
[OTH],"Sure, hon."
Cartman,"Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules. Yeeehhhhhhss!"
[OTH],"Oh, hel-lo."
[OTH],"Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,"
[OTH],"He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Woowould you like to come up to my room?
[OTH],"Uuuh, okay. Gah!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school."
[OTH],"Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?"
[OTH],"Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise."
[OTH],Alright.
[OTH],"Mark, where's your sister?"
[OTH],She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
[OTH],"Oh, alright."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Rebecca! Aaah! Aaaaah! Noo-hooo!
[OTH],"Rebecca, don't play that perverted game!"
[OTH],"I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses."
[OTH],Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling!
[OTH],"Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go."
[OTH],"Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go."
[OTH],You will?
[OTH],I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.
[OTH],"No no. I mean, go with me."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride."
Cartman,"Ahhhhhhhhh. Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired."
[OTH],"Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs."
Cartman,"Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom."
[OTH],"Eric, please. We have to do some studying today."
Cartman,"I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey."
[OTH],"Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?"
Cartman,"Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys."
[OTH],"Well, get your ass out of bed! We have to go deal with that home-school kid!"
Cartman,"Huh, I can't. I'm too tired. Maybe tomorrow."
[OTH],"(Hey, can I have that?) (Heey.)"
[OTH],But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
Cartman,That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
[OTH],"(Hey!) (Hey, Cartman, help me.)"
Cartman,"No, Fonics Monkey! No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!"
Cartman,"You're damn straight, he did."
[OTH],You got my note?
[OTH],Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?
[OTH],"Uh, can we sit down?"
[OTH],Wha-y noh-ot? Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it.
[OTH],"Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that... flicker of light over there?"
[OTH],I... have looked at it.
[OTH],"Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children, just like us."
[OTH],How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
[OTH],"From public school, your house is just a flicker of light. Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study"
[OTH],"Well, what else would one do?"
[OTH],"Love, for one thing."
[OTH],And woowhat is love?
[OTH],"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss."
[OTH],"Woowhat means ""ki-iss""?"
[OTH],When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
[OTH],"Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me."
[OTH],"Rebecca, in public school, we select our... own mate. In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy."
[OTH],"You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss. So I cold write about it. How do we do it?"
[OTH],I'm not completely sure.
[OTH],Should we... l-look it up?
[OTH],"No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right."
[OTH],"Wow. Wow, that was fun!"
[OTH],Dah. Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
[OTH],Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.
[OTH],"Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole."
[OTH],Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
[OTH],"That's the point, buttpipe."
[OTH],"Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!"
[OTH],"Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Hooray.
[OTH],"Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow."
[OTH],"Uh, why do we want to all chaperone the dance?"
[OTH],"Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
[OTH],The flagpole! That's great!
[OTH],Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help?"
[OTH],I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
[OTH],"Oh, brother!"
[OTH],"Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!"
[OTH],"You suck now, Kyle!"
[OTH],You suck!
[OTH],"Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio!"
[OTH],"Are you ready to rock, boys and girls?! I said, are you ready to rock?!"
[OTH],"Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess."
[OTH],"Then let's hit it! I know you all remember this one. It's off my first solo album. The song that you all helped me make number 1.

Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.Oh, what's-"
[OTH],"Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid! Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
[OTH],"Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister?"
[OTH],"Hi, guys."
[OTH],Woo-oh Holy Cow!
[OTH],"He-ey, baby. Come s-see me later, 'kay?"
[OTH],"What the-? Damn, baby."
[OTH],"Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?"
[OTH],Rebecca. You...
[OTH],"Rebecca, what the devil are you doing?"
[OTH],"I'm... having... fun, Mark."
[OTH],"Oh, my goodness!"
[OTH],You're out of control. You did this to my sister!
[OTH],Uh. All I did was show her how to-
[OTH],You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass!
[OTH],Ooww!
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!"
[OTH],Yeah. He's a badass!
[OTH],"Alright, alright, that's enough, boys."
[OTH],"...I'm not through with you, bitch!"
[OTH],"Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark."
[OTH],"Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too."
[OTH],"Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark?"
[OTH],No! He's my friend!
[OTH],"Eh, he said he'd hang out with me!"
[OTH],They've got to be here somewhere.
[OTH],"Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
[OTH],"Calm down, papá! Everything is all right. You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on. Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá."
[OTH],"Well, she sure is."
[OTH],"I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things."
[OTH],"Mark. You're absolutely right. Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Nice speech, nerdo."
[OTH],"Thanks, gaywad."
Cartman,Now you're gettin' it.
[OTH],"Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"See ya, papá!"
[OTH],"Well, I'm glad we all learned something today, kids. Now, let's dance!"
[OTH],"Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.
Oh, what's becoming of me? Like the tiger. You can see his stripes but you know he's clean.
Oh, don't you see what I mean?
Gotta get away, Holy Diver."
[OTH],"Eric, Mommy got you a present!"
Cartman,"A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!"
[OTH],"Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow."
Cartman,"Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do."
[OTH],"This year is gonna be different. Look! I got you ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics."""
Cartman,"What the hell is ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"""
[OTH],It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee. It says we just put the cassette into a tape player
[OTH],"Welcome to ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics,"" level 1. I will read the sounds and the monkey will help keep the beat. If your monkey arrived in the box dead, call 1-800-555-4500 to get a new monkey.

[OTH],"All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals! This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary."
[OTH],"Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks."
[OTH],You bet money on my son to win?!
[OTH],"Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew."
Cartman,"You're going down, bitch!"
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you."
Cartman,"Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon!"
[OTH],"And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds!"
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
[OTH],"Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!"
[OTH],"What's a ""home-schooled kid""?"
[OTH],"I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before."
[OTH],"Go, Mark! Go, Rebecca!"
[OTH],"Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school. All right, Mark. Your word is ""conscientious."""
Cartman,What?! What the fuck that that mean?
[OTH],"""Conscientious."" May I have the definition, please?"
[OTH],Closely attentive to details. Careful.
[OTH],"""Conscientious."" Could you use it in a sentence, please?"
[OTH],Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious.
[OTH],"""Conscientious."" C O N S C I E N T I O U S."
Cartman,Holy crap!
[OTH],"Way to go, Mark! Alright!"
[OTH],"Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman. Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr."
Cartman,"Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum! Come on!"
[OTH],"Eric, your word is ""chair."""
Cartman,Uuh. Definition?
[OTH],Something you sit on.
Cartman,Country of origin?
[OTH],English!
Cartman,Could you please use it in a sentence?
[OTH],"Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is ""chair""!!"
Cartman,"Uh- chair. C H A R E God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?! Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!"
[OTH],"All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school. Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral."
[OTH],"""Litoral."" Deh-finition?"
[OTH],Having to do with a lake or ocean.
[OTH],"""Litoral."" Will you please use it in a sentence?"
[OTH],Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
[OTH],"""Littoral."" L I T O R A L"
[OTH],Correct!
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Alright, Rebecca. Good job, honey."
[OTH],Now we have Kyle Broflovski. Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
[OTH],What??
[OTH],Krocsyldiphithic.
[OTH],Definition?
[OTH],Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.
[OTH],"Uh, could you use it in a sentence?"
[OTH],"Certainly. ""Krocsyldiphithic"" is a hard word to spell."
[OTH],"""Krocsyldiphic."""
[OTH],"You can do it, kid! You can do it!"
[OTH],"""Krocsyldiphic."" C Damnit!"
[OTH],"You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks. Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!"
[OTH],"Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca. You are truly South Park's finest."
[OTH],"Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart."
Cartman,Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth.
[OTH],What's your name?
[OTH],Guh what's in a name?
[OTH],Wooww.
[OTH],It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
Cartman,"Oh, yes. We must do it again."
[OTH],We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
[OTH],No. I live right over there. I've lived there all my life.
Cartman,How come you don't go to school?
[OTH],Because I'm home-schooled.
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
Cartman,You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
[OTH],Right.
Cartman,"Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?"
[OTH],"Shut up, Cartman?"
Cartman,"You shut up, butthole."
[OTH],"You shut up, gaywad!"
Cartman,"You shut up, ass-logger!"
[OTH],"Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?"
[OTH],"No, we're friends."
[OTH],"Strange, friends would call each other names and fight."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel."
[OTH],"Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos."
[OTH],Papa?
[OTH],"Yes, Mark?"
[OTH],Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous!"
[OTH],"But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá."
[OTH],"Mark, you have play time. You get to play in the afternoon."
[OTH],"I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like."
[OTH],"Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it."
[OTH],"Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days."
[OTH],"Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?"
[OTH],"Oh, heavens, no."
[OTH],"Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe!"
[OTH],"Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?"
[OTH],Yes she is.
[OTH],"...Uuh, can I talk to her?"
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I suppose so. Rebecca! This little boy wants to see you."
[OTH],Huhlo?
[OTH],"U-u-uh, hi."
[OTH],Hel-lo.
[OTH],"Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all."
[OTH],Who was that?
[OTH],A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.
[OTH],Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.
[OTH],"But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children."
[OTH],"Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close!"
[OTH],"Okay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark?"
[OTH],"Hey, guys. What's up?"
Cartman,"Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?"
[OTH],"Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America? Ehyes, Mark?"
Cartman,Ey! How come you never pick me?!
[OTH],"Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?"
[OTH],"The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade."
Cartman,"Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!"
[OTH],"Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards."
[OTH],"Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground."
[OTH],"Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from? Put your hand down, creampuff."
Cartman,That does it! I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
[OTH],"You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass."
Cartman,"I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled!"
[OTH],"Oh, please God, let it be forever."
[OTH],"Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me."""
[OTH],"But, if I say that, you'll hit me."
[OTH],"No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say ""Please, hit me,"" I won't hit you."
[OTH],"Please, hit me."
[OTH],All right.
[OTH],Ooowww!
[OTH],"Alright, we'll try this again, Pip."
[OTH],"I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time."
[OTH],"Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball."
[OTH],Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.
[OTH],"Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own."
[OTH],"Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench."
[OTH],You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
[OTH],"Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!"
[OTH],"Okay, let's get him..."
[OTH],Got it.
[OTH],"Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!"
[OTH],"Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!"
[OTH],"Oh, dear."
[OTH],"Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now."
[OTH],I'm sure he's alright.
[OTH],That must be him.
[OTH],Waaaaah!
[OTH],"Oh my God, son!"
[OTH],"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad."
[OTH],"Mark, what have they done to you?!"
[OTH],"Well, they duct-taped me to a bench."
[OTH],But why?
[OTH],"I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all."
[OTH],"Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!"
[OTH],"But I want to go back tomorrow, papá."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Please, just give me one more day."
[OTH],What do we do?
[OTH],"Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers."
[OTH],"Everywhere I go, I'm thinking of you, Rebecca. I don't know what to do, Rebecca. You're so nice, I'd like to get to know you better. So what do you say we get together?You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!Rebecca, you're really quite good-looking!You're a fox."
[OTH],"Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments. My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy."
[OTH],"Uh, look, Mr...."
[OTH],Cotswolds.
[OTH],"Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own."
[OTH],"Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better. And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop."
[OTH],"Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff."
[OTH],"Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?"
[OTH],"Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once."
[OTH],"I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!"
[OTH],"Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?"
[OTH],"No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers."
[OTH],You what??
[OTH],"See ya, Cotswolds. Thanks for stopping by."
[OTH],Yeah. See ya.
[OTH],...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
[OTH],Can I sit here with you?
[OTH],"Aw, man, if you have to."
[OTH],"Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early."
[OTH],Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
[OTH],"Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now."
[OTH],"(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)"
[OTH],Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
[OTH],"Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff."
[OTH],"I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?"
[OTH],"Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me."
[OTH],"Ah, dude, you don't say that."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Get him!
[OTH],"Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school."
[OTH],Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
Cartman,Eeehhh.
[OTH],Welcome to Huntin' and Killin with Jimbo and Ned.
Cartman,"Eehh, shut up. Ooohhh, yeasss."
[OTH],"Hon, are you ready for some math problems?"
Cartman,"Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door."
[OTH],"Oh, all right."
Cartman,Mom?
[OTH],Yes?
Cartman,Could you turn up the heat just a little?
[OTH],"Sure, hon."
Cartman,"Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules. Yeeehhhhhhss!"
[OTH],"Oh, hel-lo."
[OTH],"Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,"
[OTH],"He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Woowould you like to come up to my room?
[OTH],"Uuuh, okay. Gah!"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school."
[OTH],"Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?"
[OTH],"Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise."
[OTH],Alright.
[OTH],"Mark, where's your sister?"
[OTH],She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
[OTH],"Oh, alright."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Rebecca! Aaah! Aaaaah! Noo-hooo!
[OTH],"Rebecca, don't play that perverted game!"
[OTH],"I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses."
[OTH],Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling!
[OTH],"Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go."
[OTH],"Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go."
[OTH],You will?
[OTH],I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.
[OTH],"No no. I mean, go with me."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride."
Cartman,"Ahhhhhhhhh. Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired."
[OTH],"Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs."
Cartman,"Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom."
[OTH],"Eric, please. We have to do some studying today."
Cartman,"I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey."
[OTH],"Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?"
Cartman,"Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys."
[OTH],"Well, get your ass out of bed! We have to go deal with that home-school kid!"
Cartman,"Huh, I can't. I'm too tired. Maybe tomorrow."
[OTH],"(Hey, can I have that?) (Heey.)"
[OTH],But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
Cartman,That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
[OTH],"(Hey!) (Hey, Cartman, help me.)"
Cartman,"No, Fonics Monkey! No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!"
Cartman,"You're damn straight, he did."
[OTH],You got my note?
[OTH],Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?
[OTH],"Uh, can we sit down?"
[OTH],Wha-y noh-ot? Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it.
[OTH],"Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that... flicker of light over there?"
[OTH],I... have looked at it.
[OTH],"Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children, just like us."
[OTH],How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
[OTH],"From public school, your house is just a flicker of light. Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study"
[OTH],"Well, what else would one do?"
[OTH],"Love, for one thing."
[OTH],And woowhat is love?
[OTH],"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss."
[OTH],"Woowhat means ""ki-iss""?"
[OTH],When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
[OTH],"Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me."
[OTH],"Rebecca, in public school, we select our... own mate. In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy."
[OTH],"You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss. So I cold write about it. How do we do it?"
[OTH],I'm not completely sure.
[OTH],Should we... l-look it up?
[OTH],"No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right."
[OTH],"Wow. Wow, that was fun!"
[OTH],Dah. Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
[OTH],Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.
[OTH],"Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole."
[OTH],Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
[OTH],"That's the point, buttpipe."
[OTH],"Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!"
[OTH],"Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],Hooray.
[OTH],"Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow."
[OTH],"Uh, why do we want to all chaperone the dance?"
[OTH],"Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
[OTH],The flagpole! That's great!
[OTH],Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help?"
[OTH],I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
[OTH],"Oh, brother!"
[OTH],"Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!"
[OTH],"You suck now, Kyle!"
[OTH],You suck!
[OTH],"Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio!"
[OTH],"Are you ready to rock, boys and girls?! I said, are you ready to rock?!"
[OTH],"Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess."
[OTH],"Then let's hit it! I know you all remember this one. It's off my first solo album. The song that you all helped me make number 1.

Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.Oh, what's-"
[OTH],"Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid! Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
[OTH],"Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister?"
[OTH],"Hi, guys."
[OTH],Woo-oh Holy Cow!
[OTH],"He-ey, baby. Come s-see me later, 'kay?"
[OTH],"What the-? Damn, baby."
[OTH],"Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?"
[OTH],Rebecca. You...
[OTH],"Rebecca, what the devil are you doing?"
[OTH],"I'm... having... fun, Mark."
[OTH],"Oh, my goodness!"
[OTH],You're out of control. You did this to my sister!
[OTH],Uh. All I did was show her how to-
[OTH],You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass!
[OTH],Ooww!
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!"
[OTH],Yeah. He's a badass!
[OTH],"Alright, alright, that's enough, boys."
[OTH],"...I'm not through with you, bitch!"
[OTH],"Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark."
[OTH],"Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too."
[OTH],"Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark?"
[OTH],No! He's my friend!
[OTH],"Eh, he said he'd hang out with me!"
[OTH],They've got to be here somewhere.
[OTH],"Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
[OTH],"Calm down, papá! Everything is all right. You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on. Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá."
[OTH],"Well, she sure is."
[OTH],"I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things."
[OTH],"Mark. You're absolutely right. Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Nice speech, nerdo."
[OTH],"Thanks, gaywad."
Cartman,Now you're gettin' it.
[OTH],"Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!"
[OTH],Hooray!

Cartman,Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
[OTH],"Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!"
Cartman,"Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true!"
[OTH],We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.
[OTH],Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
[OTH],"Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar."
[OTH],"Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'."
[OTH],"Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here."
[OTH],"Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you."
[OTH],Uuh. Thanks.

[OTH],"Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him?"

[OTH],Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?

[OTH],Call those boys' mothers. I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.
[OTH],"Oh, no, dude!"
[OTH],"You know, Susan, the uh-there are so many great missionaries doing work, out there in in in-in parts of Africa, and uh we're trying to get Bibles to people all over the world. And what we need, is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects. Now, listen to this, Susan. Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it."
[OTH],Amazing.
[OTH],"Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ."
[OTH],What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?
[OTH],"Well, what we need, Susan, is we need money to build an interstellar cruiser. Now, this space ship will be able to travel through a wormhole and deliver the message and guh-glory of Jesus Christ to those godless aliens. S-send your money now. Amen."
[OTH],I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.

[OTH],Soaring so high above the world.

[OTH],"Uhnow, our deflector shields are useless against phorton torpedoes, and we really need your support on this one, folks. Here at the 600 Club we need your money to spread the Word of Jesus, and build more advanced deflector shields for our galactic cruiser. Call now, and we'll give you this free pin."
[OTH],Aaah.
[OTH],"You got 'em, Marvin."
[OTH],"Yeah, now finish 'em off!"
[OTH],Warning. Deflector shields failing.
[OTH],Where did that come from??
[OTH],Ho ho ho ho.

[OTH],Ho ho ho ho.
Cartman,It's Sally Struthers!
[OTH],"Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens."
[OTH],"Sorry, Marvin. We tried."
Cartman,Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
[OTH],Wo?
Cartman,"Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now."
[OTH],Holna chewbacca?
[OTH],"Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite."
[OTH],Dama doko nou na oh.
Cartman,"Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you."
[OTH],"Oh, foada!"
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,She bought it.
[OTH],Sally Struthers is saving us!
[OTH],"Uh, now, now, stay with me on this one, folks. Uh, Sally Struthers has a Tiberian junker , which is uh the favorite ship of the Hutts, and she has trapped oureh, our our new CBC ship in an uh poe-sitronic tractor beam. Uh, so we're gonna need an ionic tractor disruptor. Now now, not a regular ionic di- tractor disruptor, but a negative ionic tractor disruptor to uh, help spread the Word of Jesus. I don't have a fucking idea up here."
[OTH],Now's our chance!
Cartman,Wait. I remember. It was the red button!
[OTH],They've opened the wormhole!
[OTH],It's pulling us in!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Marvin...
[OTH],"Please, please, please. We are confused. You must explain one at a Marklar."
[OTH],"Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins."
[OTH],Who? Marklar?
[OTH],"We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us."
[OTH],Brought m- marklar??
[OTH],"What is ""marklar""?"
[OTH],Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar.
[OTH],Doesn't that get confusing?
[OTH],"Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!"
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],You see?
[OTH],"Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars."
[OTH],"Young marklar, your marklars are wise and true."

[OTH],"Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know."
[OTH],"Ah, Ms. Struthers."
[OTH],Oh ho ho ho. Un chaka solo david. Saime no Chewbacca dakaiminbi? ho ho.
[OTH],Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.
[OTH],Oh? Makarendae bi cho. Ho ho ho.
[OTH],We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him.
[OTH],Do ba kim.
[OTH],"Uh, heh-his name is Starving Marvin."
[OTH],Jonoba unko chocolate Yum Yum bar ancho?
[OTH],"Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers , and there are several more where that came from. Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy..."
[OTH],Mmmmo na ka!
[OTH],I'm... glad we can do business.
[OTH],"Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news."
Cartman,"Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this?"
[OTH],"Uh, God wants you to send us money. He needs you to send us money so we can help others."
Cartman,"Oh, my God, this guy again."
[OTH],Why would anybody send this asshole money?
[OTH],(To pay for the pockets on his peehole)
[OTH],Yeh-hah.
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,"Oh! Aww! Oh, weak!"
[OTH],Starvin' Marvin!
[OTH],Bongi groinit * *.
[OTH],He did take a ship.
Cartman,"Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!"
[OTH],Ingan *.
[OTH],"Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing."
[OTH],Chede gwodum * * godom.
[OTH],I think he wants us to get in.
[OTH],"Kick ass! Wow, this thing is awesome!"
[OTH],Let's go somewhere.
[OTH],"Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],Yes!
[OTH],"I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see."
[OTH],This is great!
Cartman,"Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off?"
[OTH],Gmmm?
[OTH],"Yeah, that's better."
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],Hello? Howare we doing today? Look what I got for you.
[OTH],Nn * wohg *?
[OTH],"No, it's not food. It's a cross. And it has your Christian name printed on it. From now on, you are Michael. Can you say ""Michael""? Mmmi-chael. Oh, well. You'll get it. Hello, brother David. Do you have any sins to confess? Anybody? Sins to confess? Joshua? You know, today I'm reminded of Psalm 46, line 39: ""Though the mountains shake and th-"""
[OTH],Here they are!
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!
[OTH],"Hello there, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here."
[OTH],"No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too."
[OTH],Blubedegub?
Cartman,"No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries."
[OTH],"Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world."
Cartman,"Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this?"
[OTH],Whooaaa!
[OTH],"What the hell did you hit, Cartman?!"
[OTH],"Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?!"
[OTH],Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
[OTH],Where are we?
[OTH],Gobin gobedo * * gowog.

[OTH],Greetings. Welcome to Marklar.
[OTH],"Uh, thanks."
[OTH],"I am Marklar, leader of the Marklar."
[OTH],"U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth."
[OTH],Marklar to you.
[OTH],Cool!
Cartman,Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
[OTH],"Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!"
Cartman,"Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true!"
[OTH],We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.
[OTH],Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
[OTH],"Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar."
[OTH],"Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'."
[OTH],"Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here."
[OTH],"Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you."
[OTH],Uuh. Thanks.
[OTH],* *.
[OTH],"Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him?"
[OTH],"We are the CIA. That ship needs to be with us! Maybe we should just take something precious of yours, huh?! Daha! This! This gourd-thingy, for instance. How do you like that, huh? If you ever wanna see this... little... thingy again, I suggest you contact your boy!"
[OTH],There it is!
[OTH],Muwuhbuh * * mlamleblubluh mjek.
[OTH],"Back away from the space craft, children!"
[OTH],"Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar."
[OTH],"Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there."
[OTH],Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?
Cartman,"No, never. It's perfect."
[OTH],"Ooh, no. Those poor souls. We must spread the Gospel to them."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],*. Mluglu dja mugm blugabeb * * *.
[OTH],"Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!"
[OTH],You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],Dor dor binor hm ghm.
[OTH],Call those boys' mothers. I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.
[OTH],"Oh, no, dude!"
[OTH],"You know, Susan, the uh-there are so many great missionaries doing work, out there in in in-in parts of Africa, and uh we're trying to get Bibles to people all over the world. And what we need, is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects. Now, listen to this, Susan. Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it."
[OTH],Amazing.
[OTH],"Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ."
[OTH],What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?
[OTH],"Well, what we need, Susan, is we need money to build an interstellar cruiser. Now, this space ship will be able to travel through a wormhole and deliver the message and guh-glory of Jesus Christ to those godless aliens. S-send your money now. Amen."
[OTH],I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.
[OTH],"E-excuse me, gentlemen, uh Tom Brokaw is here to see you."
[OTH],"Tom Brokaw? Oh no, the press already?"
[OTH],"Oh. Good day, gentlemen."
[OTH],"Uh huh. Mr. Brokaw, I presume."
[OTH],"You presume wisely, sir. I'm here to get the big story, the big scoop. I understand that you've found some kind of ship from an alien race. Seeing as though I am Pulitzer-prize-winning Tom Brokaw..."
[OTH],"Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw."
[OTH],What?! Do you question my integritah?!
[OTH],"I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!"
[OTH],"Buh-eh, ugh. I had some bad burritos today."
[OTH],"* * wughum chughum * *, * *."
[OTH],Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Son of a bitch!
[OTH],Run for it!
[OTH],Get 'em!
Cartman,"Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!"
[OTH],Watch out! Here I come!
[OTH],"(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-) (Oof.)"
[OTH],Kenny!
Cartman,Forget him! He's done for!
[OTH],"He's not done for, he's standing right there."
[OTH],"(You guys, just fly away!)"
Cartman,"No, no, he's done for. Come on!"
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],"Damnit, damnit, damnit!"
[OTH],"Alright, we made it!"
[OTH],"Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!"
[OTH],Gakchak ghm.
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],"This is the Missionary 600. We have you locked on ""fire: ready."" Turn back right now."
[OTH],Aaaa!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],They're shooting at us.
[OTH],"Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar."
[OTH],"Midik, gmanjaum * *."
[OTH],"Well, how'd we do it last time??"
[OTH],"Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself."
[OTH],"Which button did you press, Cartman??"
Cartman,U-u-huh. I don't remember.
[OTH],You don't remember?!
[OTH],"You dumbass, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one."
[OTH],Soaring so high above the world.
[OTH],Aawwww!
[OTH],Never-
[OTH],The ship seems to be made out of a... super-strong alloy. These lasers aren't powerful enough.
[OTH],"Everyone, the Word of God is going around the world and all your help is so greatly appreciated. Eh-oo What we need now is an argon crystal laser. Eh you see, an argon crystal laser can pierce thick space holes in a way that other lasers just can't. Send your money now. Uuh-I th-thank you."
[OTH],Onadonakami?
[OTH],"Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel."
[OTH],Chewmbacca vije dai gwo.
[OTH],We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology.
[OTH],Juodo nakahobi? Ho ho ho ho.
[OTH],"Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food."
[OTH],Wo? Wo chaka gom??
[OTH],"Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral."
[OTH],"(Oh my God, I get it.)"
[OTH],Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho.
[OTH],I have the infidels in my sight.
Cartman,Holy shit!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Doye dondabuh.
[OTH],Aaah.
[OTH],"Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes."
[OTH],"Uhnow, our deflector shields are useless against phorton torpedoes, and we really need your support on this one, folks. Here at the 600 Club we need your money to spread the Word of Jesus, and build more advanced deflector shields for our galactic cruiser. Call now, and we'll give you this free pin."
[OTH],Aaah.
[OTH],"You got 'em, Marvin."
[OTH],"Yeah, now finish 'em off!"
[OTH],Warning. Deflector shields failing.
[OTH],Where did that come from??
[OTH],Ho ho ho ho.
[OTH],Good! Now get them in our tractor beam!
[OTH],Now we've got 'em!
[OTH],Ho ho ho ho.
Cartman,It's Sally Struthers!
[OTH],"Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens."
[OTH],"Sorry, Marvin. We tried."
Cartman,Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
[OTH],Wo?
Cartman,"Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now."
[OTH],Holna chewbacca?
[OTH],"Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite."
[OTH],Dama doko nou na oh.
Cartman,"Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you."
[OTH],"Oh, foada!"
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,She bought it.
[OTH],Sally Struthers is saving us!
[OTH],"Uh, now, now, stay with me on this one, folks. Uh, Sally Struthers has a Tiberian junker , which is uh the favorite ship of the Hutts, and she has trapped oureh, our our new CBC ship in an uh poe-sitronic tractor beam. Uh, so we're gonna need an ionic tractor disruptor. Now now, not a regular ionic di- tractor disruptor, but a negative ionic tractor disruptor to uh, help spread the Word of Jesus. I don't have a fucking idea up here."
[OTH],Now's our chance!
Cartman,Wait. I remember. It was the red button!
[OTH],They've opened the wormhole!
[OTH],It's pulling us in!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Marvin...
[OTH],"Please, please, please. We are confused. You must explain one at a Marklar."
[OTH],"Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins."
[OTH],Who? Marklar?
[OTH],"We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us."
[OTH],Brought m- marklar??
[OTH],"What is ""marklar""?"
[OTH],Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar.
[OTH],Doesn't that get confusing?
[OTH],"Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!"
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],You see?
[OTH],"Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars."
[OTH],"Young marklar, your marklars are wise and true."
[OTH],What the hell did he say?
[OTH],"Wow! Good job, dude!"
[OTH],Thanks.
[OTH],The marklars can stay!
[OTH],Wooo!
[OTH],Alright!
Cartman,"Alright,"
[OTH],You marklars must leave.
[OTH],But you will all burn forever in eternal hellfire.
[OTH],"Yes, that's nice. Thank you for stopping by."
[OTH],"Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again."
[OTH],Chak chak glika gm gm guchab mglup.
[OTH],"No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth."
[OTH],Bwo chaaga bi.
[OTH],"Goodbye, Marvin."
[OTH],Chak chak m geteaub m * *.
[OTH],Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
Cartman,"Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh."
[OTH],Dude!
Cartman,What? We're not gonna come visit him.
[OTH],"I know, but you don't tell him that!"
Cartman,"T'heh, whatever."
[OTH],"I am Chewbacca
I am a Wookie
I am Chewbacca
I have no home
My home is where
My spirit goes"
[OTH],Ready? 1-2-3-4.
Cartman,"Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?! Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!"
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
Cartman,I'm playing the drum.
[OTH],"Well, you have to hit it softer!"
Cartman,"You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it! Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fucking drum!! That's how you rock, dude."
[OTH],"You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!"
Cartman,I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
[OTH],"That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!"
Cartman,"Ey, I'll get it!"
[OTH],"Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!"
Cartman,Yes I will!
[OTH],Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4.
Cartman,"Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damn it!"
[OTH],Cartman!!!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Give me the drum, and you play the flute."
Cartman,No way! Flutes are totally gay!
[OTH],(Flutes are gay?)
[OTH],"Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!"
Cartman,"Oh! Well, you know what I say?! Screw you guys, I'm going home!"
[OTH],You dick!
Cartman,Later.
[OTH],"Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield. First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!"
[OTH],"Yes! Woohoo, yea!"
[OTH],"Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment."
[OTH],He'll show.
[OTH],He'd better!
[OTH],"I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores."
[OTH],Whoa. Mmm.
[OTH],Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.
[OTH],"Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too."
[OTH],"And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh, the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924."
[OTH],"Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?"
[OTH],"Dude, that's not cool."
Cartman,"Good morning, gentlemen."
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
[OTH],Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
Cartman,"Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time."
[OTH],"You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!"
Cartman,"Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did."
[OTH],"Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead."
[OTH],"The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!"
Cartman,"Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win."
[OTH],"No they're not, stupid!"
Cartman,Yes we are!
[OTH],How much do you wanna bet?!
[OTH],"Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed."
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!"
Cartman,"Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month."
[OTH],And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
Cartman,Right.
[OTH],You're on!
Cartman,"Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield."
[OTH],Hoohoo what a dumbass!
[OTH],Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
[OTH],It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
[OTH],"...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!"
[OTH],"Yes! Woohoo, yea!"
[OTH],"Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, from the South ; in blue are the Union, from the North ."
[OTH],"It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle."
[OTH],Forward!
[OTH],Let's bring those Confederate bastards down!
[OTH],Fire!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright men, fire!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down."
[OTH],Ow.
[OTH],Yeh-hah!
[OTH],"Oh, so this is what it was like."
[OTH],Hey! What's that guy doing?!
Cartman,Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
[OTH],Huh? Wha-?
[OTH],What the hell?
[OTH],He took the bell!
[OTH],He can't do that!
[OTH],The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!
Cartman,Hooray for the South!
[OTH],"Cartman, you can't do that!"
[OTH],God dammit! Now we have to start over!
[OTH],"Alrighty everyone. We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time."
Cartman,But why? Why should they get the bell?
[OTH],"Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose."
Cartman,But we don't have to lose.
[OTH],What??
Cartman,"Gentlemen, we can win this battle! Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"""
[OTH],"By God, he's right!"
[OTH],Jimbo!
[OTH],"Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!"
[OTH],Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
[OTH],I'm tired of losing this battle!
[OTH],And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to-"
[OTH],Yaaaaah!
[OTH],Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day!
[OTH],"Uh, what are they doing?"
[OTH],You Yankee sons of bitches!
[OTH],Ow! That hurt!
[OTH],"God dammit, what the hell are they doing?!"
[OTH],What do we do?!
[OTH],"Run for your life, dude!"
Cartman,God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],Oh?
[OTH],"Surrender your men, general!"
[OTH],"Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!"
[OTH],"SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!"
[OTH],"Alright, alright. We surrender."
[OTH],The South win?
[OTH],The South wins!
[OTH],"Yeah, woohoo!"
[OTH],God dammit!
[OTH],"Well, we can all be friends now. Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps."
[OTH],"Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment."
[OTH],"Aw, come on. Have a little sip."
Cartman,"So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?"
[OTH],"You cheated, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!"
Cartman,I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot.
[OTH],All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
[OTH],"That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],You're dreaming!
Cartman,Perhaps we should take Topeka.
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah."
[OTH],They don't?!
Cartman,No. I say we take Topeka.
[OTH],You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
[OTH],I'll bet we could!
[OTH],"I'll bet we could, too!"
Cartman,I'll bet you can't.
[OTH],What?! Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
Cartman,"I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!"
[OTH],Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, the Union be damned!"
[OTH],Let's go!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month."
[OTH],"They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop."
Cartman,"Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens."
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Oh good morning, Mrs. Hollis."
[OTH],"Hello, Ralph."
[OTH],Did you happen to catch that ball game last night?
[OTH],I'm afraid I was grading papers pretty late and-
[OTH],"What's that noise, officer?"
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah!
[OTH],Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell!"
[OTH],"It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!"
[OTH],"Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store."
[OTH],WHERE?!
[OTH],"At the liquor store, at the liquor stohohohohore!"
[OTH],"Come on, boys!"
[OTH],This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
Cartman,Excuse meh.
[OTH],"Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas."
[OTH],"I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?"
[OTH],Oh here comes the bus. Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
[OTH],"Uh, conuh- Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield."
[OTH],What battlefield?!
[OTH],"Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see? Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not?"
Cartman,"Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee"
[OTH],"God dammit, that fat piece of shit!"
[OTH],Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
[OTH],That would suck so much ass.
[OTH],"We have to stop him, dude."
[OTH],"I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?"
[OTH],"Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch."
[OTH],We'll give you 10 bucks.
[OTH],"Oh. O-oh, okay."
[OTH],"...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news, a frightening radical group from Colorado is making its way across the Southern states of America. The group is recruiting new members in every town they pass through, and rapidly growing in number. So authorities have decided to call in the National Guard. The groups seems to be led by military mastermind and right-wing radical Jimbo Kern , who is known for his guerrilla-fighting and leadership skills."
[OTH],Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick. Blouach.
[OTH],"Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought."
[OTH],"Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed."
[OTH],Aaaaa!
[OTH],They say you can either fight them or join them.
[OTH],Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!
[OTH],"Dad, Dad. Mom wants you to come home."
[OTH],"Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging. Get over here!"
[OTH],"You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!"
[OTH],"This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!"
[OTH],Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!
[OTH],More schnapps!
[OTH],I'm Sgt. Larsen of the National Guard. We're here to stop the terrorists.
[OTH],"They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado."
[OTH],"Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins!"
[OTH],Sir!
[OTH],Fire a warning flare!
[OTH],Yes sir!
[OTH],Medic!
[OTH],Woops.
[OTH],"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],"We can't fire at them, sir. There are too many children."
[OTH],Then how do we stop them?
[OTH],I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
Cartman,"Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee."
[OTH],"There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home."
[OTH],"Nice thinkin', Billy."
[OTH],Let's go.
[OTH],"Where to next, General?"
Cartman,"Where did the Confederates go, son?"
[OTH],"Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated."
Cartman,"Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go."
[OTH],"Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?"
Cartman,Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
[OTH],"Um, sure. What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?"
[OTH],We're out of s'more schnapps?
[OTH],That can't be.
[OTH],I guess we drank it all.
[OTH],Now what?
[OTH],"Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Uugh.
[OTH],Ouch.
[OTH],"Oh, my head."
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],"Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had."
[OTH],"Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head."
[OTH],"Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today."
[OTH],"Me, too."
[OTH],"Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick."
Cartman,Where are you going?
[OTH],We're goin' home kid. Come on.
Cartman,"We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter!"
[OTH],"Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us."
Cartman,No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
[OTH],"Haha! You lose, fatass!"
Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!"
[OTH],"Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history. You see, history is forever, and everything happens for a reason. Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-"
[OTH],Where are you going?
Cartman,"This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot!"
[OTH],Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
[OTH],"Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here."
[OTH],"Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run?"
[OTH],"Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl. We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need."
[OTH],"Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff."
[OTH],Me neither.
Cartman,"Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw."
[OTH],"Yes, please. Do a shot out of my breasts."
[OTH],"Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order."
[OTH],"Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again!"
[OTH],"Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of ""grab ass."""
[OTH],"What's ""grab ass?"""
[OTH],You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
[OTH],"Ey, that sounds fun."
[OTH],Hohoho.
[OTH],I got you. Oo-oh.
Cartman,"Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take."
[OTH],You heard the General.
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh, no."
[OTH],We'll never stop them now.
[OTH],Woohoo!
Cartman,Yes! Yes!
[OTH],"Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action."
[OTH],And the Confederates won the fort?
[OTH],"Yes. Imagine what it must have been like: you're a Union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of Confederates ready to pounce on you. Uh..."
Cartman,Take the fort!
[OTH],Charge!
[OTH],"Yeah! Woohoo, yeah, come on!"
[OTH],We got it! The fort is ours!
[OTH],What was that??
[OTH],"Attention political activists: you are on government historical monument property! Surrender the monument with your hands up! If you would like a tour of the fort, one can be arranged through the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce."
[OTH],"Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here."
Cartman,Suck my ass!
[OTH],"What do we do, General? We're outnumbered."
Cartman,We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
[OTH],"Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up."
[OTH],"No, you can't do that. Our dads are there."
[OTH],"Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar."
[OTH],Hold it right there!
[OTH],"Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up!"
Cartman,I knew they would!
[OTH],"Aw, dammit!"
[OTH],We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy!
[OTH],Yee-haw! All right!
Cartman,Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
[OTH],"Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?!"
[OTH],"Oh boy, this doesn't look good."
[OTH],"It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people."
[OTH],Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists!
Cartman,"Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei."
[OTH],"Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands."
[OTH],"What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them."
[OTH],"As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?"
[OTH],My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol.
[OTH],Sir!
[OTH],I'm so glad I don't have your job.
[OTH],"Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves."
[OTH],"Dammit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!"
[OTH],"Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?"
[OTH],"Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson!"
[OTH],"All right, I'm gonna sign the document declarin' the Confederacy winners of the Civil War."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei."
Cartman,I don't. I made it up.
[OTH],Hey! Who's that?!
[OTH],"Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States."
[OTH],"Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy."
[OTH],"Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?"
Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?!
[OTH],"Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!"
[OTH],"Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],A whole year?
[OTH],"All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted."
[OTH],That's it? I-I don't have to sign this thing?
[OTH],"Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back."
Cartman,No! We still have to fight!
[OTH],"Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over."
Cartman,NOOO!!
[OTH],"It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!"
[OTH],Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off!
Cartman,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- -AAAH!
[OTH],"Boys, as President of the United States, I want to commend you for stopping the rebel uprising."
[OTH],Don't touch me.
[OTH],"Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!"
Cartman,"Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit!"
[OTH],"Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-"
Cartman,Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
[OTH],What??
Cartman,The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
[OTH],"Eh, he's right, boys. Slavery is illegal and immoral, partially in thanks to the North winning the Civil War."
[OTH],Awwww!
Cartman,Hahahaha haa ha!
[OTH],"Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home. Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Thanks, dick!"
[OTH],Ready? 1-2-3-4.
Cartman,"Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?! Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!"
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
Cartman,I'm playing the drum.
[OTH],"Well, you have to hit it softer!"
Cartman,"You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it! Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fucking drum!! That's how you rock, dude."
[OTH],"You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!"
Cartman,I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
[OTH],"That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!"
Cartman,"Ey, I'll get it!"
[OTH],"Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!"
Cartman,Yes I will!
[OTH],Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4.
Cartman,"Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damn it!"
[OTH],Cartman!!!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Give me the drum, and you play the flute."
Cartman,No way! Flutes are totally gay!
[OTH],(Flutes are gay?)
[OTH],"Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!"
Cartman,"Oh! Well, you know what I say?! Screw you guys, I'm going home!"
[OTH],You dick!
Cartman,Later.
[OTH],"Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield. First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!"
[OTH],"Yes! Woohoo, yea!"
[OTH],"Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment."
[OTH],He'll show.
[OTH],He'd better!
[OTH],"I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores."
[OTH],Whoa. Mmm.
[OTH],Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.
[OTH],"Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too."
[OTH],"And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh, the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924."
[OTH],"Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?"
[OTH],"Dude, that's not cool."
Cartman,"Good morning, gentlemen."
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
[OTH],Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
Cartman,"Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time."
[OTH],"You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!"
Cartman,"Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did."
[OTH],"Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead."
[OTH],"The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!"
Cartman,"Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win."
[OTH],"No they're not, stupid!"
Cartman,Yes we are!
[OTH],How much do you wanna bet?!
[OTH],"Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed."
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!"
Cartman,"Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month."
[OTH],And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
Cartman,Right.
[OTH],You're on!
Cartman,"Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield."
[OTH],Hoohoo what a dumbass!
[OTH],Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
[OTH],It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
[OTH],"...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!"
[OTH],"Yes! Woohoo, yea!"
[OTH],"Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, from the South ; in blue are the Union, from the North ."
[OTH],"It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle."
[OTH],Forward!
[OTH],Let's bring those Confederate bastards down!
[OTH],Fire!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright men, fire!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down."
[OTH],Ow.
[OTH],Yeh-hah!
[OTH],"Oh, so this is what it was like."
[OTH],Hey! What's that guy doing?!
Cartman,Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
[OTH],Huh? Wha-?
[OTH],What the hell?
[OTH],He took the bell!
[OTH],He can't do that!
[OTH],The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!
Cartman,Hooray for the South!
[OTH],"Cartman, you can't do that!"
[OTH],God dammit! Now we have to start over!
[OTH],"Alrighty everyone. We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time."
Cartman,But why? Why should they get the bell?
[OTH],"Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose."
Cartman,But we don't have to lose.
[OTH],What??
Cartman,"Gentlemen, we can win this battle! Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"""
[OTH],"By God, he's right!"
[OTH],Jimbo!
[OTH],"Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!"
[OTH],Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
[OTH],I'm tired of losing this battle!
[OTH],And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to-"
[OTH],Yaaaaah!
[OTH],Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day!
[OTH],"Uh, what are they doing?"
[OTH],You Yankee sons of bitches!
[OTH],Ow! That hurt!
[OTH],"God dammit, what the hell are they doing?!"
[OTH],What do we do?!
[OTH],"Run for your life, dude!"
Cartman,God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],Oh?
[OTH],"Surrender your men, general!"
[OTH],"Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!"
[OTH],"SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!"
[OTH],"Alright, alright. We surrender."
[OTH],The South win?
[OTH],The South wins!
[OTH],"Yeah, woohoo!"
[OTH],God dammit!
[OTH],"Well, we can all be friends now. Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps."
[OTH],"Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment."
[OTH],"Aw, come on. Have a little sip."
Cartman,"So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?"
[OTH],"You cheated, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!"
Cartman,I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot.
[OTH],All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
[OTH],"That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],You're dreaming!
Cartman,Perhaps we should take Topeka.
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah."
[OTH],They don't?!
Cartman,No. I say we take Topeka.
[OTH],You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
[OTH],I'll bet we could!
[OTH],"I'll bet we could, too!"
Cartman,I'll bet you can't.
[OTH],What?! Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
Cartman,"I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!"
[OTH],Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, the Union be damned!"
[OTH],Let's go!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month."
[OTH],"They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop."
Cartman,"Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens."
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Oh good morning, Mrs. Hollis."
[OTH],"Hello, Ralph."
[OTH],Did you happen to catch that ball game last night?
[OTH],I'm afraid I was grading papers pretty late and-
[OTH],"What's that noise, officer?"
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah!
[OTH],Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],"Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell!"
[OTH],"It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!"
[OTH],"Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store."
[OTH],WHERE?!
[OTH],"At the liquor store, at the liquor stohohohohore!"
[OTH],"Come on, boys!"
[OTH],This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
Cartman,Excuse meh.
[OTH],"Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas."
[OTH],"I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?"
[OTH],Oh here comes the bus. Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
[OTH],"Uh, conuh- Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield."
[OTH],What battlefield?!
[OTH],"Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see? Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not?"
Cartman,"Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee"
[OTH],"God dammit, that fat piece of shit!"
[OTH],Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
[OTH],That would suck so much ass.
[OTH],"We have to stop him, dude."
[OTH],"I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?"
[OTH],"Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch."
[OTH],We'll give you 10 bucks.
[OTH],"Oh. O-oh, okay."
[OTH],"...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news, a frightening radical group from Colorado is making its way across the Southern states of America. The group is recruiting new members in every town they pass through, and rapidly growing in number. So authorities have decided to call in the National Guard. The groups seems to be led by military mastermind and right-wing radical Jimbo Kern , who is known for his guerrilla-fighting and leadership skills."
[OTH],Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick. Blouach.
[OTH],"Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought."
[OTH],"Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed."
[OTH],Aaaaa!
[OTH],They say you can either fight them or join them.
[OTH],Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!
[OTH],"Dad, Dad. Mom wants you to come home."
[OTH],"Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging. Get over here!"
[OTH],"You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!"
[OTH],"This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!"
[OTH],Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!
[OTH],More schnapps!
[OTH],I'm Sgt. Larsen of the National Guard. We're here to stop the terrorists.
[OTH],"They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado."
[OTH],"Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins!"
[OTH],Sir!
[OTH],Fire a warning flare!
[OTH],Yes sir!
[OTH],Medic!
[OTH],Woops.
[OTH],"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],"We can't fire at them, sir. There are too many children."
[OTH],Then how do we stop them?
[OTH],I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
Cartman,"Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee."
[OTH],"There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home."
[OTH],"Nice thinkin', Billy."
[OTH],Let's go.
[OTH],"Where to next, General?"
Cartman,"Where did the Confederates go, son?"
[OTH],"Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated."
Cartman,"Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go."
[OTH],"Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?"
Cartman,Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
[OTH],"Um, sure. What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?"
[OTH],We're out of s'more schnapps?
[OTH],That can't be.
[OTH],I guess we drank it all.
[OTH],Now what?
[OTH],"Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Uugh.
[OTH],Ouch.
[OTH],"Oh, my head."
[OTH],Where am I?
[OTH],"Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had."
[OTH],"Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head."
[OTH],"Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today."
[OTH],"Me, too."
[OTH],"Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick."
Cartman,Where are you going?
[OTH],We're goin' home kid. Come on.
Cartman,"We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter!"
[OTH],"Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us."
Cartman,No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
[OTH],"Haha! You lose, fatass!"
Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!"
[OTH],"Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history. You see, history is forever, and everything happens for a reason. Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-"
[OTH],Where are you going?
Cartman,"This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot!"
[OTH],Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
[OTH],"Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here."
[OTH],"Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run?"
[OTH],"Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl. We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need."
[OTH],"Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff."
[OTH],Me neither.
Cartman,"Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw."
[OTH],"Yes, please. Do a shot out of my breasts."
[OTH],"Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order."
[OTH],"Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again!"
[OTH],"Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of ""grab ass."""
[OTH],"What's ""grab ass?"""
[OTH],You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
[OTH],"Ey, that sounds fun."
[OTH],Hohoho.
[OTH],I got you. Oo-oh.
Cartman,"Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take."
[OTH],You heard the General.
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh, no."
[OTH],We'll never stop them now.
[OTH],Woohoo!
Cartman,Yes! Yes!
[OTH],"Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action."
[OTH],And the Confederates won the fort?
[OTH],"Yes. Imagine what it must have been like: you're a Union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of Confederates ready to pounce on you. Uh..."
Cartman,Take the fort!
[OTH],Charge!
[OTH],"Yeah! Woohoo, yeah, come on!"
[OTH],We got it! The fort is ours!
[OTH],What was that??
[OTH],"Attention political activists: you are on government historical monument property! Surrender the monument with your hands up! If you would like a tour of the fort, one can be arranged through the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce."
[OTH],"Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here."
Cartman,Suck my ass!
[OTH],"What do we do, General? We're outnumbered."
Cartman,We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
[OTH],"Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up."
[OTH],"No, you can't do that. Our dads are there."
[OTH],"Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar."
[OTH],Hold it right there!
[OTH],"Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up!"
Cartman,I knew they would!
[OTH],"Aw, dammit!"
[OTH],We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy!
[OTH],Yee-haw! All right!
Cartman,Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
[OTH],"Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?!"
[OTH],"Oh boy, this doesn't look good."
[OTH],"It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people."
[OTH],Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists!
Cartman,"Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei."
[OTH],"Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands."
[OTH],"What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them."
[OTH],"As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?"
[OTH],My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol.
[OTH],Sir!
[OTH],I'm so glad I don't have your job.
[OTH],"Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves."
[OTH],"Dammit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!"
[OTH],"Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?"
[OTH],"Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson!"
[OTH],"All right, I'm gonna sign the document declarin' the Confederacy winners of the Civil War."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei."
Cartman,I don't. I made it up.
[OTH],Hey! Who's that?!
[OTH],"Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States."
[OTH],"Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy."
[OTH],"Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?"
Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?!
[OTH],"Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!"
[OTH],"Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering."
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],A whole year?
[OTH],"All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted."
[OTH],That's it? I-I don't have to sign this thing?
[OTH],"Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back."
Cartman,No! We still have to fight!
[OTH],"Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over."
Cartman,NOOO!!
[OTH],"It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!"
[OTH],Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off!
Cartman,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- -AAAH!
[OTH],"Boys, as President of the United States, I want to commend you for stopping the rebel uprising."
[OTH],Don't touch me.
[OTH],"Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!"
Cartman,"Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit!"
[OTH],"Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-"
Cartman,Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
[OTH],What??
Cartman,The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
[OTH],"Eh, he's right, boys. Slavery is illegal and immoral, partially in thanks to the North winning the Civil War."
[OTH],Awwww!
Cartman,Hahahaha haa ha!
[OTH],"Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home. Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Thanks, dick!"
[OTH],"Fighting the frizzies, at 11."

And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world."
[OTH],"Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah. This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song: I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play."
Cartman,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
[OTH],Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
Cartman,"Sure. Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay."

Cartman,"And...
O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah. It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie. Jesus was born, and so I get presents. Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o) Fall (Fall) On your knees (On your knees) And hear (Can't you hear)

[OTH],"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],(What?!)
[OTH],"Now, pay attention. Ahem...

I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday. And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about. And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout, Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,

Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
""Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you."" Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat."

And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world."
[OTH],"Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah. This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song: I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play."
Cartman,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
[OTH],Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?

Cartman,"And...
O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah. It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie. Jesus was born, and so I get presents. Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o) Fall (Fall) On your knees (On your knees) And hear (Can't you hear)

When I get presents (O-o) O night (O o-night) Di-viiine! O night (Ooo-ooo)
O night, di-vine! Oh. Ah. Ch."
[OTH],"Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison."
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],(What?!)
[OTH],"Now, pay attention. Ahem...

I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday. And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about. And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout, Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,

Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
""Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you."" Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"Frizzies, at 11."
[OTH],Howdy-ho!

On Christmas Day, in the morning?

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day The Virgin Mary and-
Shut up, TUUUURDS! -Christ were there

Cartman,Yes! I really did.
[OTH],How do you know?
Cartman,"Well, because yesterday I got my period."
[OTH],You got your what?
Cartman,"My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month."
[OTH],"You're making that up! Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?"
[OTH],"Well boys, ah-I don't think I can tell you. Ah-"
[OTH],"Please, it's important."
[OTH],"Well, it's when puberty hits and you bleed, you know, down there."
[OTH],"Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right!"
Cartman,"Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture. I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't."
[OTH],"Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us."
[OTH],"Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass."
[OTH],(Me too.)
[OTH],"In local news, a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children. Doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with simple antibiotics. Well, it's just four days until New Year's Eve, 1999. The new millennium is almost upon us, and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing one another. But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park. Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love. Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out!"
[OTH],"Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?"
[OTH],"He's neat, Mommy."
[OTH],"Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous. But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us!"
[OTH],"Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing? Can I help you with something?"

[OTH],We want to see God!
[OTH],"Yeah, with our own eyes."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!

[OTH],"Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],(Woohoo! Woohoooo!)
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's."
Cartman,"Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people. Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm. Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh. Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!"
[OTH],"(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)"
Cartman,You did?
[OTH],"You got your period too, Kenny?"
[OTH],"(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)"
Cartman,"Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve. But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear."
[OTH],(Woo-hoo!)
[OTH],"Tom, it looked for a second as if Jesus was going to come out of his house, but then he went back inside. But meanwhile, more and more people are showing up to show their support for Jesus."
[OTH],"Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible!"
[OTH],"Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me."
[OTH],"What is it, my child?"
[OTH],"Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!"
[OTH],"Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival."
[OTH],"It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you."
[OTH],"Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me."
[OTH],"But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback."
[OTH],"Be ye careful of pride, Jesus."
[OTH],"Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself."
[OTH],"Ike, can I talk to you?"
[OTH],"Uh ar, stufid."
[OTH],"Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!"
[OTH],Whoa won toooo-reeee.
[OTH],"Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore."
[OTH],No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog.
[OTH],"Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little."
[OTH],Cokeh mocker.
[OTH],"Thanks a lot, Ike!"
[OTH],So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
Cartman,"Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?"
[OTH],(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
Cartman,Tampon? What's a tampon?
[OTH],"(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)"
Cartman,"Ew, doesn't that hurt?"
[OTH],(A little.)
[OTH],"You guys! I got my period, too!"
Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],You did?
[OTH],"Yeah! I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place."
Cartman,"All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers."
[OTH],Awesome! We get powers?
Cartman,"Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve! Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others."
[OTH],"Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan"
[OTH],"Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!"
[OTH],"Oh God, you're smelly!"
[OTH],"Good morning, South Park, it's 8 a.m., and only two more days until the new millennium!"
[OTH],Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!
[OTH],"Stanley, honey, what's the matter?"
[OTH],I'm not bleeding out my aahass!
[OTH],"Well, that's good, honey."
[OTH],"No it's not! It's terrible! Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon."
[OTH],Here he comes!
[OTH],He's coming out!
[OTH],"...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium. I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded! So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going!"
[OTH],"...We knew you could do it, Jesus!"
[OTH],"Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas!"
[OTH],"For he is Savior
For he is Lord"
[OTH],"He gives me hope when
I have only been bored
And he lifts me up with
His gentle arm..."
Cartman,"Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?"
[OTH],Here.
Cartman,Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
[OTH],"(Dammit, here!)"
Cartman,"And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool."
[OTH],"I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde."
[OTH],"(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)"
Cartman,"Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first."
[OTH],Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
Cartman,"What's the matter, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh... Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly."
Cartman,"...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too."
[OTH],(And mine too.)
[OTH],Phew.
[OTH],"Oh, hello Stan."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How's it going?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],Can I come in?
[OTH],"Well, sure. Now, what's the matter, little cracker?"
[OTH],"Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't."
[OTH],"OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly."
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Your little girlfriend, Wendy."
[OTH],"Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't."
[OTH],"Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?"
[OTH],"Yeah, Cartman told us."
[OTH],"Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright now—I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?"
[OTH],"...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time."
[OTH],...Is that what I said?
[OTH],"But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it!"
[OTH],Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
[OTH],"I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock."
[OTH],"Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God."
[OTH],"Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now."
[OTH],Hullo-o-o.
[OTH],"Hey, Rod, great to see you."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!"
[OTH],Pooped pants.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Pooped pants.
[OTH],Poo pants?
[OTH],Pooped 'nmuh pants.
[OTH],"Uh, you pooped your pants?"
[OTH],Pooped in my pants.
[OTH],Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?
[OTH],"Again?! Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie?"
[OTH],"Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one."
[OTH],But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
[OTH],Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?
[OTH],"Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad."
[OTH],Your father never went through puberty?
[OTH],"No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself."
[OTH],"Oh, I can't say that I blame him."
[OTH],So do you know anything that can help him?
[OTH],"Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones."
[OTH],Hormones?
[OTH],"Yes! Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me."
[OTH],"Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best!"
[OTH],My pleasure. I just love helping people.
Cartman,"Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us."
[OTH],"Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh-"
[OTH],Hey assholes!
Cartman,"Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet."
[OTH],Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
[OTH],Hormones?
[OTH],"Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!"
[OTH],"Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones."
Cartman,"Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew."
[OTH],So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
Cartman,"Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go."
[OTH],Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones.
Cartman,"Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-"
[OTH],(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.)
Cartman,"Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-"
[OTH],(Oh- ooowww!)
Cartman,"Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!"
[OTH],(Aaaaaa!)
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Mr. and Ms. McCormick.
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.
[OTH],"Oh my God, my little Kenny's gone. I can't believe it."
[OTH],We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.
[OTH],"What happened? What killed him, doctor?"
[OTH],"Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank."
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.
[OTH],Gi-ih
[OTH],"We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show."
[OTH],Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas?
[OTH],"Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me. It looks as though Jesus really has come through. Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?"
[OTH],Of course he is. This is Jesus we're talking about. He wouldn't let us down.
[OTH],"Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow? ...Hello?"
[OTH],"Stanley. Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas."
[OTH],"Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs."
Cartman,"Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people."
[OTH],"Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?! Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it."
[OTH],"Hey, here comes Stan."
[OTH],Have I missed anything?
Cartman,"Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there."
[OTH],"Did you get your period yet, Stan?"
[OTH],"No. I didn't, but-"
Cartman,"Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas."
[OTH],"Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod ""Do You Think I'm Sexy?"" Stewart!"
[OTH],O-o-oh. O-oh. O-o-o-oh. Be-eh-o-o-or.
[OTH],"Whoa, man."
[OTH],Oh. Uh pooped 'em.
[OTH],This sucks balls!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, enough of this! Bring out God!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Oh no.
[OTH],We want God! We want God! We want God!
[OTH],"Please, Father. Do something."
[OTH],We want God!
[OTH],"Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight."
[OTH],We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
[OTH],"This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!"
[OTH],Let's get him!
[OTH],"Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as ""the gayest party ever."" Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
[OTH],"Jesus, why does God hate me?"
[OTH],"Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again."
[OTH],He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
[OTH],"Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you."
[OTH],"Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?"
[OTH],"Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems. A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence. That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party."
[OTH],I just wanted my period.
[OTH],"I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own. I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment."
[OTH],"Whoa, what is that??"
[OTH],It's Dad.
[OTH],God? God is going to show himself??
[OTH],"Look, I can see him."
[OTH],Father. You came.
[OTH],"Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me. Be ye not afraid. Blessed art thou, my children."
[OTH],That's God?
[OTH],"Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega. The Beginning and the End."
[OTH],"Well, yeah, but that??"
[OTH],"What did you expect me to look like, My son?"
[OTH],...Well not like that!
[OTH],"Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question."
[OTH],One question?
[OTH],Only one?
[OTH],What should we ask him?
[OTH],"We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, ""What's the meaning of life?"" or ""Why are we here?""."
[OTH],I have it. I have the question. Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?!
[OTH],"My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it."
[OTH],How do know that?
[OTH],"You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man — with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven."
[OTH],"Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??"
[OTH],"I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000."
[OTH],"Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before! Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay. I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?

Should auld acquaintance be forgot And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne..."
[OTH],Let's get him.
[OTH],"Let's have a cup o

-Aaaa!"
[OTH],"Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome."
[OTH],I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
Cartman,You guys! You guys! Guess what?
[OTH],"What, fatass?!"
Cartman,"I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys!"
[OTH],(...What?)
[OTH],No you didn't!
Cartman,Yes! I really did.
[OTH],How do you know?
Cartman,"Well, because yesterday I got my period."
[OTH],You got your what?
Cartman,"My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month."
[OTH],"You're making that up! Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?"
[OTH],"Well boys, ah-I don't think I can tell you. Ah-"
[OTH],"Please, it's important."
[OTH],"Well, it's when puberty hits and you bleed, you know, down there."
[OTH],"Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right!"
Cartman,"Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture. I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't."
[OTH],"Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us."
[OTH],"Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass."
[OTH],(Me too.)
[OTH],"In local news, a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children. Doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with simple antibiotics. Well, it's just four days until New Year's Eve, 1999. The new millennium is almost upon us, and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing one another. But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park. Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love. Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out!"
[OTH],"Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?"
[OTH],"He's neat, Mommy."
[OTH],"Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous. But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us!"
[OTH],"Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing? Can I help you with something?"
[OTH],"...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus."
[OTH],Uuh-huh?
[OTH],"Well, it's ""The Millennium""."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"So, what happens at the millennium?"
[OTH],...I don't know.
[OTH],We thought you did.
[OTH],"Yeah, you're supposed to know!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Yeah, you're Jesus."
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],You're the one in control.
[OTH],Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.
[OTH],"Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear somethin' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Well, what do ya want?"
[OTH],We want to see God!
[OTH],"Yeah, with our own eyes."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],That's right!
[OTH],"Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute."
[OTH],Is that good?
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],I don't know. Is that good or not?!
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Dude, did you get your period yet?"
[OTH],"No, there's no blood coming out of my ass."
[OTH],"Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty."
[OTH],"Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],(Woohoo! Woohoooo!)
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's."
Cartman,"Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people. Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm. Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh. Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!"
[OTH],"(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)"
Cartman,You did?
[OTH],"You got your period too, Kenny?"
[OTH],"(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)"
Cartman,"Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve. But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear."
[OTH],(Woo-hoo!)
[OTH],"Tom, it looked for a second as if Jesus was going to come out of his house, but then he went back inside. But meanwhile, more and more people are showing up to show their support for Jesus."
[OTH],"Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible!"
[OTH],"Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me."
[OTH],"What is it, my child?"
[OTH],"Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!"
[OTH],"Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival."
[OTH],"It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you."
[OTH],"Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me."
[OTH],"But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback."
[OTH],"Be ye careful of pride, Jesus."
[OTH],"Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself."
[OTH],"Ike, can I talk to you?"
[OTH],"Uh ar, stufid."
[OTH],"Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!"
[OTH],Whoa won toooo-reeee.
[OTH],"Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore."
[OTH],No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog.
[OTH],"Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little."
[OTH],Cokeh mocker.
[OTH],"Thanks a lot, Ike!"
[OTH],So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
Cartman,"Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?"
[OTH],(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
Cartman,Tampon? What's a tampon?
[OTH],"(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)"
Cartman,"Ew, doesn't that hurt?"
[OTH],(A little.)
[OTH],"You guys! I got my period, too!"
Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],You did?
[OTH],"Yeah! I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place."
Cartman,"All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers."
[OTH],Awesome! We get powers?
Cartman,"Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve! Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others."
[OTH],"Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan"
[OTH],"Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!"
[OTH],"Oh God, you're smelly!"
[OTH],"Good morning, South Park, it's 8 a.m., and only two more days until the new millennium!"
[OTH],Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!
[OTH],"Stanley, honey, what's the matter?"
[OTH],I'm not bleeding out my aahass!
[OTH],"Well, that's good, honey."
[OTH],"No it's not! It's terrible! Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon."
[OTH],Here he comes!
[OTH],He's coming out!
[OTH],"...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium. I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded! So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going!"
[OTH],"...We knew you could do it, Jesus!"
[OTH],"Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas!"
[OTH],"For he is Savior
For he is Lord"
[OTH],"He gives me hope when
I have only been bored
And he lifts me up with
His gentle arm..."
Cartman,"Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?"
[OTH],Here.
Cartman,Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
[OTH],"(Dammit, here!)"
Cartman,"And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool."
[OTH],"I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde."
[OTH],"(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)"
Cartman,"Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first."
[OTH],Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
Cartman,"What's the matter, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh... Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly."
Cartman,"...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too."
[OTH],(And mine too.)
[OTH],Phew.
[OTH],"Oh, hello Stan."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],How's it going?
[OTH],Bad.
[OTH],Why bad?
[OTH],Can I come in?
[OTH],"Well, sure. Now, what's the matter, little cracker?"
[OTH],"Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't."
[OTH],"OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly."
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Your little girlfriend, Wendy."
[OTH],"Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't."
[OTH],"Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?"
[OTH],"Yeah, Cartman told us."
[OTH],"Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright now—I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?"
[OTH],"...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time."
[OTH],...Is that what I said?
[OTH],"But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it!"
[OTH],Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
[OTH],"I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock."
[OTH],"Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God."
[OTH],"Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now."
[OTH],Hullo-o-o.
[OTH],"Hey, Rod, great to see you."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!"
[OTH],Pooped pants.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Pooped pants.
[OTH],Poo pants?
[OTH],Pooped 'nmuh pants.
[OTH],"Uh, you pooped your pants?"
[OTH],Pooped in my pants.
[OTH],Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?
[OTH],"Again?! Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie?"
[OTH],"Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one."
[OTH],But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
[OTH],Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?
[OTH],"Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad."
[OTH],Your father never went through puberty?
[OTH],"No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself."
[OTH],"Oh, I can't say that I blame him."
[OTH],So do you know anything that can help him?
[OTH],"Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones."
[OTH],Hormones?
[OTH],"Yes! Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me."
[OTH],"Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best!"
[OTH],My pleasure. I just love helping people.
Cartman,"Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us."
[OTH],"Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh-"
[OTH],Hey assholes!
Cartman,"Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet."
[OTH],Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
[OTH],Hormones?
[OTH],"Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!"
[OTH],"Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones."
Cartman,"Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew."
[OTH],So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
Cartman,"Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go."
[OTH],Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones.
Cartman,"Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-"
[OTH],(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.)
Cartman,"Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-"
[OTH],(Oh- ooowww!)
Cartman,"Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!"
[OTH],(Aaaaaa!)
[OTH],"Whoa, dude!"
[OTH],Mr. and Ms. McCormick.
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.
[OTH],"Oh my God, my little Kenny's gone. I can't believe it."
[OTH],We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.
[OTH],"What happened? What killed him, doctor?"
[OTH],"Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank."
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.
[OTH],Gi-ih
[OTH],"We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show."
[OTH],Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas?
[OTH],"Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me. It looks as though Jesus really has come through. Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?"
[OTH],Of course he is. This is Jesus we're talking about. He wouldn't let us down.
[OTH],"Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow? ...Hello?"
[OTH],"Stanley. Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas."
[OTH],"Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs."
Cartman,"Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people."
[OTH],"Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?! Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it."
[OTH],"Hey, here comes Stan."
[OTH],Have I missed anything?
Cartman,"Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there."
[OTH],"Did you get your period yet, Stan?"
[OTH],"No. I didn't, but-"
Cartman,"Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas."
[OTH],"Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod ""Do You Think I'm Sexy?"" Stewart!"
[OTH],O-o-oh. O-oh. O-o-o-oh. Be-eh-o-o-or.
[OTH],"Whoa, man."
[OTH],Oh. Uh pooped 'em.
[OTH],This sucks balls!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, enough of this! Bring out God!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Oh no.
[OTH],We want God! We want God! We want God!
[OTH],"Please, Father. Do something."
[OTH],We want God!
[OTH],"Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight."
[OTH],We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
[OTH],"This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!"
[OTH],Let's get him!
[OTH],"Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as ""the gayest party ever."" Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
[OTH],"Jesus, why does God hate me?"
[OTH],"Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again."
[OTH],He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
[OTH],"Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you."
[OTH],"Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?"
[OTH],"Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life."
[OTH],What do you mean?
[OTH],"If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems. A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence. That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party."
[OTH],I just wanted my period.
[OTH],"I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own. I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment."
[OTH],"Whoa, what is that??"
[OTH],It's Dad.
[OTH],God? God is going to show himself??
[OTH],"Look, I can see him."
[OTH],Father. You came.
[OTH],"Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me. Be ye not afraid. Blessed art thou, my children."
[OTH],That's God?
[OTH],"Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega. The Beginning and the End."
[OTH],"Well, yeah, but that??"
[OTH],"What did you expect me to look like, My son?"
[OTH],...Well not like that!
[OTH],"Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question."
[OTH],One question?
[OTH],Only one?
[OTH],What should we ask him?
[OTH],"We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, ""What's the meaning of life?"" or ""Why are we here?""."
[OTH],I have it. I have the question. Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?!
[OTH],"My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it."
[OTH],How do know that?
[OTH],"You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man — with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven."
[OTH],"Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??"
[OTH],"I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000."
[OTH],"Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before! Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay. I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?

[OTH],Let's get him.
[OTH],"Let's have a cup o

-Aaaa!"
[OTH],"This Saturday, Pox presents the musical event of the new millennium! You all remember playing the recorder in elementary school! Well, this Saturday in Oklahoma City , over 4 million third-grade students from all over the country will gather in one place, and at the same time, play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders. It's the largest third-grade recorder concert ever! Special guest conductor Yoko Ono and woodwind virtuoso Kenny G will lead this fantastic event! This Saturday, at 11 Eastern / 10 Central. The world will be watching!"
[OTH],"Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?! Recorders up. And a-1 and a-2 and a- ""...of liberty."" You're late! ""...my father-"" What the hell was that?! God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!"
Cartman,"That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long."
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass!"
Cartman,"Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh."
[OTH],"Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up. And a-1 and a-2 and a-"
[OTH],"M'kay, that sounded great, kids."
[OTH],"Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken."
[OTH],"M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas."
[OTH],Arkansas?
[OTH],What's Arkansas—is that a state?
[OTH],"Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?"
[OTH],M'kay.
[OTH],"Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me."
[OTH],What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
[OTH],Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there—my ...father still lives there.
[OTH],"Well, don't you want to see them?"
[OTH],I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
[OTH],"Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay? Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?"
[OTH],"...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me."
[OTH],When was that?
[OTH],"Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—"
[OTH],"M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy? Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me!"
Cartman,That was pretty cool.
[OTH],M'kay.
Cartman,"Okay, how about this one, Kenny?"
[OTH],(Uh-uh.)
Cartman,No? How about this?
[OTH],(Nope.)
Cartman,"Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this?"
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
Cartman,"We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control."
[OTH],"What's ""lose bowel control?"""
Cartman,That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
[OTH],"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!"
Cartman,Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
[OTH],Nuh-uh!
Cartman,"How about this one, Kenny?"
[OTH],(Nuh-uh.)
[OTH],"There is no brown noise, fat boy!"
Cartman,That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
[OTH],Who's Karen Carpenter?
[OTH],"Aaaaaah! Huhh, ohh,"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, are you alright?"
[OTH],Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.
[OTH],"M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!"
[OTH],M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
[OTH],"No! No, you moron! Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!"
[OTH],"M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!
[OTH],What did you say?!
[OTH],"You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!"
[OTH],"Why, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting.
[OTH],"I'm gonna kick your ass, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[OTH],BE QUIET BACK THERE!
[OTH],"Yuh-NO! You may have won this time, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!"
[OTH],School?
[OTH],Excuse me?
[OTH],What school are you from?
[OTH],"Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?"
[OTH],"Ssss, alright. South Park school, you go over there next to the kids from New York. Nono, don't put the Florida kids in the building!"
[OTH],Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves.
[OTH],"Yeah, huh?"
[OTH],"Whoa, look at this kid's coat. Ey, kid. What's the matter—you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What?"
[OTH],Who the hell are these guys?
[OTH],I didn't know they was invitin' rednecks to this event!
[OTH],We're not rednecks!
[OTH],"Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!"
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?!"
Cartman,"Stan, what's a queef?"
[OTH],Kenny?
[OTH],(I don't know!)
[OTH],"Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!"
Cartman,"Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!"
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well, what is it, then?!"
Cartman,Aaaa-
[OTH],Why?! Don't you know?!
[OTH],Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
[OTH],"Alright, dickhole!"
[OTH],"I need everyone's attention, please! We will now all be moving in an orderly fashion to our assigned hotels. Please follow your group leader to check in."
[OTH],"Yeah see ya later, queefs!"
[OTH],"Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere!"
[OTH],Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
[OTH],"Well, let's try the dictionary. queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef."
[OTH],Damnit!
Cartman,"Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!"
[OTH],You did?
[OTH],What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
Cartman,"I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise."""
[OTH],Awwgh!
[OTH],"Damnit Cartman, wha-?!"
Cartman,"""An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?"
[OTH],Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading!
[OTH],I can do this. I have to do this. Hello. Dad.
[OTH],"Oh, hello, son."
[OTH],Can I ...come in?
[OTH],"Ub. Sure, of course. Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?"
[OTH],"No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did."
[OTH],"Uh, what?"
[OTH],"I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things."
[OTH],"Uh, okay, like what?"
[OTH],"Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it! I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!"
[OTH],What??
[OTH],I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this!
[OTH],What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
[OTH],I know! I wanna know why not?!
[OTH],WHAT??
[OTH],Was it that I was ugly?!
[OTH],"Oh, my God!"
[OTH],"I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!"
[OTH],"Well, NO!!"
[OTH],"Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy!"
[OTH],"Alright, everyone, quiet please! There are over 4 million of you, so we must have quiet! At this time I would like to introduce the woman who is making this all possible, Yoko Ono!"
[OTH],"Please ... sing song ""My Country 'Tis of Thee."""
[OTH],"You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes."
[OTH],"Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means."
[OTH],"Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means."
[OTH],"No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em."
[OTH],Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
[OTH],What word could we make up?
[OTH],How about... finkleroy?
[OTH],"No, uhno, not finkleroy."
Cartman,"How about geebo, or, or mung?"
[OTH],"Yeah, mung."
[OTH],Mung's good.
[OTH],Sh. Here they come.
[OTH],"Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?"
[OTH],You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
[OTH],We're not mung. You're mung.
[OTH],"Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?"
[OTH],Of course we know what mung means!
[OTH],"Yeah, D'ya think we wouldn't know what mung means?"
[OTH],We busted you!
[OTH],Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up!
[OTH],You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is so a word!
[OTH],It is?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],It sure is.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
[OTH],Eewww.
[OTH],Ooogh.
[OTH],"You guys didn't know that? Come on, guys. Let's get away from these rednecks before we get redneckasitis, or somethin'!"
[OTH],"You dumbass, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!"
[OTH],"It's so nice to see you, son. I'm so proud that you're part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow."
[OTH],"Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about."
[OTH],About what?
[OTH],"Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?"
[OTH],That... that can't be.
[OTH],"He never did, Mom, not once."
[OTH],That's not true! Your father loved you! Often!
[OTH],"He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!"
[OTH],Nohoho! No! If I knew I would have made him do it!
[OTH],You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
[OTH],I'm not listening!
[OTH],"Face it, Mother. He never abused me!"
[OTH],"Uh, what's goin' on?"
[OTH],Mother won't hear the truth!
[OTH],He says you didn't molest him as a child!
[OTH],Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!
[OTH],No! I didn't know! I'm not listening!
[OTH],"You can't close your eyes forever, Mother! Mother, wait!"
[OTH],"Alright people, how many people has a copy. We must have-a practiced the ... song for the performance tomorrow, please."
[OTH],"Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here."
Cartman,"Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],And-a one gop seven to-sand ... O-o-o-o. Stop! Stop ... beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere. That was-a terrify! That was-a horri-bee! What we gonna do?!
[OTH],What the hell is that lady talking about?
[OTH],I have no idea.
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.?"
[OTH],"Thuh, that's me."
[OTH],"Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay."
[OTH],What can I do for ya?
[OTH],"Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay."
[OTH],"Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!"
[OTH],"Eh, you didn't?"
[OTH],No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!
[OTH],"Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different."
[OTH],"A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him."
[OTH],"Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about ""sexual molestation"", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality."
[OTH],I didn't do it because it's wrong!
[OTH],"I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him."
[OTH],Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year-old son?!
[OTH],"There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, ""How far will I go to save my son's life?"""
[OTH],"Well, I won't have sex with him!"
[OTH],"Well, I've said all I can say. I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay? Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison. Don't lose... your son, m'kay?"
[OTH],Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
[OTH],"Tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders. It is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history. Yoko Ono has..."
[OTH],"Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad."
[OTH],Good night.
[OTH],Words to live by.
[OTH],Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],"Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something."
[OTH],Should be fine.
[OTH],Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.
[OTH],Won't be necessary.
[OTH],I'll just... be going up to bed now. Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
[OTH],I'm not going to molest you!
[OTH],You don't love me! I wanna die!
[OTH],God-damnit!
[OTH],I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
[OTH],Yeah. They think they're so cool.
Cartman,"You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!"
[OTH],"Calm down, Cartman."
[OTH],You found what?
Cartman,"The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look. There, okay. Let's see here. Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?"
[OTH],"(Ready.) (Oh, shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom! )"
[OTH],No way.
[OTH],I don't believe it!
Cartman,"Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch. Okay."
[OTH],"Whoa- Oh, my God! Aaww, I crapped my pants!"
[OTH],That's amazing.
Cartman,I told you guys!
[OTH],"Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Cartman,That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
[OTH],No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
Cartman,Ooooh.
[OTH],"Yeah, dude!"
Cartman,"They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously."
[OTH],"Ey, what's the matter there, Garrison? You look kinda sad."
[OTH],"Well, I'm having some troubles at home."
[OTH],"Well, come on. Tell us about it. We always help each other out, don't we, fellas?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Yeah, that's right."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?"
[OTH],Sure!
[OTH],Yeah we are!
[OTH],I am. I know that.
[OTH],"Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?"
[OTH],Absolutely.
[OTH],Of course.
[OTH],"Yeah, man."
[OTH],"Come on, Garrison!"
[OTH],Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life?
[OTH],"...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it?"
[OTH],"Nono, I got a better one: Would you have sex with your mother... to save your father's life?"
[OTH],"Wooo, yeah."
[OTH],"Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him""?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Oh, that's a tough one."
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],"No no wait, uh, you don't understand."
[OTH],How about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life?
[OTH],"No, no, no way. No."
[OTH],"But if it was to save my mother's life, uh-I think I would have to have sex with my father."
[OTH],Yeup.
[OTH],"Me, too."
[OTH],"Well, I think that goes without saying."
[OTH],"Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son."
[OTH],"Well, personally, I would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life. It depends, uh- how big a gun are we talkin' here?"
[OTH],"Uh, he doesn't have a gun."
[OTH],The father doesn't have a gun?
[OTH],No! Nobody's got a gun!
[OTH],"I think if someone said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'm gonna kill your son,"" but he didn't have a gun, I wouldn't do it."
[OTH],"He could have a knife, though."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Yeah, a knife."
[OTH],"If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, ""Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you,"" ...I would have sex with myself."
[OTH],"...Yeah, I would"
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],That makes sense.
[OTH],Mm-hm.
[OTH],Wasn't that right?
[OTH],"Mm, See?"
[OTH],"How do we write the note, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this."
[OTH],"Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played. Come on. There. That should do it."
Cartman,"Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys."
[OTH],"Okay, let's get back to the room."
[OTH],"What's this?? ""Revised Music for Tomorrow""?? Chip, did you get revised music for tomorrow??"
[OTH],What??
[OTH],Ms. Ono has made revisions again! We've got to get these copied 4 million times and make the revisions to the projected music! Come on! Hurry!
[OTH],"Dad? Pop, I'm just fast asleep—I'm not hearing anything."
[OTH],"Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!"
[OTH],"Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon."
[OTH],"Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son?"
[OTH],"No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have."
[OTH],"Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again."
[OTH],"We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to."
[OTH],"We'll be watching on TV. Make us proud, son."
[OTH],"I will. Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad! Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face..."
[OTH],"You did the right thing, Poppa."
[OTH],"I didn't do squat! Here you go, a hundred bucks."
[OTH],"Oh, that's okay. Keep your money. Thanks."
[OTH],"Live, from Oklahoma City! Four million third-grade students from all over the country playing ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders... ""MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE"" special."
[OTH],"Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants."
[OTH],We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
[OTH],Are we all ready to play? Thanks. Okay. Let's see the music!
[OTH],This is gonna be sweet!
[OTH],"Oh no, dude. Look! It's the music we changed!"
Cartman,Uh-oh.
[OTH],"Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-"
[OTH],"One, two, sign paytah."
Cartman,No!
[OTH],Stop! Stop!
[OTH],"Uh, aren't those our boys?"
[OTH],"Oh, no. What are they doing?"
Cartman,Noooo!!!
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing in New York City, but it could just as well be any town on Earth right now. The desolation, the damage is exactly the same in every city the whole world over. It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick?"
[OTH],"Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere. Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, ""How did this happen?"""
[OTH],"Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well."
[OTH],"Wery well?! Wery well?! You're gonna be on Ricki Lake, I tell you again! Look at ad a bah godda circada she doin wery well?!"
[OTH],"Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Well, that whole experience sure did suck."
[OTH],"Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means."
[OTH],"Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Here they are!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here."
[OTH],Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
[OTH],Uuuuh...
[OTH],"Yeah, we knows all about it!"
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],You do?
[OTH],"Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shat themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing!"
[OTH],"Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry."
Cartman,"Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?"
[OTH],Yeah. See you guys later.
[OTH],"Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus. Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G."
[OTH],"Huhuh, good- good-bye."
[OTH],"M-m-m. Oh, well, thank you! You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad. Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home."
[OTH],Which way should we go?
[OTH],"Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning."
[OTH],"This Saturday, Pox presents the musical event of the new millennium! You all remember playing the recorder in elementary school! Well, this Saturday in Oklahoma City , over 4 million third-grade students from all over the country will gather in one place, and at the same time, play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders. It's the largest third-grade recorder concert ever! Special guest conductor Yoko Ono and woodwind virtuoso Kenny G will lead this fantastic event! This Saturday, at 11 Eastern / 10 Central. The world will be watching!"
[OTH],"Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?! Recorders up. And a-1 and a-2 and a- ""...of liberty."" You're late! ""...my father-"" What the hell was that?! God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!"
Cartman,"That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long."
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass!"
Cartman,"Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh."
[OTH],"Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up. And a-1 and a-2 and a-"
[OTH],"M'kay, that sounded great, kids."
[OTH],"Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken."
[OTH],"M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas."
[OTH],Arkansas?
[OTH],What's Arkansas—is that a state?
[OTH],"Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?"
[OTH],M'kay.
[OTH],"Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me."
[OTH],What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
[OTH],Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there—my ...father still lives there.
[OTH],"Well, don't you want to see them?"
[OTH],I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
[OTH],"Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay? Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?"
[OTH],"...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me."
[OTH],When was that?
[OTH],"Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—"
[OTH],"M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy? Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me!"
Cartman,That was pretty cool.
[OTH],M'kay.
Cartman,"Okay, how about this one, Kenny?"
[OTH],(Uh-uh.)
Cartman,No? How about this?
[OTH],(Nope.)
Cartman,"Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this?"
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
Cartman,"We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control."
[OTH],"What's ""lose bowel control?"""
Cartman,That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
[OTH],"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!"
Cartman,Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
[OTH],Nuh-uh!
Cartman,"How about this one, Kenny?"
[OTH],(Nuh-uh.)
[OTH],"There is no brown noise, fat boy!"
Cartman,That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
[OTH],Who's Karen Carpenter?
[OTH],"Aaaaaah! Huhh, ohh,"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, are you alright?"
[OTH],Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.
[OTH],"M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!"
[OTH],M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
[OTH],"No! No, you moron! Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!"
[OTH],"M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!
[OTH],What did you say?!
[OTH],"You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!"
[OTH],"Why, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting.
[OTH],"I'm gonna kick your ass, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[OTH],BE QUIET BACK THERE!
[OTH],"Yuh-NO! You may have won this time, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!"
[OTH],School?
[OTH],Excuse me?
[OTH],What school are you from?
[OTH],"Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?"
[OTH],"Ssss, alright. South Park school, you go over there next to the kids from New York. Nono, don't put the Florida kids in the building!"
[OTH],Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves.
[OTH],"Yeah, huh?"
[OTH],"Whoa, look at this kid's coat. Ey, kid. What's the matter—you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What?"
[OTH],Who the hell are these guys?
[OTH],I didn't know they was invitin' rednecks to this event!
[OTH],We're not rednecks!
[OTH],"Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!"
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?!"
Cartman,"Stan, what's a queef?"
[OTH],Kenny?
[OTH],(I don't know!)
[OTH],"Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!"
Cartman,"Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!"
[OTH],"Oh yeah? Well, what is it, then?!"
Cartman,Aaaa-
[OTH],Why?! Don't you know?!
[OTH],Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
[OTH],"Alright, dickhole!"
[OTH],"I need everyone's attention, please! We will now all be moving in an orderly fashion to our assigned hotels. Please follow your group leader to check in."
[OTH],"Yeah see ya later, queefs!"
[OTH],"Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere!"
[OTH],Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
[OTH],"Well, let's try the dictionary. queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef."
[OTH],Damnit!
Cartman,"Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!"
[OTH],You did?
[OTH],What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
Cartman,"I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise."""
[OTH],Awwgh!
[OTH],"Damnit Cartman, wha-?!"
Cartman,"""An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?"
[OTH],Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading!
[OTH],I can do this. I have to do this. Hello. Dad.
[OTH],"Oh, hello, son."
[OTH],Can I ...come in?
[OTH],"Ub. Sure, of course. Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?"
[OTH],"No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did."
[OTH],"Uh, what?"
[OTH],"I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things."
[OTH],"Uh, okay, like what?"
[OTH],"Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it! I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!"
[OTH],What??
[OTH],I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this!
[OTH],What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
[OTH],I know! I wanna know why not?!
[OTH],WHAT??
[OTH],Was it that I was ugly?!
[OTH],"Oh, my God!"
[OTH],"I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!"
[OTH],"Well, NO!!"
[OTH],"Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy!"
[OTH],"Alright, everyone, quiet please! There are over 4 million of you, so we must have quiet! At this time I would like to introduce the woman who is making this all possible, Yoko Ono!"
[OTH],"Please ... sing song ""My Country 'Tis of Thee."""
[OTH],"You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes."
[OTH],"Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means."
[OTH],"Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means."
[OTH],"No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em."
[OTH],Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
[OTH],What word could we make up?
[OTH],How about... finkleroy?
[OTH],"No, uhno, not finkleroy."
Cartman,"How about geebo, or, or mung?"
[OTH],"Yeah, mung."
[OTH],Mung's good.
[OTH],Sh. Here they come.
[OTH],"Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?"
[OTH],You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
[OTH],We're not mung. You're mung.
[OTH],"Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?"
[OTH],Of course we know what mung means!
[OTH],"Yeah, D'ya think we wouldn't know what mung means?"
[OTH],We busted you!
[OTH],Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up!
[OTH],You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is so a word!
[OTH],It is?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],It sure is.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
[OTH],Eewww.
[OTH],Ooogh.
[OTH],"You guys didn't know that? Come on, guys. Let's get away from these rednecks before we get redneckasitis, or somethin'!"
[OTH],"You dumbass, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!"
[OTH],"It's so nice to see you, son. I'm so proud that you're part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow."
[OTH],"Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about."
[OTH],About what?
[OTH],"Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?"
[OTH],That... that can't be.
[OTH],"He never did, Mom, not once."
[OTH],That's not true! Your father loved you! Often!
[OTH],"He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!"
[OTH],Nohoho! No! If I knew I would have made him do it!
[OTH],You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
[OTH],I'm not listening!
[OTH],"Face it, Mother. He never abused me!"
[OTH],"Uh, what's goin' on?"
[OTH],Mother won't hear the truth!
[OTH],He says you didn't molest him as a child!
[OTH],Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!
[OTH],No! I didn't know! I'm not listening!
[OTH],"You can't close your eyes forever, Mother! Mother, wait!"
[OTH],"Alright people, how many people has a copy. We must have-a practiced the ... song for the performance tomorrow, please."
[OTH],"Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here."
Cartman,"Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],And-a one gop seven to-sand ... O-o-o-o. Stop! Stop ... beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere. That was-a terrify! That was-a horri-bee! What we gonna do?!
[OTH],What the hell is that lady talking about?
[OTH],I have no idea.
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.?"
[OTH],"Thuh, that's me."
[OTH],"Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay."
[OTH],What can I do for ya?
[OTH],"Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay."
[OTH],"Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!"
[OTH],"Eh, you didn't?"
[OTH],No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!
[OTH],"Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different."
[OTH],"A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him."
[OTH],"Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about ""sexual molestation"", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality."
[OTH],I didn't do it because it's wrong!
[OTH],"I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him."
[OTH],Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year-old son?!
[OTH],"There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, ""How far will I go to save my son's life?"""
[OTH],"Well, I won't have sex with him!"
[OTH],"Well, I've said all I can say. I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay? Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison. Don't lose... your son, m'kay?"
[OTH],Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
[OTH],"Tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders. It is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history. Yoko Ono has..."
[OTH],"Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad."
[OTH],Good night.
[OTH],Words to live by.
[OTH],Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],"Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something."
[OTH],Should be fine.
[OTH],Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.
[OTH],Won't be necessary.
[OTH],I'll just... be going up to bed now. Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
[OTH],I'm not going to molest you!
[OTH],You don't love me! I wanna die!
[OTH],God-damnit!
[OTH],I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
[OTH],Yeah. They think they're so cool.
Cartman,"You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!"
[OTH],"Calm down, Cartman."
[OTH],You found what?
Cartman,"The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look. There, okay. Let's see here. Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?"
[OTH],"(Ready.) (Oh, shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom! )"
[OTH],No way.
[OTH],I don't believe it!
Cartman,"Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch. Okay."
[OTH],"Whoa- Oh, my God! Aaww, I crapped my pants!"
[OTH],That's amazing.
Cartman,I told you guys!
[OTH],"Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Cartman,That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
[OTH],No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
Cartman,Ooooh.
[OTH],"Yeah, dude!"
Cartman,"They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously."
[OTH],"Ey, what's the matter there, Garrison? You look kinda sad."
[OTH],"Well, I'm having some troubles at home."
[OTH],"Well, come on. Tell us about it. We always help each other out, don't we, fellas?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Yeah, that's right."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?"
[OTH],Sure!
[OTH],Yeah we are!
[OTH],I am. I know that.
[OTH],"Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?"
[OTH],Absolutely.
[OTH],Of course.
[OTH],"Yeah, man."
[OTH],"Come on, Garrison!"
[OTH],Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life?
[OTH],"...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it?"
[OTH],"Nono, I got a better one: Would you have sex with your mother... to save your father's life?"
[OTH],"Wooo, yeah."
[OTH],"Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him""?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Oh, that's a tough one."
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],"No no wait, uh, you don't understand."
[OTH],How about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life?
[OTH],"No, no, no way. No."
[OTH],"But if it was to save my mother's life, uh-I think I would have to have sex with my father."
[OTH],Yeup.
[OTH],"Me, too."
[OTH],"Well, I think that goes without saying."
[OTH],"Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son."
[OTH],"Well, personally, I would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life. It depends, uh- how big a gun are we talkin' here?"
[OTH],"Uh, he doesn't have a gun."
[OTH],The father doesn't have a gun?
[OTH],No! Nobody's got a gun!
[OTH],"I think if someone said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'm gonna kill your son,"" but he didn't have a gun, I wouldn't do it."
[OTH],"He could have a knife, though."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],"Yeah, a knife."
[OTH],"If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, ""Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you,"" ...I would have sex with myself."
[OTH],"...Yeah, I would"
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],That makes sense.
[OTH],Mm-hm.
[OTH],Wasn't that right?
[OTH],"Mm, See?"
[OTH],"How do we write the note, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this."
[OTH],"Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played. Come on. There. That should do it."
Cartman,"Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys."
[OTH],"Okay, let's get back to the room."
[OTH],"What's this?? ""Revised Music for Tomorrow""?? Chip, did you get revised music for tomorrow??"
[OTH],What??
[OTH],Ms. Ono has made revisions again! We've got to get these copied 4 million times and make the revisions to the projected music! Come on! Hurry!
[OTH],"Dad? Pop, I'm just fast asleep—I'm not hearing anything."
[OTH],"Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!"
[OTH],"Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon."
[OTH],"Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son?"
[OTH],"No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have."
[OTH],"Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again."
[OTH],"We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to."
[OTH],"We'll be watching on TV. Make us proud, son."
[OTH],"I will. Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad! Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face..."
[OTH],"You did the right thing, Poppa."
[OTH],"I didn't do squat! Here you go, a hundred bucks."
[OTH],"Oh, that's okay. Keep your money. Thanks."
[OTH],"Live, from Oklahoma City! Four million third-grade students from all over the country playing ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders... ""MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE"" special."
[OTH],"Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants."
[OTH],We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
[OTH],Are we all ready to play? Thanks. Okay. Let's see the music!
[OTH],This is gonna be sweet!
[OTH],"Oh no, dude. Look! It's the music we changed!"
Cartman,Uh-oh.
[OTH],"Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-"
[OTH],"One, two, sign paytah."
Cartman,No!
[OTH],Stop! Stop!
[OTH],"Uh, aren't those our boys?"
[OTH],"Oh, no. What are they doing?"
Cartman,Noooo!!!
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing in New York City, but it could just as well be any town on Earth right now. The desolation, the damage is exactly the same in every city the whole world over. It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick?"
[OTH],"Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere. Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, ""How did this happen?"""
[OTH],"Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well."
[OTH],"Wery well?! Wery well?! You're gonna be on Ricki Lake, I tell you again! Look at ad a bah godda circada she doin wery well?!"
[OTH],"Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Well, that whole experience sure did suck."
[OTH],"Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means."
[OTH],"Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],Here they are!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here."
[OTH],Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
[OTH],Uuuuh...
[OTH],"Yeah, we knows all about it!"
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],You do?
[OTH],"Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shat themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing!"
[OTH],"Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry."
Cartman,"Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?"
[OTH],Yeah. See you guys later.
[OTH],"Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus. Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G."
[OTH],"Huhuh, good- good-bye."
[OTH],"M-m-m. Oh, well, thank you! You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad. Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home."
[OTH],Which way should we go?
[OTH],"Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning."
Cartman,Mom! MOOOM! Mom! Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
[OTH],"What is it, snookums?"
Cartman,"Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars! She's only given me a lousy quarter before!"
[OTH],Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
Cartman,Yeah! This is so tits!
[OTH],"Don't say ""tits,"" Eric."
Cartman,"Oh, I mean, this is so cool!"
[OTH],"Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest."
Cartman,"Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard!"
[OTH],"But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving."
Cartman,"Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later! Aw, man, this is so tits!"
Cartman,"Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this! Oh my God, you guys, seriously! Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich! Aren't you stoked?!"
[OTH],What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
[OTH],He's fat and he's stupid?
Cartman,Look what the tooth fairy left me last night!
[OTH],Two dollars!
[OTH],No way!
[OTH],For one tooth?
Cartman,For one tooth.
[OTH],"Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter."
[OTH],I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
Cartman,"Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits."
[OTH],...Totally what?
Cartman,"Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a Sega Dreamcast."
[OTH],Sega Dreamcast??
Cartman,All we need is teeth.
[OTH],I already lost all my baby teeth.
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],(Nuh-uh.)
[OTH],"You still have baby teeth, Kenny?"
[OTH],(No way!)
Cartman,"Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a Sega Dreamcast?"
[OTH],(No I don't! Thank you.)
Cartman,"Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!"
[OTH],"Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?"
[OTH],"Almost. You ready, Timmy?"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],Right. You're Timmy.
[OTH],Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!
[OTH],(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
Cartman,"I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us. ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny."
[OTH],(Fuck you!)
[OTH],"Alright! Get ready, Timmy."
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?"
[OTH],"What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's."
[OTH],"Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here."
Cartman,You what?
[OTH],(You what?)
[OTH],Timmih-
[OTH],Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
[OTH],"Uh, Butters, could we have it?"
[OTH],"Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth."
[OTH],Ha-a-ugh.
[OTH],"Well, uh, see ya, fellas."
[OTH],"Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth."
[OTH],"Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth."
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
Cartman,How are we gonna get it from him?
[OTH],I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
[OTH],"Yeah, let's go."
[OTH],"Go! Timmy go! Yeah, Timmy!"
[OTH],"No, Timmy, wait!"
[OTH],Engh go uh Timmy!
[OTH],"(Hey, guys!) (Heey-ungh) (Oowww.)"
Cartman,"Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha."
[OTH],Hu-aah!
Cartman,"Higher, you guys."
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?"
Cartman,"Agh! Careful, you assholes! To the left, you guys, left. No, camera left, camera left! That's it, now down."
[OTH],What the-? Who's there? Who is that?!
Cartman,"I am the tooth fairy, my child."
[OTH],"Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see?"
Cartman,Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow.
[OTH],"Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat."
Cartman,Ey!
[OTH],"Come on, fatass!"
Cartman,Do not open your eyes until morning. Or else I will kick you in the nuts. Square in the nuts.
[OTH],"Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!"
[OTH],Well?
Cartman,Bull's eye!
[OTH],"Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night."
Cartman,"I love that song, Mom. Sing it again."
[OTH],"No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight."
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"Good night. What do you have there, Eric?"
Cartman,Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
[OTH],"Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days."
Cartman,"I know, huh?"
Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys! Holy crap, you guys! I mean-"
[OTH],Did the tooth fairy come?
Cartman,Four dollars.
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],Four dollars?
[OTH],"(Oh, my God!)"
Cartman,Do you what this means?
[OTH],Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow.
[OTH],Dentist office.
[OTH],"Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman."
[OTH],"Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?"
[OTH],"Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried."
[OTH],"Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?"
[OTH],About a hundred and twelve.
[OTH],...A hundred and twelve.
[OTH],Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
[OTH],"Your son wouldn't happen to be an ""alligator,"" would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it."
[OTH],"O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,Tih- Tooth? What the hell? Mom!
[OTH],"Yes, Eric"
Cartman,"You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!"
[OTH],"Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down. Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month."
Cartman,"You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh... M- Mom?"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later."
Cartman,Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
[OTH],"No, honey. It's just-"
Cartman,"How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?"
[OTH],"Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child."
Cartman,"How can I trust you? How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself. Myself and Willikins Bear, of course."
[OTH],"Eric! Eric, wait!"
Cartman,"No, Mother! No more lies!"
[OTH],"Dude, where's the money?"
Cartman,There is no money.
[OTH],No more money??
[OTH],"What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!"
Cartman,I know!
[OTH],"Cartman, what's going on?!"
Cartman,"You guys... Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this."
[OTH],Tell us what?!
Cartman,"You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it."
[OTH],"What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?"""
Cartman,"My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money."
[OTH],Dude.
[OTH],That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
Cartman,"But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny. Don't touch me, Kenny."
[OTH],"You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!"
Cartman,"Kyle, open your eyes, man!"
[OTH],It's not true!
[OTH],"Oh, hello, son."
[OTH],"Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?"
[OTH],"What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk."
[OTH],Oh my God! You did lie to me.
[OTH],"No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan."
[OTH],"Peter Pan, too??"
[OTH],Kyle...
[OTH],What about Moses and Abraham?
[OTH],"Well, they were probably real."
[OTH],Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
[OTH],Probably not.
[OTH],Wahahahah!
[OTH],"Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children."
[OTH],"Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah!"
Cartman,"Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy."
[OTH],What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
Cartman,"No, man, that's just a TV show."
[OTH],You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
Cartman,"What? That your parents lied to you, too?"
[OTH],"Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!"
Cartman,How?
[OTH],"Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?"
[OTH],All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
[OTH],"So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!"
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],The kid will never even know.
Cartman,"Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, what if I'm not real?"
[OTH],We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],"I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?"
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle!"
[OTH],What if this is all just somebody's dream?
Cartman,"Wow, look at the size of these houses!"
[OTH],"Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the ""Tooth Fairy."""
Cartman,"Hey, that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there."
[OTH],"There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it."
Cartman,Got it.
[OTH],This is the smartest business venture ever.
Cartman,What the-?
[OTH],"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!"
[OTH],"We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him."
[OTH],"...Hey, you can't do that!"
[OTH],Why not?!
[OTH],Because that's what we're doing!
Cartman,Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
[OTH],What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
[OTH],Two years?
[OTH],Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!
Cartman,It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
[OTH],How dare you!
[OTH],"Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!"
[OTH],You scram! We were here first!
[OTH],What's going on? Oh! It's the tooth fairies!
[OTH],"Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up!"
[OTH],You woke him up!
[OTH],"I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy."
[OTH],Shut up!
[OTH],"Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!"
[OTH],Who's the Boss?
[OTH],Loogie.
[OTH],My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?
[OTH],"Uuh, yeah."
[OTH],"Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre- Erp."
Cartman,We were there first!
[OTH],"Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years. I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that."
[OTH],Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
[OTH],Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?
[OTH],"Well, uh-what do you mean?"
[OTH],How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow?
[OTH],Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
[OTH],"What's a ""tooth trade?"""
[OTH],"Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved. We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months. Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see. This is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow. Once the note is in place in the last house, we start all over, going back to the first house. But this time, all we have to do is collect money. And the kids never know what hit 'em."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries , hockey games , anywhere we can find them"
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],"The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality. But there's never enough teeth. Never enough."
[OTH],Amazing.
Cartman,"Man, that is tits!"
[OTH],"And now my only problem is, what do I do with you?"
[OTH],Rowwr!
[OTH],Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?
[OTH],Oh. Uh-I don't know.
[OTH],"It's that, or else I can cut off your penises."
Cartman,"Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see..."
[OTH],Cartman!
[OTH],How much do we get if we work for you?
[OTH],I'll cut you in at 2%.
Cartman,"Two percent, have my penis cut off. Two percent-"
[OTH],We're in!
[OTH],"Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this. A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra , and that it-"
[OTH],"Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory."
[OTH],"...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!"
[OTH],I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit.
[OTH],"Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds."
[OTH],It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.
[OTH],Where?!
[OTH],In Montreal.
[OTH],"And where, pray, is this ""Montreal""?!"
[OTH],"Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!"
[OTH],"Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand."
[OTH],"Well, I will!"
[OTH],"Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device."
[OTH],"Here! Here, over here, look! Look what I got- I got from the chef!"
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],We all want double-desserts today!
[OTH],"Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that."
Cartman,"Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang."
[OTH],Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
Cartman,"That's right. Keep the change, my man."
[OTH],"Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were- Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!"
[OTH],"That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called ""college."""
[OTH],That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs.
[OTH],"Ooo, come on, now."
[OTH],"Hey, kid. You wanna try some dope?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Come on, kid. Don't you wanna get high?"
[OTH],"Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me sing you a little song:

I can't wait until I grow up
and my weenie get big and strong
'Cause when it does I'm gonna bust
And make love to you Amanda all night long
I'm gonna make love to y'Amanda in about ten years!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What the hell is he talking about?
[OTH],"And that toothpick is gonna turn into an oak tree,..."
[OTH],"U-uh, Chef."
[OTH],"I'ma knock ya down, knock ya up,..."
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],"...knock ya over, an' knock ya all around."
[OTH],CHEF!
[OTH],Uh?
[OTH],We're not dealing drugs!
[OTH],You're not?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but... Ooh, uh-oh, never mind."
[OTH],"Thanks, Chef."
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],"Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up."
[OTH],"Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!"
Cartman,"Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?"
[OTH],"We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses."
Cartman,"Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!"
[OTH],"Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality."
Cartman,"Sure, Kyle."
[OTH],"They're what?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground! Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em."
[OTH],"Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association."
[OTH],"Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti?"
[OTH],"No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you."
[OTH],I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.
[OTH],I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass!
Cartman,"So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China."
[OTH],"That's right, yeah . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?"
Cartman,How much?
[OTH],"Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh?"
Cartman,"Can I ask you a question, Weasel?"
[OTH],"Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure."
Cartman,Do you think I'm an idiot?
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?! Get out of my sight! Lousy little scum! What?!"
[OTH],"This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!"
Cartman,I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you!
[OTH],"Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one."
[OTH],He's not gonna do it?!
[OTH],(He's not gonna do it?!)
[OTH],"He's not gonna do it, boss!"
[OTH],"Well then, throw him in."
[OTH],"Alright, kid. Time to die."
[OTH],(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!)
[OTH],"Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?"
[OTH],"...to which Ms. Clinton replied, ""I don't even like Vagina."" Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant or he will most certainly die. Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant?"
[OTH],"Sih, six hundred dollar-."
[OTH],"Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!"
[OTH],Duh six hundred dohollars.
[OTH],"Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left?"
[OTH],"Well, I a-I don't know."
[OTH],"Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today."
[OTH],Yehahah.
[OTH],"Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it!"
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yes, really. Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom. How was that?"
[OTH],Perfect. The trap is set.
[OTH],"Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?"
Cartman,"Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together! This is gonna be tits!"
[OTH],"Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?"
Cartman,Will somebody take those books away from him?
[OTH],"Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy."
[OTH],"Okay-y, Mom."
[OTH],"Thank you for helping out, gentlemen. If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it?"
[OTH],Got it.
[OTH],"Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss? Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh."
Cartman,"Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does."
[OTH],"I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!"
[OTH],"Dude, just stop thinking about it."
[OTH],"But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together?"
[OTH],"(You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)"
[OTH],"Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down, and my own existence fading."
[OTH],"G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad."
[OTH],"Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled."
[OTH],"I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?"
[OTH],"I think so, Billy. I think so."
[OTH],"Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again."
Cartman,"Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!"
[OTH],"Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave. Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening!"
[OTH],Kyle?
[OTH],Eh something strange is happening with the computers.
[OTH],"Well, well, well. What do we have here?"
[OTH],"Aw, shit."
[OTH],"Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski , put this buttwipe out of his misery."
Cartman,I got it!
[OTH],The tooth fairy!
[OTH],Let's move out!
[OTH],"Aw, drat!"
[OTH],"Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists."
[OTH],It was a trap!
[OTH],That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison!
[OTH],"This is reality! I am everywhere , and nowhere."
[OTH],What the hell?
Cartman,Kyle?
[OTH],"I am nothing, and everything."
[OTH],"Well, I told you!"
[OTH],Let's get outta here!
[OTH],Hunh. That was pretty weird.
[OTH],Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along! How could I be so stupid?!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
Cartman,"Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face."
[OTH],Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen.
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways.
[OTH],So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
[OTH],"Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with."
[OTH],"Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us."
Cartman,...Tits.
[OTH],Timmy!
Cartman,Mom! MOOOM! Mom! Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
[OTH],"What is it, snookums?"
Cartman,"Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars! She's only given me a lousy quarter before!"
[OTH],Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
Cartman,Yeah! This is so tits!
[OTH],"Don't say ""tits,"" Eric."
Cartman,"Oh, I mean, this is so cool!"
[OTH],"Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest."
Cartman,"Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard!"
[OTH],"But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving."
Cartman,"Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later! Aw, man, this is so tits!"
Cartman,"Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this! Oh my God, you guys, seriously! Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich! Aren't you stoked?!"
[OTH],What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
[OTH],He's fat and he's stupid?
Cartman,Look what the tooth fairy left me last night!
[OTH],Two dollars!
[OTH],No way!
[OTH],For one tooth?
Cartman,For one tooth.
[OTH],"Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter."
[OTH],I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
Cartman,"Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits."
[OTH],...Totally what?
Cartman,"Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a Sega Dreamcast."
[OTH],Sega Dreamcast??
Cartman,All we need is teeth.
[OTH],I already lost all my baby teeth.
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],(Nuh-uh.)
[OTH],"You still have baby teeth, Kenny?"
[OTH],(No way!)
Cartman,"Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a Sega Dreamcast?"
[OTH],(No I don't! Thank you.)
Cartman,"Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!"
[OTH],"Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?"
[OTH],"Almost. You ready, Timmy?"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],Right. You're Timmy.
[OTH],Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!
[OTH],(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
Cartman,"I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us. ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny."
[OTH],(Fuck you!)
[OTH],"Alright! Get ready, Timmy."
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?"
[OTH],"What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's."
[OTH],"Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here."
Cartman,You what?
[OTH],(You what?)
[OTH],Timmih-
[OTH],Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
[OTH],"Uh, Butters, could we have it?"
[OTH],"Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth."
[OTH],Ha-a-ugh.
[OTH],"Well, uh, see ya, fellas."
[OTH],"Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth."
[OTH],"Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth."
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
Cartman,How are we gonna get it from him?
[OTH],I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
[OTH],"Yeah, let's go."
[OTH],"Go! Timmy go! Yeah, Timmy!"
[OTH],"No, Timmy, wait!"
[OTH],Engh go uh Timmy!
[OTH],"(Hey, guys!) (Heey-ungh) (Oowww.)"
Cartman,"Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha."
[OTH],Hu-aah!
Cartman,"Higher, you guys."
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?"
Cartman,"Agh! Careful, you assholes! To the left, you guys, left. No, camera left, camera left! That's it, now down."
[OTH],What the-? Who's there? Who is that?!
Cartman,"I am the tooth fairy, my child."
[OTH],"Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see?"
Cartman,Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow.
[OTH],"Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat."
Cartman,Ey!
[OTH],"Come on, fatass!"
Cartman,Do not open your eyes until morning. Or else I will kick you in the nuts. Square in the nuts.
[OTH],"Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!"
[OTH],Well?
Cartman,Bull's eye!
[OTH],"Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night."
Cartman,"I love that song, Mom. Sing it again."
[OTH],"No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight."
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"Good night. What do you have there, Eric?"
Cartman,Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
[OTH],"Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days."
Cartman,"I know, huh?"
Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys! Holy crap, you guys! I mean-"
[OTH],Did the tooth fairy come?
Cartman,Four dollars.
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],Four dollars?
[OTH],"(Oh, my God!)"
Cartman,Do you what this means?
[OTH],Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow.
[OTH],Dentist office.
[OTH],"Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman."
[OTH],"Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?"
[OTH],"Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried."
[OTH],"Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?"
[OTH],About a hundred and twelve.
[OTH],...A hundred and twelve.
[OTH],Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
[OTH],"Your son wouldn't happen to be an ""alligator,"" would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it."
[OTH],"O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,Tih- Tooth? What the hell? Mom!
[OTH],"Yes, Eric"
Cartman,"You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!"
[OTH],"Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down. Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month."
Cartman,"You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh... M- Mom?"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later."
Cartman,Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
[OTH],"No, honey. It's just-"
Cartman,"How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?"
[OTH],"Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child."
Cartman,"How can I trust you? How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself. Myself and Willikins Bear, of course."
[OTH],"Eric! Eric, wait!"
Cartman,"No, Mother! No more lies!"
[OTH],"Dude, where's the money?"
Cartman,There is no money.
[OTH],No more money??
[OTH],"What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!"
Cartman,I know!
[OTH],"Cartman, what's going on?!"
Cartman,"You guys... Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this."
[OTH],Tell us what?!
Cartman,"You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it."
[OTH],"What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?"""
Cartman,"My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money."
[OTH],Dude.
[OTH],That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
Cartman,"But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny. Don't touch me, Kenny."
[OTH],"You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!"
Cartman,"Kyle, open your eyes, man!"
[OTH],It's not true!
[OTH],"Oh, hello, son."
[OTH],"Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?"
[OTH],"What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk."
[OTH],Oh my God! You did lie to me.
[OTH],"No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan."
[OTH],"Peter Pan, too??"
[OTH],Kyle...
[OTH],What about Moses and Abraham?
[OTH],"Well, they were probably real."
[OTH],Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
[OTH],Probably not.
[OTH],Wahahahah!
[OTH],"Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children."
[OTH],"Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah!"
Cartman,"Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy."
[OTH],What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
Cartman,"No, man, that's just a TV show."
[OTH],You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
Cartman,"What? That your parents lied to you, too?"
[OTH],"Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!"
Cartman,How?
[OTH],"Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?"
[OTH],All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
[OTH],"So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!"
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],The kid will never even know.
Cartman,"Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, what if I'm not real?"
[OTH],We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],"I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?"
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle!"
[OTH],What if this is all just somebody's dream?
Cartman,"Wow, look at the size of these houses!"
[OTH],"Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the ""Tooth Fairy."""
Cartman,"Hey, that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there."
[OTH],"There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it."
Cartman,Got it.
[OTH],This is the smartest business venture ever.
Cartman,What the-?
[OTH],"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!"
[OTH],"We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him."
[OTH],"...Hey, you can't do that!"
[OTH],Why not?!
[OTH],Because that's what we're doing!
Cartman,Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
[OTH],What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
[OTH],Two years?
[OTH],Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!
Cartman,It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
[OTH],How dare you!
[OTH],"Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!"
[OTH],You scram! We were here first!
[OTH],What's going on? Oh! It's the tooth fairies!
[OTH],"Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up!"
[OTH],You woke him up!
[OTH],"I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy."
[OTH],Shut up!
[OTH],"Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!"
[OTH],Who's the Boss?
[OTH],Loogie.
[OTH],My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?
[OTH],"Uuh, yeah."
[OTH],"Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre- Erp."
Cartman,We were there first!
[OTH],"Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years. I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that."
[OTH],Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
[OTH],Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?
[OTH],"Well, uh-what do you mean?"
[OTH],How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow?
[OTH],Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
[OTH],"What's a ""tooth trade?"""
[OTH],"Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved. We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months. Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see. This is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow. Once the note is in place in the last house, we start all over, going back to the first house. But this time, all we have to do is collect money. And the kids never know what hit 'em."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries , hockey games , anywhere we can find them"
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],"The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality. But there's never enough teeth. Never enough."
[OTH],Amazing.
Cartman,"Man, that is tits!"
[OTH],"And now my only problem is, what do I do with you?"
[OTH],Rowwr!
[OTH],Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?
[OTH],Oh. Uh-I don't know.
[OTH],"It's that, or else I can cut off your penises."
Cartman,"Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see..."
[OTH],Cartman!
[OTH],How much do we get if we work for you?
[OTH],I'll cut you in at 2%.
Cartman,"Two percent, have my penis cut off. Two percent-"
[OTH],We're in!
[OTH],"Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this. A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra , and that it-"
[OTH],"Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory."
[OTH],"...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!"
[OTH],I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit.
[OTH],"Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds."
[OTH],It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.
[OTH],Where?!
[OTH],In Montreal.
[OTH],"And where, pray, is this ""Montreal""?!"
[OTH],"Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!"
[OTH],"Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand."
[OTH],"Well, I will!"
[OTH],"Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device."
[OTH],"Here! Here, over here, look! Look what I got- I got from the chef!"
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],We all want double-desserts today!
[OTH],"Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that."
Cartman,"Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang."
[OTH],Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
Cartman,"That's right. Keep the change, my man."
[OTH],"Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were- Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!"
[OTH],"That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called ""college."""
[OTH],That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs.
[OTH],"Ooo, come on, now."
[OTH],"Hey, kid. You wanna try some dope?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Come on, kid. Don't you wanna get high?"
[OTH],"Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me sing you a little song:

I can't wait until I grow up
and my weenie get big and strong
'Cause when it does I'm gonna bust
And make love to you Amanda all night long
I'm gonna make love to y'Amanda in about ten years!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What the hell is he talking about?
[OTH],"And that toothpick is gonna turn into an oak tree,..."
[OTH],"U-uh, Chef."
[OTH],"I'ma knock ya down, knock ya up,..."
[OTH],Chef!
[OTH],"...knock ya over, an' knock ya all around."
[OTH],CHEF!
[OTH],Uh?
[OTH],We're not dealing drugs!
[OTH],You're not?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but... Ooh, uh-oh, never mind."
[OTH],"Thanks, Chef."
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],"Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up."
[OTH],"Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!"
Cartman,"Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?"
[OTH],"We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses."
Cartman,"Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!"
[OTH],"Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality."
Cartman,"Sure, Kyle."
[OTH],"They're what?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground! Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em."
[OTH],"Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association."
[OTH],"Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti?"
[OTH],"No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you."
[OTH],I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.
[OTH],I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass!
Cartman,"So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China."
[OTH],"That's right, yeah . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?"
Cartman,How much?
[OTH],"Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh?"
Cartman,"Can I ask you a question, Weasel?"
[OTH],"Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure."
Cartman,Do you think I'm an idiot?
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?! Get out of my sight! Lousy little scum! What?!"
[OTH],"This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!"
Cartman,I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you!
[OTH],"Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one."
[OTH],He's not gonna do it?!
[OTH],(He's not gonna do it?!)
[OTH],"He's not gonna do it, boss!"
[OTH],"Well then, throw him in."
[OTH],"Alright, kid. Time to die."
[OTH],(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!)
[OTH],"Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?"
[OTH],"...to which Ms. Clinton replied, ""I don't even like Vagina."" Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant or he will most certainly die. Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant?"
[OTH],"Sih, six hundred dollar-."
[OTH],"Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!"
[OTH],Duh six hundred dohollars.
[OTH],"Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left?"
[OTH],"Well, I a-I don't know."
[OTH],"Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today."
[OTH],Yehahah.
[OTH],"Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it!"
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],"Yes, really. Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom. How was that?"
[OTH],Perfect. The trap is set.
[OTH],"Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?"
Cartman,"Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together! This is gonna be tits!"
[OTH],"Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?"
Cartman,Will somebody take those books away from him?
[OTH],"Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy."
[OTH],"Okay-y, Mom."
[OTH],"Thank you for helping out, gentlemen. If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it?"
[OTH],Got it.
[OTH],"Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss? Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh."
Cartman,"Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does."
[OTH],"I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!"
[OTH],"Dude, just stop thinking about it."
[OTH],"But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together?"
[OTH],"(You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)"
[OTH],"Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down, and my own existence fading."
[OTH],"G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad."
[OTH],"Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled."
[OTH],"I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?"
[OTH],"I think so, Billy. I think so."
[OTH],"Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again."
Cartman,"Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!"
[OTH],"Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave. Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening!"
[OTH],Kyle?
[OTH],Eh something strange is happening with the computers.
[OTH],"Well, well, well. What do we have here?"
[OTH],"Aw, shit."
[OTH],"Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski , put this buttwipe out of his misery."
Cartman,I got it!
[OTH],The tooth fairy!
[OTH],Let's move out!
[OTH],"Aw, drat!"
[OTH],"Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists."
[OTH],It was a trap!
[OTH],That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison!
[OTH],"This is reality! I am everywhere , and nowhere."
[OTH],What the hell?
Cartman,Kyle?
[OTH],"I am nothing, and everything."
[OTH],"Well, I told you!"
[OTH],Let's get outta here!
[OTH],Hunh. That was pretty weird.
[OTH],Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along! How could I be so stupid?!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
Cartman,"Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face."
[OTH],Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen.
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways.
[OTH],So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
[OTH],"Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with."
[OTH],"Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us."
Cartman,...Tits.
[OTH],Timmy!
[OTH],Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
[OTH],Ready!
[OTH],On your marks! Get set! Uh-go!
[OTH],We win again!
[OTH],That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat, Tolkien!"
[OTH],"We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!"
[OTH],Sleds are for guys.
Cartman,Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
[OTH],"These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!"
[OTH],"Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!"
[OTH],Oh yeah?!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
[OTH],"How about a race down a real hill, then?!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],You got it!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
[OTH],No problem!
[OTH],Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
[OTH],Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
[OTH],"See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!"
[OTH],"Oh, boy! We'll show them!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are."
[OTH],"Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!"
Cartman,"Tolkien, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock!"
[OTH],Fatass.
Cartman,There!
[OTH],Oh!
Cartman,Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
[OTH],"And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?"
[OTH],"Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?"
Cartman,"I'm sorry, Mom."
[OTH],"Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!"
Cartman,"I'm sorry, Tolkien."
[OTH],"Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad, Eric."
Cartman,"Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking? The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day. See ya later."
[OTH],"Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!"
Cartman,No way!
[OTH],"Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go-"
[OTH],Counselor Mackey?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with the FBI.
[OTH],We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident.
[OTH],"Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention."
[OTH],"I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor. You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered a hate crime."
Cartman,...What the hell is a hate crime?
[OTH],"Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-"
[OTH],"New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense."
Cartman,What? A federal offense?
[OTH],Oh no.
Cartman,Oh no??
[OTH],"We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol. Your son will be taken into custody and then tried in the federal court of law."
[OTH],Oh my goodness.
[OTH],"The hate crime trial of the century is underway on Court TV tracks U van. . Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith."
[OTH],"What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom as the defendant takes the stand."
[OTH],"Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of ""Tolkien?"""
Cartman,"Uh, yes?"
[OTH],Who is Tolkien?
Cartman,He's a black kid that goes to my school?
[OTH],Black?! Did you say black?! You called him black?!
Cartman,He is black.
[OTH],"O! He said it again! He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!"
Cartman,I did?
[OTH],The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!
Cartman,No! I hate hippies!
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!"
[OTH],"Oo, poopiekins?"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This ""monster"" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!"
Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!"
[OTH],The prosecution rests.
[OTH],"Don't forget: we still have that sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters."
[OTH],We know!
[OTH],"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice."
[OTH],"Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one."
Cartman,No!
[OTH],"I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are! Court is adjourned!"
[OTH],Woohoo! Hooray!
[OTH],"Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall."
[OTH],"Yes, sir."
[OTH],"Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go?"
Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!"
[OTH],(What the fuck for?!)
Cartman,They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
[OTH],(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
Cartman,"Calm down, Kenny!"
[OTH],(Hey!)
Cartman,Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
[OTH],(Yes.)
Cartman,"Well, come on! I don't have much time!"
[OTH],A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?
[OTH],"Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway. Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about."
Cartman,"Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!"
[OTH],(Why don'tcha keep your head down?!)
[OTH],"Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading. This could be the final stand-off."
[OTH],"Alright, that's far enough. Stop the Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with your hands up. Just bring it to a stop and come on out. Jeezus, he's gonna ram it! Crazy son of a bitch."
[OTH],"Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended."
[OTH],What the hell are they doing?
[OTH],The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
[OTH],"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?"
[OTH],"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon."
Cartman,"We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico! Oh, God dammit!"
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!"
[OTH],Son of a bitch!
[OTH],"Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall."
[OTH],"Prisoner 24601, arriving. Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500. Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband. At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper!"
Cartman,Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
[OTH],I am! And I don't want no new cellmate!
[OTH],"You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!"
[OTH],"Oh, I will! You bet your ass I will."
[OTH],"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday."
[OTH],"Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman."
[OTH],"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?"
[OTH],"...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde."
[OTH],I'm not fat.
[OTH],"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid."
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!"
[OTH],"Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned."
[OTH],"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go!"
[OTH],"Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move."
[OTH],"See you Saturday, poo sniffers!"
[OTH],"Nice going, fat boy!"
[OTH],"Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!"
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
[OTH],"Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!"
Cartman,"Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?"
[OTH],...Neither do we
Cartman,"Oh, thank you, Jesus. So we're friends now?"
[OTH],"No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in ""friends."""
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck."
[OTH],"Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here."
[OTH],"Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!"
[OTH],"Oh, that's a wonderful idea."
[OTH],So I don't get to be on the team now?
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass!"
[OTH],"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?!"
[OTH],"Come on, let's get it a try."
[OTH],Woopee!
[OTH],Yeah-
[OTH],Wo-o-o-o-oh!
[OTH],"Dude, bail! Bail!"
[OTH],(Huh? Uh.) (AAAAAA!) (Ufff!) (Ugh!)
[OTH],"Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny."
[OTH],We killed Kenny?
[OTH],We Killed Kenny. We're bastards.
[OTH],"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?"
[OTH],Nothing else is gonna work. We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
[OTH],"Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!"
[OTH],This is a sad day for men everywhere.
[OTH],"You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted."
[OTH],Yeup.
[OTH],If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
[OTH],"Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was."
[OTH],"Woohoo. Great time, girls. Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers!"
[OTH],That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
[OTH],Oh?
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],How?
[OTH],I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
[OTH],Sweet! Let's go!
[OTH],Hooray! Alright! Here we go!
[OTH],And have you been brushing your teeth?
[OTH],"Yes, Mommy."
[OTH],And not dropping your soap?
[OTH],"Yes, Mommy."
[OTH],"Hi, Mom."
[OTH],"Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded."
[OTH],"Grounded? Oh, no! Um, wait..."
[OTH],"Here you go, boys. Keep it short."
Cartman,Hey you guys.
[OTH],"Hey, fatass. How's prison?"
Cartman,"Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?"
[OTH],"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!"
[OTH],Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. So we made you this cake. There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
Cartman,A what?
[OTH],An ailnay ilefay.
Cartman,Wwhat's that?
[OTH],"Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!"
[OTH],"Yeah, you stupid umbassday!"
Cartman,"I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here"
[OTH],"They on'tday?! Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!"
[OTH],...Yeah.
Cartman,"Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?"
[OTH],"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-"
Cartman,Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
[OTH],Sshh!
Cartman,"Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, then I need those cigarettes."
[OTH],How are we supposed to give them to you?
Cartman,Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
[OTH],But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
Cartman,"I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass. Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!"
[OTH],"Alright, here."
Cartman,"Well, okay... here... l'see..."
[OTH],Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
[OTH],Me too.
Cartman,"Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now."
[OTH],Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals.
Cartman,"Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah."
[OTH],That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file.
[OTH],So now what do we do?
[OTH],"There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!"
[OTH],"Well, did you get the cigarettes?"
Cartman,Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
[OTH],Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards.
Cartman,"Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. There's one. There's two. Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh yeahhh. Hoh. Phew. Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit!"
[OTH],You flushed them?!
Cartman,"Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here."
[OTH],"No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me."
Cartman,Son of a bitch!
[OTH],"Dude, I didn't know Tolkien lived so far away."
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity."
[OTH],Yeah. But isn't Tolkien the only one?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],Hi. Can Token come out and play?
[OTH],"Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like."
[OTH],Killer.
[OTH],"Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well then, you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys."
[OTH],It's not?
[OTH],"No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor."
[OTH],"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit! Oh, sorry."
[OTH],"No, I'd, actually agree with you."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind."
[OTH],"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?"
[OTH],"Oh, he wouldn't listen to me."
[OTH],Why not?
[OTH],Because I'm black.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws."
Cartman,"Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh. Here you go, God-damnit!"
[OTH],"Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. Ew, it smells, man."
Cartman,"Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!"
[OTH],"You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!"
Cartman,But you said-
[OTH],I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
Cartman,I thought that-
[OTH],"Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house. Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess. Hey. Uh, what are you doing? You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!"
Cartman,I want my Mo-omm
[OTH],Dude.
Cartman,"Mommy, I want my Mommy!"
[OTH],"Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here."
Cartman,You will?
[OTH],"Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland."
[OTH],"Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?"
[OTH],"Naw, not another committee. Send them in. This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, boys, what can I do for you?"
[OTH],"Okay, go ahead and start."
[OTH],"I don't start, you start."
[OTH],"Oh, uhyeah. Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."" Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws."
[OTH],"If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime."
[OTH],"And we think that that is a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?"
[OTH],"If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?"
[OTH],And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
[OTH],"Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same."
[OTH],"But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday."
[OTH],That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
[OTH],"""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."""
[OTH],Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.
[OTH],Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us! Mph. Oowww!
Cartman,What's the matter?
[OTH],It's my leg! I think it's broken. You go on ahead without me.
Cartman,Uhokay.
[OTH],"Hey. You're supposed to say, ""I'm not going without you,"" or something."
Cartman,Oh. Really?
[OTH],"Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends."
Cartman,Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
[OTH],I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these.
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"No! You're supposed to say, ""I can't take these,"" or something, dumbass!"
Cartman,Oh. I can't take these.
[OTH],Take them. They'll bring you luck. Now go on. Get out of here.
Cartman,Romper?
[OTH],Yeah?
Cartman,"You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me."
[OTH],"Alright, freeze!"
Cartman,"You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!"
[OTH],But you've been pardoned by the governor!
Cartman,"O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes."
[OTH],"Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!"
[OTH],Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
[OTH],He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
[OTH],"Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!"
[OTH],"Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!"
[OTH],"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him."
[OTH],"Alright, where's Clyde."
[OTH],Right here.
[OTH],"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!"
[OTH],"For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit!"
[OTH],"On the sled, fatass!"
[OTH],"Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-"
Cartman,You guys!
[OTH],It's Cartman!
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,That's right! I'm back!
[OTH],"Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back! Thank you so much. Thank you."
Cartman,What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
[OTH],This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
[OTH],All right! Let's do this!
[OTH],Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
Cartman,I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
[OTH],Uh-get set. Go!
Cartman,"Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside."
[OTH],"Go, fatass!"
Cartman,"When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-"
[OTH],"Go, fatass!"
[OTH],Come on! We've gotta catch up to them!
[OTH],"We've got' em, girls!"
[OTH],Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
[OTH],Go! You can do it! Come on!
[OTH],We're not gonna make it!
Cartman,Hey.
[OTH],G'aaaaah!
[OTH],Rowr. {carries Lizzy away]
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],We did it!
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],We won! We won!
[OTH],"Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"It's good to have you back, Cartman."
[OTH],"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again."
Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again."
[OTH],"Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass! Oh-ff."
Cartman,Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
[OTH],Naah.
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up! You got a visitor!
[OTH],Eric!
Cartman,"Hey, Romper Stomper."
[OTH],Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
Cartman,"Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too."
[OTH],You did?
Cartman,You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh. Ogh! Wait-
[OTH],"Oh, yeah!"
Cartman,"Uh, what else? Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh!"
[OTH],"Oh, the monorail!"
[OTH],Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
[OTH],Ready!
[OTH],On your marks! Get set! Uh-go!
[OTH],We win again!
[OTH],That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat, Tolkien!"
[OTH],"We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!"
[OTH],Sleds are for guys.
Cartman,Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
[OTH],"These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!"
[OTH],"Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!"
[OTH],Oh yeah?!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
[OTH],"How about a race down a real hill, then?!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],You got it!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
[OTH],No problem!
[OTH],Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
[OTH],Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
[OTH],"See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!"
[OTH],"Oh, boy! We'll show them!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are."
[OTH],"Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!"
Cartman,"Tolkien, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock!"
[OTH],Fatass.
Cartman,There!
[OTH],Oh!
Cartman,Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
[OTH],"And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?"
[OTH],"Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?"
Cartman,"I'm sorry, Mom."
[OTH],"Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!"
Cartman,"I'm sorry, Tolkien."
[OTH],"Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad, Eric."
Cartman,"Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking? The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day. See ya later."
[OTH],"Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!"
Cartman,No way!
[OTH],"Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go-"
[OTH],Counselor Mackey?
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with the FBI.
[OTH],We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident.
[OTH],"Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention."
[OTH],"I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor. You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered a hate crime."
Cartman,...What the hell is a hate crime?
[OTH],"Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-"
[OTH],"New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense."
Cartman,What? A federal offense?
[OTH],Oh no.
Cartman,Oh no??
[OTH],"We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol. Your son will be taken into custody and then tried in the federal court of law."
[OTH],Oh my goodness.
[OTH],"The hate crime trial of the century is underway on Court TV tracks U van. . Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith."
[OTH],"What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom as the defendant takes the stand."
[OTH],"Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of ""Tolkien?"""
Cartman,"Uh, yes?"
[OTH],Who is Tolkien?
Cartman,He's a black kid that goes to my school?
[OTH],Black?! Did you say black?! You called him black?!
Cartman,He is black.
[OTH],"O! He said it again! He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!"
Cartman,I did?
[OTH],The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!
Cartman,No! I hate hippies!
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!"
[OTH],"Oo, poopiekins?"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This ""monster"" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!"
Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!"
[OTH],The prosecution rests.
[OTH],"Don't forget: we still have that sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters."
[OTH],We know!
[OTH],"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice."
[OTH],"Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one."
Cartman,No!
[OTH],"I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are! Court is adjourned!"
[OTH],Woohoo! Hooray!
[OTH],"Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall."
[OTH],"Yes, sir."
[OTH],"Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go?"
Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!"
[OTH],(What the fuck for?!)
Cartman,They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
[OTH],(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
Cartman,"Calm down, Kenny!"
[OTH],(Hey!)
Cartman,Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
[OTH],(Yes.)
Cartman,"Well, come on! I don't have much time!"
[OTH],A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?
[OTH],"Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway. Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about."
Cartman,"Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!"
[OTH],(Why don'tcha keep your head down?!)
[OTH],"Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading. This could be the final stand-off."
[OTH],"Alright, that's far enough. Stop the Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with your hands up. Just bring it to a stop and come on out. Jeezus, he's gonna ram it! Crazy son of a bitch."
[OTH],"Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended."
[OTH],What the hell are they doing?
[OTH],The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
[OTH],"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?"
[OTH],"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon."
Cartman,"We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico! Oh, God dammit!"
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!"
[OTH],Son of a bitch!
[OTH],"Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall."
[OTH],"Prisoner 24601, arriving. Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500. Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband. At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper!"
Cartman,Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
[OTH],I am! And I don't want no new cellmate!
[OTH],"You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!"
[OTH],"Oh, I will! You bet your ass I will."
[OTH],"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday."
[OTH],"Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman."
[OTH],"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?"
[OTH],"...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde."
[OTH],I'm not fat.
[OTH],"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid."
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!"
[OTH],"Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned."
[OTH],"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go!"
[OTH],"Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move."
[OTH],"See you Saturday, poo sniffers!"
[OTH],"Nice going, fat boy!"
[OTH],"Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!"
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
[OTH],"Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!"
Cartman,"Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?"
[OTH],...Neither do we
Cartman,"Oh, thank you, Jesus. So we're friends now?"
[OTH],"No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in ""friends."""
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck."
[OTH],"Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here."
[OTH],"Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!"
[OTH],"Oh, that's a wonderful idea."
[OTH],So I don't get to be on the team now?
[OTH],"Shut up, fatass!"
[OTH],"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?!"
[OTH],"Come on, let's get it a try."
[OTH],Woopee!
[OTH],Yeah-
[OTH],Wo-o-o-o-oh!
[OTH],"Dude, bail! Bail!"
[OTH],(Huh? Uh.) (AAAAAA!) (Ufff!) (Ugh!)
[OTH],"Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny."
[OTH],We killed Kenny?
[OTH],We Killed Kenny. We're bastards.
[OTH],"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?"
[OTH],Nothing else is gonna work. We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
[OTH],"Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!"
[OTH],This is a sad day for men everywhere.
[OTH],"You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted."
[OTH],Yeup.
[OTH],If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
[OTH],"Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was."
[OTH],"Woohoo. Great time, girls. Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers!"
[OTH],That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
[OTH],Oh?
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],How?
[OTH],I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
[OTH],Sweet! Let's go!
[OTH],Hooray! Alright! Here we go!
[OTH],And have you been brushing your teeth?
[OTH],"Yes, Mommy."
[OTH],And not dropping your soap?
[OTH],"Yes, Mommy."
[OTH],"Hi, Mom."
[OTH],"Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded."
[OTH],"Grounded? Oh, no! Um, wait..."
[OTH],"Here you go, boys. Keep it short."
Cartman,Hey you guys.
[OTH],"Hey, fatass. How's prison?"
Cartman,"Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?"
[OTH],"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!"
[OTH],Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. So we made you this cake. There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
Cartman,A what?
[OTH],An ailnay ilefay.
Cartman,Wwhat's that?
[OTH],"Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!"
[OTH],"Yeah, you stupid umbassday!"
Cartman,"I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here"
[OTH],"They on'tday?! Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!"
[OTH],...Yeah.
Cartman,"Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?"
[OTH],"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-"
Cartman,Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
[OTH],Sshh!
Cartman,"Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, then I need those cigarettes."
[OTH],How are we supposed to give them to you?
Cartman,Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
[OTH],But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
Cartman,"I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass. Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!"
[OTH],"Alright, here."
Cartman,"Well, okay... here... l'see..."
[OTH],Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
[OTH],Me too.
Cartman,"Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now."
[OTH],Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals.
Cartman,"Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah."
[OTH],That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file.
[OTH],So now what do we do?
[OTH],"There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!"
[OTH],"Well, did you get the cigarettes?"
Cartman,Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
[OTH],Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards.
Cartman,"Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. There's one. There's two. Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh yeahhh. Hoh. Phew. Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit!"
[OTH],You flushed them?!
Cartman,"Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here."
[OTH],"No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me."
Cartman,Son of a bitch!
[OTH],"Dude, I didn't know Tolkien lived so far away."
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity."
[OTH],Yeah. But isn't Tolkien the only one?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],Hi. Can Token come out and play?
[OTH],"Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like."
[OTH],Killer.
[OTH],"Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well then, you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys."
[OTH],It's not?
[OTH],"No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor."
[OTH],"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit! Oh, sorry."
[OTH],"No, I'd, actually agree with you."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind."
[OTH],"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?"
[OTH],"Oh, he wouldn't listen to me."
[OTH],Why not?
[OTH],Because I'm black.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws."
Cartman,"Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh. Here you go, God-damnit!"
[OTH],"Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. Ew, it smells, man."
Cartman,"Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!"
[OTH],"You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!"
Cartman,But you said-
[OTH],I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
Cartman,I thought that-
[OTH],"Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house. Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess. Hey. Uh, what are you doing? You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!"
Cartman,I want my Mo-omm
[OTH],Dude.
Cartman,"Mommy, I want my Mommy!"
[OTH],"Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here."
Cartman,You will?
[OTH],"Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland."
[OTH],"Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?"
[OTH],"Naw, not another committee. Send them in. This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, boys, what can I do for you?"
[OTH],"Okay, go ahead and start."
[OTH],"I don't start, you start."
[OTH],"Oh, uhyeah. Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."" Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws."
[OTH],"If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime."
[OTH],"And we think that that is a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?"
[OTH],"If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?"
[OTH],And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
[OTH],"Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same."
[OTH],"But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday."
[OTH],That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
[OTH],"""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."""
[OTH],Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.
[OTH],Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us! Mph. Oowww!
Cartman,What's the matter?
[OTH],It's my leg! I think it's broken. You go on ahead without me.
Cartman,Uhokay.
[OTH],"Hey. You're supposed to say, ""I'm not going without you,"" or something."
Cartman,Oh. Really?
[OTH],"Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends."
Cartman,Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
[OTH],I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these.
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],"No! You're supposed to say, ""I can't take these,"" or something, dumbass!"
Cartman,Oh. I can't take these.
[OTH],Take them. They'll bring you luck. Now go on. Get out of here.
Cartman,Romper?
[OTH],Yeah?
Cartman,"You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me."
[OTH],"Alright, freeze!"
Cartman,"You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!"
[OTH],But you've been pardoned by the governor!
Cartman,"O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes."
[OTH],"Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!"
[OTH],Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
[OTH],He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
[OTH],"Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!"
[OTH],"Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!"
[OTH],"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him."
[OTH],"Alright, where's Clyde."
[OTH],Right here.
[OTH],"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!"
[OTH],"For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit!"
[OTH],"On the sled, fatass!"
[OTH],"Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-"
Cartman,You guys!
[OTH],It's Cartman!
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,That's right! I'm back!
[OTH],"Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back! Thank you so much. Thank you."
Cartman,What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
[OTH],This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
[OTH],All right! Let's do this!
[OTH],Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
Cartman,I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
[OTH],Uh-get set. Go!
Cartman,"Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside."
[OTH],"Go, fatass!"
Cartman,"When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-"
[OTH],"Go, fatass!"
[OTH],Come on! We've gotta catch up to them!
[OTH],"We've got' em, girls!"
[OTH],Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
[OTH],Go! You can do it! Come on!
[OTH],We're not gonna make it!
Cartman,Hey.
[OTH],G'aaaaah!
[OTH],Rowr. {carries Lizzy away]
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],We did it!
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],We won! We won!
[OTH],"Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"It's good to have you back, Cartman."
[OTH],"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again."
Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again."
[OTH],"Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass! Oh-ff."
Cartman,Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
[OTH],Naah.
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up! You got a visitor!
[OTH],Eric!
Cartman,"Hey, Romper Stomper."
[OTH],Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
Cartman,"Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too."
[OTH],You did?
Cartman,You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh. Ogh! Wait-
[OTH],"Oh, yeah!"
Cartman,"Uh, what else? Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh!"
[OTH],"Oh, the monorail!"
[OTH],"Dude, did you do all your homework last night?"
[OTH],Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
[OTH],I know!
[OTH],"Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together? Let's see, how about..."
Cartman,"Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me."
[OTH],Wendy?
Cartman,Phew!
[OTH],1776.
[OTH],"Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?"
Cartman,"Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-"
[OTH],Kyle?
Cartman,"Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!"
[OTH],The Declaration of Independence?
[OTH],"Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence? Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy?"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again."
[OTH],Heh-aaaaaah!
[OTH],"Timmy, did you not do your homework?!"
[OTH],Erh Timmiihh!!
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded."
[OTH],"Don't call people names, Stanley!"
[OTH],But he is-
[OTH],"Now, Timmy,—"
[OTH],Haaaaah.
[OTH],—You need to work on your study skills!
[OTH],Doo-uhh.
[OTH],"Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!"
[OTH],"G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!"
[OTH],THAT DOES IT!
[OTH],"Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention."
[OTH],Heh-aaaaaah!
[OTH],"Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders!"
[OTH],Ehhha-a-a-ah.
[OTH],"Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria. I think I may know what the problem is."
[OTH],Timmiihh.
[OTH],"Yes, of course."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, ""Attention Deficit Disorder,"" or ADD. It's very common in kids his age."
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"Well, that certainly would explain it."
[OTH],"It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Oolih oo livin' a lie, Timmehuh!"
[OTH],"Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder."
[OTH],Good.
[OTH],M'kay.
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, ""The Great Gatsby,"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?"
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Okay, here we go. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since"" ""so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
[OTH],Ha-a-a-a-a-h.
[OTH],"Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?"
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"Well, that settles it!"
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!
[OTH],"Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it."
[OTH],"What can we do for him, doctor?"
[OTH],"Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy."
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Hurry up, children, let's take our seats. You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy. What's this?"
[OTH],Tim-mih.
[OTH],"A note from the principal? ""Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder."" Oh, brother!"
[OTH],He doesn't have to do homework?
[OTH],"That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!"
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Very well, I guess you're excused from homework."
[OTH],Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
Cartman,"Yeah, me too."
[OTH],I've got ADD.
[OTH],(Me too.)
[OTH],"Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah."
[OTH],It's gay.
[OTH],"""After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain."" Alright now, in Chapter 12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van Campen talk about? Anybody? Anybody?? My God, these children all have ADD!"
[OTH],Hooray.
Cartman,Hoo-ray.
[OTH],It's Ritalin for all of you!
[OTH],"Dude, we suck!"
[OTH],"Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!"
[OTH],"Dude, we never win the Battle of the Bands! It's no big deal."
[OTH],"Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!"
[OTH],"Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting."
[OTH],We've just gotta practice more.
[OTH],"Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler."
[OTH],"Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top!"
[OTH],Timmuuhh! Coodalah Timmuh!
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],"Huh-I don't know, man. Whoaaa!"
[OTH],Who is that?
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"You a singer, man?"
[OTH],Rrrrr-laurlaurlah Timmehah! Timmehuh! Timmehh.
[OTH],"Dude, that's hot!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin."
[OTH],And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?
[OTH],We can only hope so. Next?
[OTH],"Oh, hi, Sheila."
[OTH],"Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?"
[OTH],Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
[OTH],"I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old."
[OTH],...I am eight.
[OTH],"Next, please? What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin!"
[OTH],Yes.
Cartman,That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
[OTH],"Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?"
[OTH],"Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all."
[OTH],Alright.
[OTH],"Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected."
[OTH],Oh my.
[OTH],"Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light). Lettin' it feel so light."
[OTH],Boooo!
[OTH],You suck!
[OTH],"Alright, that was ""Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord,"" with their song, ""Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)"""
[OTH],We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.
[OTH],And now it's time for our final band.
[OTH],Thank God!
[OTH],"Give it up for ""Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld!"""
[OTH],1 2 3 4
[OTH],Timmih! Timmih! Lehmeheuh! Timmih!
[OTH],"Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules!"
[OTH],Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!
[OTH],You guys are terrible! How could you laugh at that poor kid?!
[OTH],Timmih Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!
[OTH],Lords of the Underworld.
[OTH],"Timmih, Timmiih!"
[OTH],Darkness fills my heart with pain.
[OTH],Timmih oo livin' a lie!
[OTH],"Dude, it's Timmy."
[OTH],No way!
[OTH],"They're ridiculing that singer! Come on, let's get outta here!"
[OTH],Sibilah Sibinlaahh!
[OTH],The Lords of the Underworld.
[OTH],"Timmih, Timmih Timmitimmi Timmiih!"
[OTH],Darkness fills my heart with pain.
[OTH],Timmehahh! Timmeh Timmeh Sibinlah Timmih Sibinlah Timmih. Timmuh Timmuh Timmuh. Timmeh!
Cartman,That was awesuhome!
[OTH],"Yeah, Timmy ruhules!"
[OTH],Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
[OTH],But he's funny.
[OTH],How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!
[OTH],Hehaahh!
[OTH],He looks pretty happy to me.
[OTH],"Oh, you people make me sick!"
[OTH],"Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY!"
[OTH],Wooo!
[OTH],"We did it, dude!"
[OTH],Listen to them. They really love me. Wooo!!
[OTH],Wooo!!
[OTH],Yes! I'm a rocker!
[OTH],"Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation, Timmeo , the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm. Already playing at several large venues this month , the band prepares for its biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they will open for Phil Collins. But Phil Collins is not happy."
[OTH],"Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna see Timmy for his musical skills. They're laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities!"
[OTH],Hah haha.
[OTH],Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!
[OTH],"Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?"
[OTH],"Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is."
Cartman,"Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?"
[OTH],"Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff."
Cartman,"No, dude, you gotta try it. It makes you feel good."
[OTH],(Good.)
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
Cartman,"Hello, Chef."
[OTH],"(Hello, Chef.)"
[OTH],How's it goin'?
Cartman,"Very well, thank you."
[OTH],"(Very well, thank you.)"
[OTH],Everything's fine?? Why??
[OTH],Because we're on Ritalin.
[OTH],What??
[OTH],We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
Cartman,"It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it."
[OTH],So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
[OTH],"That's correct, Chef."
[OTH],"Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!"
[OTH],"Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium"
[OTH],Oh boy oh boy.
[OTH],(Oh boy.)
[OTH],"Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects."
[OTH],"But there are no side effects, Chef."
[OTH],"No, not at all."
[OTH],Rown!
Cartman,Did you guys see that?
[OTH],See what?
[OTH],"You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing, twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image. We're so cool that we decide what's cool. And now, MTV News, the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country. Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt Loder."
[OTH],Why am I still doing this? I've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years.
[OTH],"Kurt Loder didn't just say that. No way, he did just say it, but just to be cool. That's what makes him cool. You think Kurt Loder is cool. And now, the news that's cool."
[OTH],"Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy , the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins."
[OTH],"Well, I think the sad question is, ""Where are the parents in all this?"" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care."
[OTH],"And so, Phil Collins decided to travel to South Park and personally pay Timmy's parents a visit."
[OTH],"Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him?"
[OTH],Richarrrrd!
[OTH],Helennnn!
[OTH],'Oodleahah.
[OTH],"Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news."
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's settle down! Huhh I mean it; I want quiet! My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin. Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?! Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex. Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!"
Cartman,"What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
[OTH],"Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin?"
Cartman,There you go.
[OTH],Rowr.
Cartman,Whah!
[OTH],"Thank you, Baltimore! Good night!"
[OTH],"Alright, let's rock this house! Hello Miami!"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"Excuse me, Skyler Morse?"
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins.
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla."
[OTH],"I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer."
[OTH],"Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run."
[OTH],It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is ""Timmy,"""
[OTH],"Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld."
[OTH],"Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow."
[OTH],"Uh, thanks man. See ya."
[OTH],That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense.
[OTH],Timmuh!
[OTH],"Another great show, man. There must have been a hundred thousand people out there."
[OTH],"Yeah. All of them chanting ""Timmy, Timmy."""
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"What's the matter, Skyler?"
[OTH],"The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy."
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],And the Lords of the Underworld!
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!"
[OTH],"Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous."
[OTH],"Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on! I don't need Timmy! I'm goin' solo!"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"No! Don't try and stop me, man! I'll see you on fame's backside."
[OTH],Ooo livin' a lie!
[OTH],"Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?"
[OTH],Let me see.
[OTH],"How do you like that, Terrance?"
[OTH],Let's watch something else.
[OTH],"Yes, let's."
[OTH],You're watching VH1.
[OTH],Ahhhh.
[OTH],Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up.
[OTH],Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
[OTH],"And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler."
[OTH],You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
[OTH],"Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter."
Cartman,"I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins."
[OTH],Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
[OTH],Sounds good.
Cartman,"So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us. Hooray. Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny."
[OTH],"Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny."
[OTH],Bastard.
[OTH],"Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin."
[OTH],"Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it."
[OTH],"I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape."
[OTH],"Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder. This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child."
[OTH],"I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara- Ah!"
[OTH],Sit down and study!
[OTH],"Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go!"
[OTH],Sit down and study!
[OTH],Wwaaahahahahaaha
[OTH],"Stop crying and do your schoolwork! If you would like more information on my bold new treatments, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, ""You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again."" Thank you."
[OTH],"Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee."
[OTH],That video had pretty colors.
[OTH],It sure did.
[OTH],What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Awww, fudge it!"
[OTH],"Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?"
[OTH],The what?
[OTH],"Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us."
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
[OTH],Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
[OTH],Oh my God!!
[OTH],"Come, see him with us."
Cartman,"Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again! She's on my back! Hah!"
[OTH],That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
[OTH],Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.
[OTH],That's easily another twenty grand apiece!
[OTH],"Hey, open this damn door."
[OTH],Can I help you?
[OTH],Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
[OTH],"Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-"
[OTH],I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!"
[OTH],"Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-"
[OTH],"You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!"
[OTH],"Eh wuh, what??"
[OTH],That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
[OTH],Mm- my God. What have we done??
[OTH],"Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God!"
[OTH],"Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!"
[OTH],"We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them."
[OTH],Then we need an antidote!
[OTH],"Yes, of course."
[OTH],"Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?"
[OTH],"I have some right here. It's a compound called ""Ritalout."""
[OTH],"Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick!"
[OTH],"Last night I went, ""O!""BubudioLast night I went ""Bubudio"""
[OTH],Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children.
[OTH],"Last night I went, ""O!"" Bububudio."
[OTH],"Wasn't that great, son?"
[OTH],"Sure was, Dad."
[OTH],It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
[OTH],"Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me."
[OTH],"Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice."
[OTH],"I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitled, 
""You'll Be In... Me."" Thanks. You're inside of me. Deep inside of me. So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart."
[OTH],"Come on, drink it down. It's free."
Cartman,You'll be inside of me...
[OTH],Rowr.
Cartman,Huh? Oh no! Agh! Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
[OTH],I feel... different.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh"
[OTH],"Drink this, Eric. God help me! Heh, get it... She's gone! Thank God!"
[OTH],"Well, thanks!"
[OTH],Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
[OTH],Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
[OTH],I think it's working.
[OTH],Booooo!!
[OTH],"Shut your filthy holes, you little bastards!"
[OTH],"Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],You just wanna laugh at him.
[OTH],"No! You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!"
[OTH],Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
[OTH],Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!
[OTH],"Man, it sucks not being part of Lalapalabala."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Hey dudes.
[OTH],"Skyler, what are you doing here?! Isn't Reach for the Skyler supposed to play soon?"
[OTH],They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
[OTH],"Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again?"
[OTH],"I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head..."
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],Wow. They really are chanting for us.
[OTH],Hn they want us back.
[OTH],"What do you say, Timmy?"
[OTH],"Rrr, rrr, uh, Timmih."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the reunion tour of Timmehuh!"
[OTH],"Timmiihh, and the Lords of the Underworld! Timmiihh! Timmih! Livin' a lie-ah! Hidilah Timmy! Timmuh- Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!"
[OTH],And the Lords of the Underworld.
[OTH],"Put me down, you filthy bastards! Awwww!"
[OTH],Timmiihh uluh-livin' a lie!
[OTH],"Dude, did you do all your homework last night?"
[OTH],Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
[OTH],I know!
[OTH],"Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together? Let's see, how about..."
Cartman,"Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me."
[OTH],Wendy?
Cartman,Phew!
[OTH],1776.
[OTH],"Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?"
Cartman,"Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-"
[OTH],Kyle?
Cartman,"Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!"
[OTH],The Declaration of Independence?
[OTH],"Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence? Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy?"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again."
[OTH],Heh-aaaaaah!
[OTH],"Timmy, did you not do your homework?!"
[OTH],Erh Timmiihh!!
[OTH],"Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded."
[OTH],"Don't call people names, Stanley!"
[OTH],But he is-
[OTH],"Now, Timmy,—"
[OTH],Haaaaah.
[OTH],—You need to work on your study skills!
[OTH],Doo-uhh.
[OTH],"Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!"
[OTH],"G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!"
[OTH],THAT DOES IT!
[OTH],"Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention."
[OTH],Heh-aaaaaah!
[OTH],"Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders!"
[OTH],Ehhha-a-a-ah.
[OTH],"Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria. I think I may know what the problem is."
[OTH],Timmiihh.
[OTH],"Yes, of course."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, ""Attention Deficit Disorder,"" or ADD. It's very common in kids his age."
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"Well, that certainly would explain it."
[OTH],"It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?"
[OTH],"Oolih oo livin' a lie, Timmehuh!"
[OTH],"Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder."
[OTH],Good.
[OTH],M'kay.
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, ""The Great Gatsby,"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?"
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Okay, here we go. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since"" ""so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
[OTH],Ha-a-a-a-a-h.
[OTH],"Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?"
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"Well, that settles it!"
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!
[OTH],"Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it."
[OTH],"What can we do for him, doctor?"
[OTH],"Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy."
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Hurry up, children, let's take our seats. You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy. What's this?"
[OTH],Tim-mih.
[OTH],"A note from the principal? ""Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder."" Oh, brother!"
[OTH],He doesn't have to do homework?
[OTH],"That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!"
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Very well, I guess you're excused from homework."
[OTH],Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
Cartman,"Yeah, me too."
[OTH],I've got ADD.
[OTH],(Me too.)
[OTH],"Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah."
[OTH],It's gay.
[OTH],"""After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain."" Alright now, in Chapter 12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van Campen talk about? Anybody? Anybody?? My God, these children all have ADD!"
[OTH],Hooray.
Cartman,Hoo-ray.
[OTH],It's Ritalin for all of you!
[OTH],"Dude, we suck!"
[OTH],"Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!"
[OTH],"Dude, we never win the Battle of the Bands! It's no big deal."
[OTH],"Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!"
[OTH],"Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting."
[OTH],We've just gotta practice more.
[OTH],"Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler."
[OTH],"Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top!"
[OTH],Timmuuhh! Coodalah Timmuh!
[OTH],What was that?
[OTH],"Huh-I don't know, man. Whoaaa!"
[OTH],Who is that?
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"You a singer, man?"
[OTH],Rrrrr-laurlaurlah Timmehah! Timmehuh! Timmehh.
[OTH],"Dude, that's hot!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin."
[OTH],And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?
[OTH],We can only hope so. Next?
[OTH],"Oh, hi, Sheila."
[OTH],"Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?"
[OTH],Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
[OTH],"I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old."
[OTH],...I am eight.
[OTH],"Next, please? What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin!"
[OTH],Yes.
Cartman,That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
[OTH],"Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?"
[OTH],"Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all."
[OTH],Alright.
[OTH],"Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected."
[OTH],Oh my.
[OTH],"Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light). Lettin' it feel so light."
[OTH],Boooo!
[OTH],You suck!
[OTH],"Alright, that was ""Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord,"" with their song, ""Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)"""
[OTH],We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.
[OTH],And now it's time for our final band.
[OTH],Thank God!
[OTH],"Give it up for ""Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld!"""
[OTH],1 2 3 4
[OTH],Timmih! Timmih! Lehmeheuh! Timmih!
[OTH],"Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules!"
[OTH],Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!
[OTH],You guys are terrible! How could you laugh at that poor kid?!
[OTH],Timmih Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!
[OTH],Lords of the Underworld.
[OTH],"Timmih, Timmiih!"
[OTH],Darkness fills my heart with pain.
[OTH],Timmih oo livin' a lie!
[OTH],"Dude, it's Timmy."
[OTH],No way!
[OTH],"They're ridiculing that singer! Come on, let's get outta here!"
[OTH],Sibilah Sibinlaahh!
[OTH],The Lords of the Underworld.
[OTH],"Timmih, Timmih Timmitimmi Timmiih!"
[OTH],Darkness fills my heart with pain.
[OTH],Timmehahh! Timmeh Timmeh Sibinlah Timmih Sibinlah Timmih. Timmuh Timmuh Timmuh. Timmeh!
Cartman,That was awesuhome!
[OTH],"Yeah, Timmy ruhules!"
[OTH],Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
[OTH],But he's funny.
[OTH],How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!
[OTH],Hehaahh!
[OTH],He looks pretty happy to me.
[OTH],"Oh, you people make me sick!"
[OTH],"Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY!"
[OTH],Wooo!
[OTH],"We did it, dude!"
[OTH],Listen to them. They really love me. Wooo!!
[OTH],Wooo!!
[OTH],Yes! I'm a rocker!
[OTH],"Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation, Timmeo , the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm. Already playing at several large venues this month , the band prepares for its biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they will open for Phil Collins. But Phil Collins is not happy."
[OTH],"Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna see Timmy for his musical skills. They're laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities!"
[OTH],Hah haha.
[OTH],Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!
[OTH],"Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?"
[OTH],"Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is."
Cartman,"Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?"
[OTH],"Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff."
Cartman,"No, dude, you gotta try it. It makes you feel good."
[OTH],(Good.)
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
Cartman,"Hello, Chef."
[OTH],"(Hello, Chef.)"
[OTH],How's it goin'?
Cartman,"Very well, thank you."
[OTH],"(Very well, thank you.)"
[OTH],Everything's fine?? Why??
[OTH],Because we're on Ritalin.
[OTH],What??
[OTH],We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
Cartman,"It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it."
[OTH],So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
[OTH],"That's correct, Chef."
[OTH],"Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!"
[OTH],"Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium"
[OTH],Oh boy oh boy.
[OTH],(Oh boy.)
[OTH],"Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects."
[OTH],"But there are no side effects, Chef."
[OTH],"No, not at all."
[OTH],Rown!
Cartman,Did you guys see that?
[OTH],See what?
[OTH],"You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing, twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image. We're so cool that we decide what's cool. And now, MTV News, the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country. Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt Loder."
[OTH],Why am I still doing this? I've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years.
[OTH],"Kurt Loder didn't just say that. No way, he did just say it, but just to be cool. That's what makes him cool. You think Kurt Loder is cool. And now, the news that's cool."
[OTH],"Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy , the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins."
[OTH],"Well, I think the sad question is, ""Where are the parents in all this?"" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care."
[OTH],"And so, Phil Collins decided to travel to South Park and personally pay Timmy's parents a visit."
[OTH],"Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him?"
[OTH],Richarrrrd!
[OTH],Helennnn!
[OTH],'Oodleahah.
[OTH],"Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news."
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's settle down! Huhh I mean it; I want quiet! My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin. Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?! Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex. Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!"
Cartman,"What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
[OTH],"Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin?"
Cartman,There you go.
[OTH],Rowr.
Cartman,Whah!
[OTH],"Thank you, Baltimore! Good night!"
[OTH],"Alright, let's rock this house! Hello Miami!"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"Excuse me, Skyler Morse?"
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins.
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla."
[OTH],"I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer."
[OTH],"Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run."
[OTH],It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is ""Timmy,"""
[OTH],"Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld."
[OTH],"Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow."
[OTH],"Uh, thanks man. See ya."
[OTH],That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense.
[OTH],Timmuh!
[OTH],"Another great show, man. There must have been a hundred thousand people out there."
[OTH],"Yeah. All of them chanting ""Timmy, Timmy."""
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"What's the matter, Skyler?"
[OTH],"The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy."
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],And the Lords of the Underworld!
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!"
[OTH],"Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous."
[OTH],"Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on! I don't need Timmy! I'm goin' solo!"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],"No! Don't try and stop me, man! I'll see you on fame's backside."
[OTH],Ooo livin' a lie!
[OTH],"Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?"
[OTH],Let me see.
[OTH],"How do you like that, Terrance?"
[OTH],Let's watch something else.
[OTH],"Yes, let's."
[OTH],You're watching VH1.
[OTH],Ahhhh.
[OTH],Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up.
[OTH],Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
[OTH],"And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler."
[OTH],You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
[OTH],"Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter."
Cartman,"I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins."
[OTH],Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
[OTH],Sounds good.
Cartman,"So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us. Hooray. Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny."
[OTH],"Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny."
[OTH],Bastard.
[OTH],"Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin."
[OTH],"Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it."
[OTH],"I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape."
[OTH],"Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder. This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child."
[OTH],"I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara- Ah!"
[OTH],Sit down and study!
[OTH],"Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go!"
[OTH],Sit down and study!
[OTH],Wwaaahahahahaaha
[OTH],"Stop crying and do your schoolwork! If you would like more information on my bold new treatments, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, ""You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again."" Thank you."
[OTH],"Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee."
[OTH],That video had pretty colors.
[OTH],It sure did.
[OTH],What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Awww, fudge it!"
[OTH],"Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?"
[OTH],The what?
[OTH],"Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us."
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
[OTH],Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
[OTH],Oh my God!!
[OTH],"Come, see him with us."
Cartman,"Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again! She's on my back! Hah!"
[OTH],That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
[OTH],Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.
[OTH],That's easily another twenty grand apiece!
[OTH],"Hey, open this damn door."
[OTH],Can I help you?
[OTH],Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
[OTH],"Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-"
[OTH],I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!"
[OTH],"Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-"
[OTH],"You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!"
[OTH],"Eh wuh, what??"
[OTH],That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
[OTH],Mm- my God. What have we done??
[OTH],"Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God!"
[OTH],"Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!"
[OTH],"We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them."
[OTH],Then we need an antidote!
[OTH],"Yes, of course."
[OTH],"Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?"
[OTH],"I have some right here. It's a compound called ""Ritalout."""
[OTH],"Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick!"
[OTH],"Last night I went, ""O!""BubudioLast night I went ""Bubudio"""
[OTH],Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children.
[OTH],"Last night I went, ""O!"" Bububudio."
[OTH],"Wasn't that great, son?"
[OTH],"Sure was, Dad."
[OTH],It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
[OTH],"Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me."
[OTH],"Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice."
[OTH],"I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitled, 
""You'll Be In... Me."" Thanks. You're inside of me. Deep inside of me. So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart."
[OTH],"Come on, drink it down. It's free."
Cartman,You'll be inside of me...
[OTH],Rowr.
Cartman,Huh? Oh no! Agh! Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
[OTH],I feel... different.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh"
[OTH],"Drink this, Eric. God help me! Heh, get it... She's gone! Thank God!"
[OTH],"Well, thanks!"
[OTH],Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
[OTH],Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
[OTH],I think it's working.
[OTH],Booooo!!
[OTH],"Shut your filthy holes, you little bastards!"
[OTH],"Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],You just wanna laugh at him.
[OTH],"No! You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!"
[OTH],Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
[OTH],Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!
[OTH],"Man, it sucks not being part of Lalapalabala."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Hey dudes.
[OTH],"Skyler, what are you doing here?! Isn't Reach for the Skyler supposed to play soon?"
[OTH],They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
[OTH],"Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again?"
[OTH],"I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head..."
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],Wow. They really are chanting for us.
[OTH],Hn they want us back.
[OTH],"What do you say, Timmy?"
[OTH],"Rrr, rrr, uh, Timmih."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the reunion tour of Timmehuh!"
[OTH],"Timmiihh, and the Lords of the Underworld! Timmiihh! Timmih! Livin' a lie-ah! Hidilah Timmy! Timmuh- Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!"
[OTH],And the Lords of the Underworld.
[OTH],"Put me down, you filthy bastards! Awwww!"
[OTH],Timmiihh uluh-livin' a lie!
[OTH],"Okay, is everyone ready to go?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville."
[OTH],"Me too. We were lucky to get tickets. Come on, boys! We're gonna be late."
[OTH],"Oh, don't they look precious?"
[OTH],"Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns"
[OTH],"No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things.."
[OTH],Awwww!
[OTH],Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!
[OTH],"Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!"
[OTH],"Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each other's faces!"
[OTH],"Come on, everybody, let's go."
[OTH],"Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man."
[OTH],"Oh, this is so exciting"
[OTH],"Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley."
[OTH],"Where? Oh, no. Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye. No, thank you. Go away, please."
Cartman,"He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it! Ow."
[OTH],"You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley?"
Cartman,"Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts from bursting out of my sides!"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during Sarque du Son Bleu."
Cartman,"Sarque du Son Bleu. Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain."
[OTH],"Eric, sshhhh."
[OTH],How long does this thing last?
[OTH],Two hours.
Cartman,Awwwgh.
[OTH],"Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania."
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
Cartman,Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers?
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],"Damn, dude."
Cartman,Yayy!
[OTH],(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Oh, that was wonderful!"
[OTH],"Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again."
[OTH],Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
Cartman,"Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!"
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!"
Cartman,Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on!
[OTH],"Don't forget to buy your souvenirs, folks."
[OTH],"Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?"
Cartman,"Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash."
[OTH],"Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over."
[OTH],Let's go practice.
[OTH],"Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold."
[OTH],"Did we do good final show, Grandmama?"
[OTH],"Very good, my girls. I only wish it weren't your last show. I love this country so very much."
[OTH],"Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time to return to Romania."
[OTH],"Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone second to finish getting them ready. This way, girls. Quickly."
[OTH],"Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama?"
[OTH],Your mother did not want you to grow up in Romania. This is our only chance.
[OTH],Nid kelmin da bushka.
[OTH],Nid kelmin da lushka velt
[OTH],Nid kelmin da bushka ayn zolt!
[OTH],M-Mrs. Vladchick?
[OTH],Dash fam da bushka!
[OTH],They're trying to defect!
[OTH],Cauch! We need a boat.
[OTH],"Where to, Mack?"
[OTH],Follow that boat.
[OTH],"Dude, this isn't working."
[OTH],It's Kenny's singing!
[OTH],(Hunh?)
Cartman,"Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!"
[OTH],(I'm singing as good as I can!)
[OTH],"Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again!"
[OTH],"Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders."

[OTH],"No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more MacGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya. Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night?"
[OTH],I don't know. Whoa.
[OTH],We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep?
[OTH],You're from Cirque du Cheville.
[OTH],Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night.
[OTH],Well…
[OTH],"Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow."
[OTH],"Oh, thank you so much."
[OTH],"There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....?"
[OTH],Vladchick.
[OTH],That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.
[OTH],"Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!"

[OTH],And now lesson 4: the complete works of Mozart. Let's begin.
[OTH],(Damn!)
[OTH],"What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer."
[OTH],"Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping."
[OTH],Poor dear must be tired.
[OTH],You're damn right she's tired.
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. ."
[OTH],"Hurry up, you guys!"
Cartman,What's going on?
[OTH],"Dude, you're not gonna believe this."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Hello.
[OTH],Hello.
[OTH],Hi.
[OTH],Hello.
Cartman,No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
[OTH],Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
[OTH],"What's a ""quin-tuplet""?"
[OTH],"Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two."
[OTH],But there's only four of you.
[OTH],"No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia."
[OTH],Hello.
[OTH],"So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?"
[OTH],"No, don't be ridiculous."
[OTH],Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
[OTH],You have your own?
[OTH],"Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first."
[OTH],(Hey!)
Cartman,"But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],Sounds good.
[OTH],Count me in.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"…Oh, and me."
[OTH],All right!
[OTH],"Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up. Hello? Mrs… Mrs., Old Romanian Woman? Ma'am?"
[OTH],"Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha."
[OTH],"No, Dad."
[OTH],A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr.
[OTH],"No, Dad, she's dead!"
[OTH],"What?! Oh, dear Jesus!"
[OTH],It looks like she had a heart attack.
[OTH],No wonder she didn't say good-night.
[OTH],Ew!
[OTH],"Okay, hold it, hold it."
[OTH],Ow!
[OTH],I don't know how to tell. You tell them.
[OTH],"Uh, girls, we… have some bad news."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Um... Everyone who has a grandma, step forward. Uh, not so fast, girls."
[OTH],Randy!
[OTH],Grandmama is dead?
[OTH],What are we going to do now?
Cartman,"You guys, come here. This is totally awesome."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],How can you say that?
Cartman,"Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!"
[OTH],"Oh, yeah!"
[OTH],Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
[OTH],"Well, Stan, it's not really our-"
[OTH],They have nowhere else to go. Please?
[OTH],"Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay."
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes. If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more , you can feed them fishsticks."
[OTH],Mmm.
[OTH],"Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania."
[OTH],"Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world. Back to you, Tom."
[OTH],This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.
[OTH],This could kill our tourism.
[OTH],You know what to do.
[OTH],"Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises."
[OTH],(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
[OTH],"Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?"
[OTH],"Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be."
[OTH],(I wanna be really good)
[OTH],"Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative."
[OTH],(Europe?)
[OTH],We can't afford that.
[OTH],"Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack."
[OTH],(Awww.)
[OTH],"Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and… you can sing on the way to make money."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago."
[OTH],Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],That's your dad?
[OTH],Maybe.
[OTH],But we haven't seen papa for more than five years.
[OTH],How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.
[OTH],Nadia!
[OTH],"Nadia, my sweet Barshta"
[OTH],Baltania!
[OTH],"Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right."
[OTH],"Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going."
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??"
[OTH],"Well, I… think we… have to,… don't we?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there."
Cartman,Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
[OTH],We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do.
Cartman,"Damn, we might be screwed."
[OTH],No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on!
Cartman,"You see, in America we have… log rides! Bacon double-cheeseburgers! Sheep-shearing contests!"
[OTH],Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah.
Cartman,And shopping malls! Hooray!
[OTH],(Woo hoo!)
[OTH],"Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand, the father has right to his children."
[OTH],"Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you all stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away."
[OTH],Okay. Heh!
[OTH],Our home is Romania. We love it there.
[OTH],"Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there."
[OTH],"If daughters will not return on their own, you must force them to return"
[OTH],"Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest."
[OTH],Protest?
[OTH],"Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible."
[OTH],Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!
[OTH],"Fur is murder! Fur is murder! Oh, what are we protesting here?"
[OTH],Romania sucks!
[OTH],"Oh, let's see Here we go. Romania sucks!"
[OTH],Romania sucks! Romania sucks!
[OTH],Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.
[OTH],That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
[OTH],"Attention, people inside the house! You must return the quintuplets to their father! You have until… Oh yeah, that's good. You have until Easter Sunday to comply."
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],Boooo!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Okay, let's try it again. Hup!"
[OTH],Hup!
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Stan, we-"
[OTH],"Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania."
[OTH],"No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America."
[OTH],"Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls."
[OTH],Now what do we do?
[OTH],"Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets."
[OTH],"Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan."
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say…"
[OTH],"""Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny."""
[OTH],Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?
[OTH],Ready.
[OTH],Code blue!
[OTH],Code blue!
[OTH],"Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School."
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],How much is all this gonna cost?
[OTH],"Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because we are so God-damned poor."
[OTH],"Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here."
[OTH],"Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny. Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I brought for ya."
[OTH],"Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart."
[OTH],"Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb."
[OTH],"Oh, look. An Easter egg."
[OTH],"Oh, shi-"
[OTH],"That's it. Let's move, move move move, move! Give us the kids, now! Now!"
[OTH],Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor!
[OTH],Find them!
[OTH],This is a bust! Hand over the quints! Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!!
[OTH],What the hell's goin' on?!
[OTH],"Freeze, asshole!"
[OTH],"Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya!"
[OTH],"Don't push me, man!"
[OTH],"Pull the trigger, you little pussy!"
[OTH],Gaahhh!
[OTH],Gun! Gun!
[OTH],Down! Down!
[OTH],Riot! Riot!
[OTH],Pepper spray! Pepper spray!
[OTH],Go ahead! In the van!
[OTH],"Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!"
[OTH],"Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him."
[OTH],"Good job, Kenny."
[OTH],"Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it?"
[OTH],"Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind."
[OTH],(Sure!)
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!"
Cartman,"Dude, what the hell happened?"
[OTH],The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
[OTH],"Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!"
[OTH],"Yeah! Well, not this time!"
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side! Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!"
[OTH],Hmm.
[OTH],Yeaahh.
[OTH],I don't know. I usually like to stop protesting by 5:30.
[OTH],"Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?"
[OTH],"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Down with Japan!
[OTH],Alright. We just need to get a few more pictures of the girls reunited with their father so everyone knows they're happy.
[OTH],"Come on, girls. Smile. We want you to look happy. Smile. Look at the silly frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look at him. I've got- Look at him. It's so silly. ""I'm so silly."""
[OTH],"Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and- Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much. Man."
[OTH],Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
[OTH],"You can't see them, boys. They're happily reunited with their father."
[OTH],"Come on, angry mob!"
[OTH],Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.
[OTH],"Alright, it is time for us to return to Romania."
[OTH],What is that?
[OTH],It's the protesters. They're back.
[OTH],God-damnit! We'll take care of them. Come on!
[OTH],Let's move. Move!
[OTH],"Come on, come on, come on."
[OTH],"Come oonn, come oonn."
[OTH],This is government property!
[OTH],Let the quints stay!
[OTH],You ruined my house!
[OTH],"What are you doing, Nadia?"
[OTH],I'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us.
Cartman,Take that!
[OTH],Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
[OTH],All of you are acting like idiots!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],None of you care about us. You only care about yourselves!
[OTH],"Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago , and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake!"
Cartman,"Yeah, you suck, dude!"
[OTH],"And you Romanian leaders , you don't care about us! All you care about is making America look stupid!"
Cartman,"Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!"
[OTH],And you protesters! Don't you have anything better to do?! Get a life!
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],And you boys are the worst of all!
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"You know nothing about Romania, and yet you assume America is so much better! Maybe Romania isn't as nice as America, but it is our home! We are Romanian! All you care about is your own stupid circus!"
[OTH],"Where are you going, girls?"
[OTH],The only place we can go. We're going on Oprah and then a book tour.
[OTH],Yes. You can all kiss our little white Romanian asses!
[OTH],"Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways."
Cartman,"Yeah, screw them!"
[OTH],Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
[OTH],Whatever happened to Kenny?
[OTH],Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay!
[OTH],"Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us!"
[OTH],Boooo!

[OTH],"Okay, okay!"
[OTH],"I mean it, lady, you've got about-! Whoops."
[OTH],"Okay, is everyone ready to go?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville."
[OTH],"Me too. We were lucky to get tickets. Come on, boys! We're gonna be late."
[OTH],"Oh, don't they look precious?"
[OTH],"Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns"
[OTH],"No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things.."
[OTH],Awwww!
[OTH],Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!
[OTH],"Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!"
[OTH],"Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each other's faces!"
[OTH],"Come on, everybody, let's go."
[OTH],"Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man."
[OTH],"Oh, this is so exciting"
[OTH],"Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley."
[OTH],"Where? Oh, no. Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye. No, thank you. Go away, please."
Cartman,"He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it! Ow."
[OTH],"You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley?"
Cartman,"Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts from bursting out of my sides!"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during Sarque du Son Bleu."
Cartman,"Sarque du Son Bleu. Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain."
[OTH],"Eric, sshhhh."
[OTH],How long does this thing last?
[OTH],Two hours.
Cartman,Awwwgh.
[OTH],"Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania."
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
Cartman,Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers?
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],"Damn, dude."
Cartman,Yayy!
[OTH],(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Oh, that was wonderful!"
[OTH],"Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again."
[OTH],Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
Cartman,"Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!"
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!"
Cartman,Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on!
[OTH],"Don't forget to buy your souvenirs, folks."
[OTH],"Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?"
Cartman,"Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash."
[OTH],"Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over."
[OTH],Let's go practice.
[OTH],"Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold."
[OTH],"Did we do good final show, Grandmama?"
[OTH],"Very good, my girls. I only wish it weren't your last show. I love this country so very much."
[OTH],"Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time to return to Romania."
[OTH],"Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone second to finish getting them ready. This way, girls. Quickly."
[OTH],"Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama?"
[OTH],Your mother did not want you to grow up in Romania. This is our only chance.

[OTH],(Hunh?)
Cartman,"Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!"
[OTH],(I'm singing as good as I can!)
[OTH],"Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again!"
[OTH],"Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders."

If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more , you can feed them fishsticks."
[OTH],Mmm.
[OTH],"Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania."
[OTH],"Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world. Back to you, Tom."
[OTH],This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.
[OTH],This could kill our tourism.
[OTH],You know what to do.
[OTH],"Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises."
[OTH],(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
[OTH],"Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?"
[OTH],"Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be."
[OTH],(I wanna be really good)
[OTH],"Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative."
[OTH],(Europe?)
[OTH],We can't afford that.
[OTH],"Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack."
[OTH],(Awww.)
[OTH],"Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and… you can sing on the way to make money."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago."
[OTH],Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],That's your dad?
[OTH],Maybe.
[OTH],But we haven't seen papa for more than five years.
[OTH],How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.
[OTH],Nadia!
[OTH],"Nadia, my sweet Barshta"
[OTH],Baltania!
[OTH],"Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right."
[OTH],"Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going."
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??"
[OTH],"Well, I… think we… have to,… don't we?"
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there."
Cartman,Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
[OTH],We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do.
Cartman,"Damn, we might be screwed."
[OTH],No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on!
Cartman,"You see, in America we have… log rides! Bacon double-cheeseburgers! Sheep-shearing contests!"
[OTH],Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah.
Cartman,And shopping malls! Hooray!
[OTH],(Woo hoo!)
[OTH],"Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand, the father has right to his children."
[OTH],"Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you all stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away."
[OTH],Okay. Heh!
[OTH],Our home is Romania. We love it there.
[OTH],"Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there."
[OTH],"If daughters will not return on their own, you must force them to return"
[OTH],"Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest."
[OTH],Protest?
[OTH],"Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible."
[OTH],Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!
[OTH],"Fur is murder! Fur is murder! Oh, what are we protesting here?"
[OTH],Romania sucks!
[OTH],"Oh, let's see Here we go. Romania sucks!"
[OTH],Romania sucks! Romania sucks!
[OTH],Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.
[OTH],That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
[OTH],"Attention, people inside the house! You must return the quintuplets to their father! You have until… Oh yeah, that's good. You have until Easter Sunday to comply."
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],Boooo!
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Okay, let's try it again. Hup!"
[OTH],Hup!
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Stan, we-"
[OTH],"Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania."
[OTH],"No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America."
[OTH],"Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??"
[OTH],"I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls."
[OTH],Now what do we do?
[OTH],"Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets."
[OTH],"Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan."
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say…"
[OTH],"""Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny."""
[OTH],Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?
[OTH],Ready.
[OTH],Code blue!
[OTH],Code blue!
[OTH],"Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School."
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],How much is all this gonna cost?
[OTH],"Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because we are so God-damned poor."
[OTH],"Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here."
[OTH],"Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny. Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I brought for ya."
[OTH],"Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart."
[OTH],"Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb."
[OTH],"Oh, look. An Easter egg."
[OTH],"Oh, shi-"
[OTH],"That's it. Let's move, move move move, move! Give us the kids, now! Now!"
[OTH],Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor!
[OTH],Find them!
[OTH],This is a bust! Hand over the quints! Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!!
[OTH],What the hell's goin' on?!
[OTH],"Freeze, asshole!"
[OTH],"Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya!"
[OTH],"Don't push me, man!"
[OTH],"Pull the trigger, you little pussy!"
[OTH],Gaahhh!
[OTH],Gun! Gun!
[OTH],Down! Down!
[OTH],Riot! Riot!
[OTH],Pepper spray! Pepper spray!
[OTH],Go ahead! In the van!
[OTH],"Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!"
[OTH],"Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him."
[OTH],"Good job, Kenny."
[OTH],"Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it?"
[OTH],"Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind."
[OTH],(Sure!)
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!"
Cartman,"Dude, what the hell happened?"
[OTH],The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
[OTH],"Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!"
[OTH],"Yeah! Well, not this time!"
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side! Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!"
[OTH],Hmm.
[OTH],Yeaahh.
[OTH],I don't know. I usually like to stop protesting by 5:30.
[OTH],"Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?"
[OTH],"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Down with Japan!
[OTH],Alright. We just need to get a few more pictures of the girls reunited with their father so everyone knows they're happy.
[OTH],"Come on, girls. Smile. We want you to look happy. Smile. Look at the silly frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look at him. I've got- Look at him. It's so silly. ""I'm so silly."""
[OTH],"Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and- Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much. Man."
[OTH],Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
[OTH],"You can't see them, boys. They're happily reunited with their father."
[OTH],"Come on, angry mob!"
[OTH],Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.
[OTH],"Alright, it is time for us to return to Romania."
[OTH],What is that?
[OTH],It's the protesters. They're back.
[OTH],God-damnit! We'll take care of them. Come on!
[OTH],Let's move. Move!
[OTH],"Come on, come on, come on."
[OTH],"Come oonn, come oonn."
[OTH],This is government property!
[OTH],Let the quints stay!
[OTH],You ruined my house!
[OTH],"What are you doing, Nadia?"
[OTH],I'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us.
Cartman,Take that!
[OTH],Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
[OTH],All of you are acting like idiots!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],None of you care about us. You only care about yourselves!
[OTH],"Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago , and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake!"
Cartman,"Yeah, you suck, dude!"
[OTH],"And you Romanian leaders , you don't care about us! All you care about is making America look stupid!"
Cartman,"Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!"
[OTH],And you protesters! Don't you have anything better to do?! Get a life!
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],And you boys are the worst of all!
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"You know nothing about Romania, and yet you assume America is so much better! Maybe Romania isn't as nice as America, but it is our home! We are Romanian! All you care about is your own stupid circus!"
[OTH],"Where are you going, girls?"
[OTH],The only place we can go. We're going on Oprah and then a book tour.
[OTH],Yes. You can all kiss our little white Romanian asses!
[OTH],"Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways."
Cartman,"Yeah, screw them!"
[OTH],Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
[OTH],Whatever happened to Kenny?
[OTH],Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay!
[OTH],"Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us!"
[OTH],Boooo!
[OTH],"Shut up, Romanians! All right, let's go. Move move move move!"
[OTH],"Hand over the boy, now!"
[OTH],"Okay, okay!"
[OTH],"I mean it, lady, you've got about-! Whoops."
Cartman,"Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card! You can deny it, or cover it up."
[OTH],"Dude, I don't understand this game at all."
Cartman,"It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up."
[OTH],"Um, deny it?"
Cartman,"Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says."
[OTH],"Hello, I'm Bill Kurtis. Many believe that the U.S. Government... covered it up. I'm Bill Kurtis."
[OTH],"Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card. You lose a turn."
[OTH],Sweet.
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,I just gave you AIDS.
[OTH],AIDS?!
[OTH],"Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS."
Cartman,"Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns and 800 points."
[OTH],"Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?"
[OTH],(No.)
[OTH],"We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh."
Cartman,"God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars."
[OTH],"You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!"
Cartman,"...You see. Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here ."
[OTH],"You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!"
Cartman,"Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah! — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah. SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME."
[OTH],I'm Bill Kurtis.
Cartman,"I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog. Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog! I can meet new friends on the Internet! Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys"" That's perfect. Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li- Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316. Hi Tony. ""So what are you into?"" Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face. ""Kewl. Wanna get together? Smiley-face?"" Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face. ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning."" Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face. You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!"
Cartman,"Hi, are you Tony?"
[OTH],Yeah. You're -Eric?
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],I brought you some candy.
Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],And some books on Kama Sutra.
Cartman,"Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now."
[OTH],Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
Cartman,"Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks."
[OTH],"Hold it right there, scumbag!"
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],We monitored your little online chat. Now you're coming with us!
[OTH],No!
Cartman,What the hell just happened?
[OTH],"You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby."
[OTH],"Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby."
[OTH],"Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers!"
[OTH],You have to share your room with the baby!
[OTH],The baby.
[OTH],The baby!
[OTH],The baby!!
[OTH],(HAAAAAAAAGH!)
[OTH],Stop it!
[OTH],"Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again."
[OTH],"Oh, alright."
[OTH],"(Dad, I wanna play catch.)"
[OTH],"Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son."
[OTH],(But I wanna play now!)
[OTH],"Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards."
[OTH],"Aw, alright."
[OTH],"Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it! Good job. Now throw me one. Ohp! Guhhogh!"
[OTH],What happened?!
[OTH],"Aw, he smacked me in the balls!"
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
Cartman,"Okay, we'll try this again. Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to- Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy. Hello, HungDaddy. ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf. Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets. Midgets piss me off. Frowny face. Lemme see, how about this one?"
Cartman,Mister Hammerhead?
[OTH],Hi there.
Cartman,Mr. Garrison??
[OTH],Haah! Eric!
Cartman,You wanna be my friend?
[OTH],"Oh, crap!"
Cartman,"That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?"
[OTH],"Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing!"
[OTH],"Alright, scumbag, we got you!"
[OTH],"Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me."
[OTH],"Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chat—now, you're coming with us!"
[OTH],No-o!
Cartman,"Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!"
[OTH],"See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines. Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out."
[OTH],"Oh, man, that's terrible."
[OTH],"I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this. Waaaaah!"
[OTH],"Haha, he-yeah ha. Haaaaah."
[OTH],Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
[OTH],Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!"
[OTH],We're making faces at sick people.
Cartman,"No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?!"
[OTH],We don't know.
Cartman,"I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!"
[OTH],"We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt."
Cartman,"Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!"
[OTH],"You're not more mature than us, Cartman!"
Cartman,YES I AM!!
[OTH],"I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],"Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants."
[OTH],O-ogh!
[OTH],Do you like having your back rubbed?
[OTH],"Eat me, pervert!"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],We demand you release these men at once!
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?"
[OTH],"Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters."
[OTH],"Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!"
[OTH],"Yeah, uh-huh."
[OTH],"Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI."
[OTH],Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
[OTH],Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
[OTH],"Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!"
[OTH],All these men wanted was to love a young boy! There is nothing wrong with love!
[OTH],"I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age. Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!"
[OTH],"You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong. Come on, men!"
[OTH],"Wow, they've got activists for everything these days."
[OTH],"I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese. Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick- Who could that be? Why, it's little Eric Cartman."
Cartman,"Dr. Mephesto, I need help."
[OTH],"Well of course, come in."
Cartman,"You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me."
[OTH],"Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people."
Cartman,Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA."
Cartman,NAMBLA?
[OTH],Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
Cartman,"Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto!"
[OTH],Sure!
[OTH],"Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy."
[OTH],Awwww.
[OTH],"And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws, we want the same!"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeh-hehah-hah.
[OTH],"What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a- Can we... help you?"
Cartman,Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
[OTH],You... do?
Cartman,Sure.
[OTH],"Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus."
Cartman,...Sweet.
[OTH],"Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister."
[OTH],(No!!)
[OTH],"Yup, it's for sure!"
[OTH],"And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!"
[OTH],"Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room."
[OTH],"Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny."
[OTH],Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
[OTH],(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.)
Cartman,Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
[OTH],"What are you talking about, fatass?"
Cartman,"Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all. It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!"
[OTH],"Can I help you, young lady?"
[OTH],(Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)
[OTH],"Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there."
[OTH],(Thanks.)
[OTH],"Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents. Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?"
[OTH],(Cash.)
[OTH],"(Look, Mom. I made you something to drink.)"
[OTH],"Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink."
[OTH],(What?)
[OTH],"Well, I can still drink."
[OTH],(No! Daddy!)
[OTH],"Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls. What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of... Who-o-oa."
[OTH],What's the matter?
[OTH],(Uh oh.)
[OTH],"Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants!"
[OTH],"Oohhh, God! Oooh, my balls! Ooh, God"
[OTH],"Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child."
Cartman,"Thanks, dude."
[OTH],"Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child."
Cartman,Really? Awesome!
[OTH],"Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends."
Cartman,"Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature, excluding Stan and Kyle, of course."
[OTH],"Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready."
Cartman,KIIICK ASS!
[OTH],Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby.
[OTH],"Hey, are you feeling down? You need some excitement. And North Park Funland has just opened its newest ride! The John Denver Experience! You'll be Rocky Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME, INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT."
[OTH],It was-
[OTH],-fun.
[OTH],-fun.
[OTH],Note: people with heart conditions and expectant mothers should not ride the JOHN DENVER! Open now! Come on down!
[OTH],(Mom!)
[OTH],Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
[OTH],"Oh, it's all right. You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy."
[OTH],"Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride at the John Denver Experience. Have fun."
[OTH],What did he say? ...John Denver Experience.
[OTH],"Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!"
[OTH],"Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm not gonna make it! I'm gonna be sick! Oh, my stomach! Oh, my nose! Gross!"
Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor."
[OTH],They are?
Cartman,"We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!"
[OTH],We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
Cartman,"Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go."
[OTH],We don't wanna go!
Cartman,You can't go.
[OTH],We don't WANNA go!
Cartman,"No, you CAN'T go. Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out"
[OTH],"Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature."
[OTH],"Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too."
[OTH],"You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick. It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life."
[OTH],(Eeww.)
[OTH],I can see its head!
[OTH],You can?
[OTH],"Push, now. Push hard! Oh my God."
[OTH],What is it??
[OTH],It's ali-
[OTH],"Oh my God, it killed Kenny!"
[OTH],"Bad baby, bad!"
[OTH],(Huh. Huh??) (That does it!)
[OTH],"Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'? Uh what are you doing, Kenny? Kenny, what are you going to plunge?"
[OTH],(AAAARRRRHHH!)
[OTH],Aaaaaaah! AAAAA!
[OTH],"Kenny, what the hell are you doing?!"
Cartman,"What the hell? Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!"
[OTH],"We got invited too, fatass!"
Cartman,"Hunh. Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA."
[OTH],"Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],"First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys."
Cartman,Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
[OTH],"Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members."
[OTH],This is boring.
[OTH],"Yeah. HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?"
[OTH],Ho hohohoho
[OTH],Woohoohoohoohoo.
[OTH],"Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... ""get"" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick."
[OTH],"Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful , bright, little boy."
[OTH],"Well, uh I sure am, I guess."
[OTH],And his skin is as soft as fresh linen.
[OTH],That seems kind of... weird.
[OTH],"Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose."
[OTH],"Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris?"
[OTH],"Well, I want to announce that I may have found the dream boy of the decade. He's sexy, sassy, and full of spunk. His name is Timmy."
[OTH],"TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?"
[OTH],"Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance!"
[OTH],"Alright, I want those perverted bastards all taken in. Got it?"
[OTH],Got it!
[OTH],"Hello, NAMBLA members. As the South Park representative-"
[OTH],Hold it right there!
[OTH],Freeze!
[OTH],Don't nobody move!
[OTH],What's going on?
[OTH],"Alright, sickos. Where are the children?!"
[OTH],What children?
[OTH],"This... is... NAMBLA, right?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],The North American Man/Boy Love Association?
[OTH],What? No! We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes.
[OTH],"Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA."
[OTH],"Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place."
[OTH],Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!
[OTH],You know of them?
[OTH],Know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to nambla.com!
[OTH],"Yeah, those perverted bastards!"
[OTH],Wow. You guys really do look a lot like Marlon Brando.
[OTH],"Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children!"
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah!
[OTH],And let's kick their asses for stealin' our domain name!
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, members, that's enough of that. It's time for all of us to retire to our respective rooms, and get to know our new young boys."
[OTH],All right.
[OTH],Alright.
[OTH],Dude. Being mature is boring!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm."
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
[OTH],"I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here!"
[OTH],"Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide!"
[OTH],"Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got to be here somewhere. Let's try this room."
[OTH],Let's get those perverts!
[OTH],Sacrebleu!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],"Kenny, no! Leave me alone"
[OTH],"(Come here, mom! Let me get it!)"
[OTH],Kenny??
[OTH],"Zis time, I will not drop zeh food. Allo!"
[OTH],It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's the boys?!
[OTH],Sacre bleu!
[OTH],I think the boys went in here.
[OTH],Aaaaaah!
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys?
[OTH],"Kenny, GIVE IT UP!"
[OTH],(Come on!)
[OTH],Waaah!
[OTH],"Alright, you're under arrest!"
[OTH],No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again!
[OTH],Damnit!
[OTH],"Hey, we didn't try that room!"
[OTH],Sacre bleu.
[OTH],Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
Cartman,They're all over the place.
[OTH],Timmiihhh!
[OTH],What are we gonna do?!
[OTH],"Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out."
[OTH],How?
Cartman,"Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team. And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters."
[OTH],"Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?"
Cartman,"Now, are you a team player or not?!"
[OTH],"Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess."
Cartman,"Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team."""
[OTH],Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Cartman,"Just go, Butters. We're running out of time."
[OTH],Well uuh-uuh-alright then.
Cartman,"Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass."
[OTH],"Well, alright men. Here, here I come. I'm ready to take one for the team."
[OTH],"Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans!"
[OTH],"Oh, one of the boys just came in."
[OTH],"What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH!"
[OTH],"Are you alright, Stuart?"
[OTH],"Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old men—I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath!"
[OTH],"We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?"
[OTH],"Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today. Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called ""freedom."" They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live. You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand."
[OTH],Dude. You have sex with children.
[OTH],"We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away."
[OTH],Dude. You have sex with children.
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you."
[OTH],Seriously.
[OTH],"Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time."
[OTH],"Well, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Well, what?"
[OTH],Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There."
[OTH],"And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?"
Cartman,"No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long."
[OTH],"Okay, let's roll."
[OTH],"Dr. Flores, dial 18-"
[OTH],"Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo."
[OTH],"Our little angel, yes."
[OTH],"Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him."
[OTH],What should we name him?
[OTH],"Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny."
[OTH],"Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)"
[OTH],"God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened."
[OTH],Fifty-second.
Cartman,"Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card! You can deny it, or cover it up."
[OTH],"Dude, I don't understand this game at all."
Cartman,"It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up."
[OTH],"Um, deny it?"
Cartman,"Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says."
[OTH],"Hello, I'm Bill Kurtis. Many believe that the U.S. Government... covered it up. I'm Bill Kurtis."
[OTH],"Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card. You lose a turn."
[OTH],Sweet.
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,I just gave you AIDS.
[OTH],AIDS?!
[OTH],"Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS."
Cartman,"Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns and 800 points."
[OTH],"Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?"
[OTH],(No.)
[OTH],"We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh."
Cartman,"God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars."
[OTH],"You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!"
Cartman,"...You see. Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here ."
[OTH],"You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!"
Cartman,"Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah! — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah. SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME."
[OTH],I'm Bill Kurtis.
Cartman,"I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog. Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog! I can meet new friends on the Internet! Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys"" That's perfect. Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li- Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316. Hi Tony. ""So what are you into?"" Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face. ""Kewl. Wanna get together? Smiley-face?"" Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face. ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning."" Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face. You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!"
Cartman,"Hi, are you Tony?"
[OTH],Yeah. You're -Eric?
Cartman,Yeah!
[OTH],I brought you some candy.
Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],And some books on Kama Sutra.
Cartman,"Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now."
[OTH],Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
Cartman,"Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks."
[OTH],"Hold it right there, scumbag!"
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],We monitored your little online chat. Now you're coming with us!
[OTH],No!
Cartman,What the hell just happened?
[OTH],"You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby."
[OTH],"Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby."
[OTH],"Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers!"
[OTH],You have to share your room with the baby!
[OTH],The baby.
[OTH],The baby!
[OTH],The baby!!
[OTH],(HAAAAAAAAGH!)
[OTH],Stop it!
[OTH],"Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again."
[OTH],"Oh, alright."
[OTH],"(Dad, I wanna play catch.)"
[OTH],"Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son."
[OTH],(But I wanna play now!)
[OTH],"Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards."
[OTH],"Aw, alright."
[OTH],"Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it! Good job. Now throw me one. Ohp! Guhhogh!"
[OTH],What happened?!
[OTH],"Aw, he smacked me in the balls!"
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
Cartman,"Okay, we'll try this again. Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to- Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy. Hello, HungDaddy. ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf. Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets. Midgets piss me off. Frowny face. Lemme see, how about this one?"
Cartman,Mister Hammerhead?
[OTH],Hi there.
Cartman,Mr. Garrison??
[OTH],Haah! Eric!
Cartman,You wanna be my friend?
[OTH],"Oh, crap!"
Cartman,"That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?"
[OTH],"Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing!"
[OTH],"Alright, scumbag, we got you!"
[OTH],"Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me."
[OTH],"Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chat—now, you're coming with us!"
[OTH],No-o!
Cartman,"Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!"
[OTH],"See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines. Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out."
[OTH],"Oh, man, that's terrible."
[OTH],"I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this. Waaaaah!"
[OTH],"Haha, he-yeah ha. Haaaaah."
[OTH],Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
[OTH],Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!"
[OTH],We're making faces at sick people.
Cartman,"No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?!"
[OTH],We don't know.
Cartman,"I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!"
[OTH],"We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt."
Cartman,"Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!"
[OTH],"You're not more mature than us, Cartman!"
Cartman,YES I AM!!
[OTH],"I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady."
[OTH],"Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants."
[OTH],O-ogh!
[OTH],Do you like having your back rubbed?
[OTH],"Eat me, pervert!"
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],We demand you release these men at once!
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?"
[OTH],"Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters."
[OTH],"Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!"
[OTH],"Yeah, uh-huh."
[OTH],"Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI."
[OTH],Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
[OTH],Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
[OTH],"Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!"
[OTH],All these men wanted was to love a young boy! There is nothing wrong with love!
[OTH],"I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age. Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!"
[OTH],"You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong. Come on, men!"
[OTH],"Wow, they've got activists for everything these days."
[OTH],"I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese. Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick- Who could that be? Why, it's little Eric Cartman."
Cartman,"Dr. Mephesto, I need help."
[OTH],"Well of course, come in."
Cartman,"You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me."
[OTH],"Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people."
Cartman,Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA."
Cartman,NAMBLA?
[OTH],Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
Cartman,"Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto!"
[OTH],Sure!
[OTH],"Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy."
[OTH],Awwww.
[OTH],"And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws, we want the same!"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeh-hehah-hah.
[OTH],"What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a- Can we... help you?"
Cartman,Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
[OTH],You... do?
Cartman,Sure.
[OTH],"Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus."
Cartman,...Sweet.
[OTH],"Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister."
[OTH],(No!!)
[OTH],"Yup, it's for sure!"
[OTH],"And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!"
[OTH],"Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room."
[OTH],"Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny."
[OTH],Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
[OTH],(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.)
Cartman,Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
[OTH],"What are you talking about, fatass?"
Cartman,"Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all. It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!"
[OTH],"Can I help you, young lady?"
[OTH],(Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)
[OTH],"Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there."
[OTH],(Thanks.)
[OTH],"Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents. Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?"
[OTH],(Cash.)
[OTH],"(Look, Mom. I made you something to drink.)"
[OTH],"Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink."
[OTH],(What?)
[OTH],"Well, I can still drink."
[OTH],(No! Daddy!)
[OTH],"Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls. What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of... Who-o-oa."
[OTH],What's the matter?
[OTH],(Uh oh.)
[OTH],"Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants!"
[OTH],"Oohhh, God! Oooh, my balls! Ooh, God"
[OTH],"Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child."
Cartman,"Thanks, dude."
[OTH],"Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child."
Cartman,Really? Awesome!
[OTH],"Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends."
Cartman,"Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature, excluding Stan and Kyle, of course."
[OTH],"Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready."
Cartman,KIIICK ASS!
[OTH],Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby.
[OTH],"Hey, are you feeling down? You need some excitement. And North Park Funland has just opened its newest ride! The John Denver Experience! You'll be Rocky Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME, INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT."
[OTH],It was-
[OTH],-fun.
[OTH],-fun.
[OTH],Note: people with heart conditions and expectant mothers should not ride the JOHN DENVER! Open now! Come on down!
[OTH],(Mom!)
[OTH],Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
[OTH],"Oh, it's all right. You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy."
[OTH],"Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride at the John Denver Experience. Have fun."
[OTH],What did he say? ...John Denver Experience.
[OTH],"Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!"
[OTH],"Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm not gonna make it! I'm gonna be sick! Oh, my stomach! Oh, my nose! Gross!"
Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor."
[OTH],They are?
Cartman,"We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!"
[OTH],We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
Cartman,"Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go."
[OTH],We don't wanna go!
Cartman,You can't go.
[OTH],We don't WANNA go!
Cartman,"No, you CAN'T go. Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out"
[OTH],"Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature."
[OTH],"Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too."
[OTH],"You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick. It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life."
[OTH],(Eeww.)
[OTH],I can see its head!
[OTH],You can?
[OTH],"Push, now. Push hard! Oh my God."
[OTH],What is it??
[OTH],It's ali-
[OTH],"Oh my God, it killed Kenny!"
[OTH],"Bad baby, bad!"
[OTH],(Huh. Huh??) (That does it!)
[OTH],"Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'? Uh what are you doing, Kenny? Kenny, what are you going to plunge?"
[OTH],(AAAARRRRHHH!)
[OTH],Aaaaaaah! AAAAA!
[OTH],"Kenny, what the hell are you doing?!"
Cartman,"What the hell? Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!"
[OTH],"We got invited too, fatass!"
Cartman,"Hunh. Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA."
[OTH],"Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],"First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys."
Cartman,Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
[OTH],"Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members."
[OTH],This is boring.
[OTH],"Yeah. HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?"
[OTH],Ho hohohoho
[OTH],Woohoohoohoohoo.
[OTH],"Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... ""get"" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick."
[OTH],"Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful , bright, little boy."
[OTH],"Well, uh I sure am, I guess."
[OTH],And his skin is as soft as fresh linen.
[OTH],That seems kind of... weird.
[OTH],"Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose."
[OTH],"Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris?"
[OTH],"Well, I want to announce that I may have found the dream boy of the decade. He's sexy, sassy, and full of spunk. His name is Timmy."
[OTH],"TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?"
[OTH],"Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance!"
[OTH],"Alright, I want those perverted bastards all taken in. Got it?"
[OTH],Got it!
[OTH],"Hello, NAMBLA members. As the South Park representative-"
[OTH],Hold it right there!
[OTH],Freeze!
[OTH],Don't nobody move!
[OTH],What's going on?
[OTH],"Alright, sickos. Where are the children?!"
[OTH],What children?
[OTH],"This... is... NAMBLA, right?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],The North American Man/Boy Love Association?
[OTH],What? No! We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes.
[OTH],"Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA."
[OTH],"Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place."
[OTH],Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!
[OTH],You know of them?
[OTH],Know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to nambla.com!
[OTH],"Yeah, those perverted bastards!"
[OTH],Wow. You guys really do look a lot like Marlon Brando.
[OTH],"Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children!"
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah!
[OTH],And let's kick their asses for stealin' our domain name!
[OTH],Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, members, that's enough of that. It's time for all of us to retire to our respective rooms, and get to know our new young boys."
[OTH],All right.
[OTH],Alright.
[OTH],Dude. Being mature is boring!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm."
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
[OTH],"I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here!"
[OTH],"Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide!"
[OTH],"Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got to be here somewhere. Let's try this room."
[OTH],Let's get those perverts!
[OTH],Sacrebleu!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Aaah!
[OTH],"Kenny, no! Leave me alone"
[OTH],"(Come here, mom! Let me get it!)"
[OTH],Kenny??
[OTH],"Zis time, I will not drop zeh food. Allo!"
[OTH],It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's the boys?!
[OTH],Sacre bleu!
[OTH],I think the boys went in here.
[OTH],Aaaaaah!
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys?
[OTH],"Kenny, GIVE IT UP!"
[OTH],(Come on!)
[OTH],Waaah!
[OTH],"Alright, you're under arrest!"
[OTH],No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again!
[OTH],Damnit!
[OTH],"Hey, we didn't try that room!"
[OTH],Sacre bleu.
[OTH],Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
Cartman,They're all over the place.
[OTH],Timmiihhh!
[OTH],What are we gonna do?!
[OTH],"Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out."
[OTH],How?
Cartman,"Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team. And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters."
[OTH],"Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?"
Cartman,"Now, are you a team player or not?!"
[OTH],"Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess."
Cartman,"Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team."""
[OTH],Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Cartman,"Just go, Butters. We're running out of time."
[OTH],Well uuh-uuh-alright then.
Cartman,"Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass."
[OTH],"Well, alright men. Here, here I come. I'm ready to take one for the team."
[OTH],"Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans!"
[OTH],"Oh, one of the boys just came in."
[OTH],"What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH!"
[OTH],"Are you alright, Stuart?"
[OTH],"Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old men—I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath!"
[OTH],"We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?"
[OTH],"Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today. Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called ""freedom."" They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live. You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand."
[OTH],Dude. You have sex with children.
[OTH],"We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away."
[OTH],Dude. You have sex with children.
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you."
[OTH],Seriously.
[OTH],"Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time."
[OTH],"Well, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Well, what?"
[OTH],Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There."
[OTH],"And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?"
Cartman,"No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long."
[OTH],"Okay, let's roll."
[OTH],"Dr. Flores, dial 18-"
[OTH],"Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo."
[OTH],"Our little angel, yes."
[OTH],"Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him."
[OTH],What should we name him?
[OTH],"Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny."
[OTH],"Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)"
[OTH],"God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened."
[OTH],Fifty-second.
[OTH],"Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland."
Cartman,"Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher."
[OTH],"Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers. But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm. Eric Cartman?"
[OTH],Here!
[OTH],"Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?"
[OTH],(Here.)
[OTH],"It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus."
[OTH],"Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick?"
Cartman,"Here. Oh, hoho. Ow."
[OTH],"Dude, what the hell was that?"
Cartman,"Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!"
[OTH],"...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk."
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
Cartman,"Not with me, man."
[OTH],"Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today. I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — Kyle Broflovski?"
[OTH],He's fakin'!
[OTH],"Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it."
[OTH],Awww.
Cartman,He's fakin'!
[OTH],"Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too."
Cartman,But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
[OTH],I don't care! Get down here and do it!
[OTH],"Hey, watch it! Hey, what are you doin'?"
[OTH],"Now, that's a get-well card!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting."
[OTH],Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?
[OTH],"Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!"
[OTH],"...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about. It's your somewhat substantial police record."
[OTH],"Oh, whatever!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-"
[OTH],"That was not me, that was Mr. Hat!"
[OTH],"All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little ""child molestation"" thing dies down a bit."
[OTH],"Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe."
[OTH],"We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice."
[OTH],Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore. I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun...
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!"
[OTH],"Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?"
[OTH],"Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you."
[OTH],"Hello, sweetie."
[OTH],"Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher. Kyle?"
[OTH],They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
[OTH],"Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look."
[OTH],"Go on, Butters!"
[OTH],"Ho, I don't wanna!"
[OTH],"Butters, go on!"
[OTH],"Oh, uhuh alright, then. We're so sorry you're not feeling well
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune: Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, ""Get well soon!""
And ""Please don't die on us."""
[OTH],"Dude, you really are sick, huh?"
[OTH],"I don't know, I..."
[OTH],"I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous."
[OTH],"Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People."
[OTH],Really? In People?
[OTH],"There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named ""Miss Information."""
[OTH],"Oh, well, with a name like ""Miss Information"" she must know something."
[OTH],Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
[OTH],Okay. I'll get our coats.
[OTH],Can I go now?
[OTH],"I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know."
[OTH],"Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do."
[OTH],I've always wanted to write a novel.
[OTH],"Well, there you go, m'kay?"
[OTH],But I never know what to write about.
[OTH],Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?
[OTH],Besides teaching?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],...Poontang.
[OTH],"M, m'kay"
[OTH],"I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world."
[OTH],"Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel."
[OTH],"Yes, that's it. I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!"
[OTH],"You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins."
[OTH],Toxins?
[OTH],"All the horrible food we eat—the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper."
[OTH],"Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!"
[OTH],"You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all."
[OTH],"Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?"
[OTH],"Don't be a smartass, Stanley."
[OTH],"Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans."
[OTH],"Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually."
[OTH],"Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts
Oh yeah, now this is getting good Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard. His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples Uh, let's see... Diana's nipples... Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck. Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"Oh my, he looks terrible."
[OTH],"Yes, poor little dear."
[OTH],"Good morning, everyone."
[OTH],"Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse."
[OTH],"Huuuuuuuuuh Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter."
[OTH],"Oh, that's great news!"
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],"Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system."
[OTH],Ooooo.
[OTH],Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
[OTH],"Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!"
[OTH],Don't be a smartass?
[OTH],"Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!"
[OTH],"Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner."
[OTH],I agree. Yeah. That's right.
[OTH],Mr. Marsh is here to see you.
[OTH],"Alright, send him in. Oh, Stanley."
[OTH],"Hi, doctor."
[OTH],How can I help you?
[OTH],"Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick."
[OTH],"He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine."
[OTH],But I don't think it's working.
[OTH],"Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die."
[OTH],Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
[OTH],"I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn."
[OTH],"...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care."
[OTH],"That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact, there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle."
[OTH],"Who? Oh, shit."
[OTH],"(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.)"
Cartman,"""Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew Give me the space cruiser, Kenny."
[OTH],"(No, no.)"
Cartman,"Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5."
[OTH],"(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!) (There! It's mine!)"
Cartman,"No, mine. M'yah! Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha bluh oh, ha-ow!"
[OTH],"Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?"
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you."
Cartman,"Okay, mom."
[OTH],And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS.
Cartman,"What's goin' on, guys?"
[OTH],"Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question."
Cartman,Oh-kay.
[OTH],"Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life."
Cartman,Uh huh.
[OTH],What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
Cartman,"Oh, I think I see where this is going."
[OTH],"His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but it's obviously not working."
Cartman,"Stan, why don't you just ask the question?"
[OTH],Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
Cartman,"No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!"
[OTH],"But you only need one, fat boy!"
Cartman,"'No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!"
[OTH],"Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!"
[OTH],(It's not that's fucking serious.)
Cartman,"Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price."
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],How much?
Cartman,"I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!"
Cartman,"Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars."
[OTH],(Ten million dollars??)
[OTH],"What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!"
Cartman,"What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock."
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here."
Cartman,"Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!"
[OTH],"Oooh, free-range aspirin!"
[OTH],All-natural cell phones!
[OTH],"Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez."
[OTH],Ooo.
[OTH],I'd like to buy some more stuff.
[OTH],"Come in. Come here, guys."
[OTH],Do you have any new holistic items for sale?
[OTH],"Oohh, oh yeah. Aah... Here, uh, this is a- uhh, dream...catcher."
[OTH],"Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one."
[OTH],"Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people."
[OTH],"Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural."
[OTH],Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.
[OTH],"Oh yeah. We love the earth, man."
[OTH],"Oh yeah, the earth is great."
[OTH],Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.
[OTH],"Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'."
[OTH],"uh'hm, ho ho hm."
[OTH],Wonderful!
[OTH],Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit.
[OTH],D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We wanna buy more stuff.
[OTH],"Yes. Much, much more stuff."
[OTH],"Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk. Come on."
[OTH],"Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you."
[OTH],Oh yah. You too and junk.
[OTH],"That's funny, man."
[OTH],"Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste."
[OTH],You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],"Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't."
[OTH],"Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE. Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars."
[OTH],"Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally."
[OTH],Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
[OTH],"You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!"
[OTH],And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
[OTH],"Enough, Stanley!"
[OTH],"Nobody wants to listen, Kenny."
[OTH],(I know.)
[OTH],"I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again."
[OTH],(Uh huh.)
[OTH],"I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do. Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live!"
[OTH],(Rrrh!)
[OTH],"Chapter 18.
Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about. Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!
And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused. ""Go on"", Rebecca said softly, ""Touch me."" Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises. They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with... Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?! Oh, Mr. Hat!"
[OTH],"Come on, where are they?"
[OTH],This is it??
[OTH],(Uh huh)
[OTH],Timmiiihh!
[OTH],This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
[OTH],"Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot."
[OTH],"Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!"
[OTH],"Huh, where are we goin'?"
[OTH],We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney.
[OTH],
[OTH],Mom... Do you ever have those heavy flow days?
[OTH],"Oh absolutely sweetheart, everybody does."
[OTH],"Mom, remember the movie The Shining where the elevator doors are opening up.."
[OTH],Oh honey what you need is a more absorbent tampon.
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],"Well, what's the most absorbent thing in the world?"
[OTH],Well... Cherokee hair I guess. But what does that have to do with me?
[OTH],"Because now there is all new, natural Cherokee hair tampons. ."
[OTH],A cotton tampon can hold only so much liquid. Other tampons also come up short. But Cherokee hair has been known for ages to be strong and powerful Each tampon is hand woven from over 200 strands of Cherokee hair and then bound together with these decorative native beads.
[OTH],You were right mom! All natural Cherokee hair tampons really did the trick.
[OTH],And when you're done using them they make a great toy for Jessie. Go get it boy!
[OTH],Grrr... grrrr
[OTH],"Let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons."
Cartman,No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
[OTH],"Okay, it's clear. Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy."
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],Sshhh!
[OTH],Timmiihh.
[OTH],"If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?"
[OTH],(Okay)
[OTH],Timmiihh.
[OTH],"Alright Butters, let's go. Uh-oh, Cartman's pig. Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay. Come on, we gotta get outta here! Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Oh well, we're busted."
Cartman,"Shut up, Fluffy!"
[OTH],"Oh, phew."
Cartman,"Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp!"
[OTH],"Okay, here we go. Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here..."
[OTH],I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
[OTH],"...vein right, well- Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up. No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!"
Cartman,"whatwhatwhatwhat? Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!"
[OTH],"You suck, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!"
[OTH],"God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!"
Cartman,I do! I do care! Look how much. Look. Look how much I care.
[OTH],"First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance."
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, did you read the book?"
[OTH],"Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book."
[OTH],"Well, what did you think?"
[OTH],"Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you."
[OTH],"Ooohhh, why not?"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word ""penis"" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel?"
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel."
[OTH],"Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a ""romance novel."""
[OTH],No?
[OTH],"No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay."
[OTH],What the hell are you talkin' about?!
[OTH],It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs.
[OTH],"Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!"
[OTH],It is.
[OTH],"Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs! Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!"
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],"There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!"
[OTH],(You never seem to care when I die!)
[OTH],"My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it. Oh, God, he's my best friend..."
[OTH],"(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!)"
[OTH],Look out! Oops.
[OTH],Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again!
[OTH],"Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please."
[OTH],"No problem, man. Pay Miss Information up front."
[OTH],"Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever I watch VH1."
[OTH],"Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice."
[OTH],"Wow, I feel better already!"
[OTH],And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son.
[OTH],"Okay, here he is."
[OTH],"Ahahem, that kid looks really sick."
[OTH],Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.
[OTH],"No. I mean, he looks REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor."
[OTH],Hmm?
[OTH],But you're more in touch with the earth.
[OTH],"Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man."
[OTH],It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing.
[OTH],"No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm- I'm more like a- a Mexican."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Hu-uh?!
[OTH],Yeah. A Mexican.
[OTH],"Uugh. Ptu, ptu."
[OTH],I didn't know that.
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],How dare you deceive us like that!
[OTH],"Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that."
[OTH],Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans.
[OTH],"Uh, toxins are your enemy."
[OTH],Kill her!
[OTH],Funny.
[OTH],So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
[OTH],"Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!"
[OTH],"That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan."
Cartman,"Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA! That son of a bitch!"
Cartman,"Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!"
[OTH],"Dude, please. Kyle needs it."
Cartman,"It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!"
[OTH],"Alright, alright, here."
Cartman,"Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before."
[OTH],"Doctor, Eric Cartman is here-"
[OTH],"Why, hello there, Eric."
Cartman,"You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in! Please."
[OTH],"Oh, I see. Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?"
Cartman,"No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!"
[OTH],"Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery. If you'll just sign this release."
Cartman,Thank you.
[OTH],"How are you feeling, boubbie?"
[OTH],"Better, thanks."
[OTH],You look a lot better.
[OTH],"Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick."
[OTH],"Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan."
[OTH],"Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do."
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too."
Cartman,"Heh. Hey, what what's going on?"
[OTH],"Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!"
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney."
[OTH],"Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release."
[OTH],"Isn't that funny, sweetie?"
Cartman,Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
[OTH],"Oh, here's everybody."
[OTH],"Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?"
[OTH],"Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present."
[OTH],Oh. ...Thanks?
Cartman,I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
[OTH],"Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches."
[OTH],Huh? What the?
Cartman,"Oh good, you got the crappy kidney."
[OTH],"Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland."
Cartman,"Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher."
[OTH],"Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers. But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm. Eric Cartman?"
[OTH],Here!
[OTH],"Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?"
[OTH],(Here.)
[OTH],"It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus."
[OTH],"Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick?"
Cartman,"Here. Oh, hoho. Ow."
[OTH],"Dude, what the hell was that?"
Cartman,"Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!"
[OTH],"...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk."
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
Cartman,"Not with me, man."
[OTH],"Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today. I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — Kyle Broflovski?"
[OTH],He's fakin'!
[OTH],"Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it."
[OTH],Awww.
Cartman,He's fakin'!
[OTH],"Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too."
Cartman,But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
[OTH],I don't care! Get down here and do it!
[OTH],"Hey, watch it! Hey, what are you doin'?"
[OTH],"Now, that's a get-well card!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting."
[OTH],Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?
[OTH],"Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!"
[OTH],"...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about. It's your somewhat substantial police record."
[OTH],"Oh, whatever!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-"
[OTH],"That was not me, that was Mr. Hat!"
[OTH],"All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little ""child molestation"" thing dies down a bit."
[OTH],"Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe."
[OTH],"We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice."
[OTH],Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore. I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun...
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!"
[OTH],"Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?"
[OTH],"Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you."
[OTH],"Hello, sweetie."
[OTH],"Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher. Kyle?"
[OTH],They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
[OTH],"Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look."
[OTH],"Go on, Butters!"
[OTH],"Ho, I don't wanna!"
[OTH],"Butters, go on!"
[OTH],"Oh, uhuh alright, then. We're so sorry you're not feeling well
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune: Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, ""Get well soon!""
And ""Please don't die on us."""
[OTH],"Dude, you really are sick, huh?"
[OTH],"I don't know, I..."
[OTH],"I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous."
[OTH],"Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People."
[OTH],Really? In People?
[OTH],"There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named ""Miss Information."""
[OTH],"Oh, well, with a name like ""Miss Information"" she must know something."
[OTH],Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
[OTH],Okay. I'll get our coats.
[OTH],Can I go now?
[OTH],"I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know."
[OTH],"Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do."
[OTH],I've always wanted to write a novel.
[OTH],"Well, there you go, m'kay?"
[OTH],But I never know what to write about.
[OTH],Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?
[OTH],Besides teaching?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],...Poontang.
[OTH],"M, m'kay"
[OTH],"I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world."
[OTH],"Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel."
[OTH],"Yes, that's it. I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!"
[OTH],"You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins."
[OTH],Toxins?
[OTH],"All the horrible food we eat—the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper."
[OTH],"Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!"
[OTH],"You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all."
[OTH],"Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?"
[OTH],"Don't be a smartass, Stanley."
[OTH],"Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans."
[OTH],"Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually."
[OTH],"Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts
Oh yeah, now this is getting good Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard. His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples Uh, let's see... Diana's nipples... Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck. Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],"Oh my, he looks terrible."
[OTH],"Yes, poor little dear."
[OTH],"Good morning, everyone."
[OTH],"Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse."
[OTH],"Huuuuuuuuuh Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter."
[OTH],"Oh, that's great news!"
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],"Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system."
[OTH],Ooooo.
[OTH],Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
[OTH],"Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!"
[OTH],Don't be a smartass?
[OTH],"Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!"
[OTH],"Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner."
[OTH],I agree. Yeah. That's right.
[OTH],Mr. Marsh is here to see you.
[OTH],"Alright, send him in. Oh, Stanley."
[OTH],"Hi, doctor."
[OTH],How can I help you?
[OTH],"Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick."
[OTH],"He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine."
[OTH],But I don't think it's working.
[OTH],"Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die."
[OTH],Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
[OTH],"I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn."
[OTH],"...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care."
[OTH],"That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact, there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle."
[OTH],"Who? Oh, shit."
[OTH],"(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.)"
Cartman,"""Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew Give me the space cruiser, Kenny."
[OTH],"(No, no.)"
Cartman,"Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5."
[OTH],"(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!) (There! It's mine!)"
Cartman,"No, mine. M'yah! Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha bluh oh, ha-ow!"
[OTH],"Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?"
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you."
Cartman,"Okay, mom."
[OTH],And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS.
Cartman,"What's goin' on, guys?"
[OTH],"Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question."
Cartman,Oh-kay.
[OTH],"Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life."
Cartman,Uh huh.
[OTH],What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
Cartman,"Oh, I think I see where this is going."
[OTH],"His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but it's obviously not working."
Cartman,"Stan, why don't you just ask the question?"
[OTH],Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
Cartman,"No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!"
[OTH],"But you only need one, fat boy!"
Cartman,"'No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!"
[OTH],"Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!"
[OTH],(It's not that's fucking serious.)
Cartman,"Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price."
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],How much?
Cartman,"I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!"
Cartman,"Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars."
[OTH],(Ten million dollars??)
[OTH],"What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!"
Cartman,"What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock."
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here."
Cartman,"Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!"
[OTH],"Oooh, free-range aspirin!"
[OTH],All-natural cell phones!
[OTH],"Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez."
[OTH],Ooo.
[OTH],I'd like to buy some more stuff.
[OTH],"Come in. Come here, guys."
[OTH],Do you have any new holistic items for sale?
[OTH],"Oohh, oh yeah. Aah... Here, uh, this is a- uhh, dream...catcher."
[OTH],"Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one."
[OTH],"Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people."
[OTH],"Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural."
[OTH],Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.
[OTH],"Oh yeah. We love the earth, man."
[OTH],"Oh yeah, the earth is great."
[OTH],Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.
[OTH],"Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'."
[OTH],"uh'hm, ho ho hm."
[OTH],Wonderful!
[OTH],Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit.
[OTH],D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We wanna buy more stuff.
[OTH],"Yes. Much, much more stuff."
[OTH],"Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk. Come on."
[OTH],"Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you."
[OTH],Oh yah. You too and junk.
[OTH],"That's funny, man."
[OTH],"Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste."
[OTH],You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],"Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't."
[OTH],"Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE. Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars."
[OTH],"Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally."
[OTH],Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
[OTH],"You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!"
[OTH],And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
[OTH],"Enough, Stanley!"
[OTH],"Nobody wants to listen, Kenny."
[OTH],(I know.)
[OTH],"I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again."
[OTH],(Uh huh.)
[OTH],"I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do. Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live!"
[OTH],(Rrrh!)
[OTH],"Chapter 18.
Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about. Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!
And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused. ""Go on"", Rebecca said softly, ""Touch me."" Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises. They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with... Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?! Oh, Mr. Hat!"
[OTH],"Come on, where are they?"
[OTH],This is it??
[OTH],(Uh huh)
[OTH],Timmiiihh!
[OTH],This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
[OTH],"Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot."
[OTH],"Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!"
[OTH],"Huh, where are we goin'?"
[OTH],We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney.
[OTH],
[OTH],Mom... Do you ever have those heavy flow days?
[OTH],"Oh absolutely sweetheart, everybody does."
[OTH],"Mom, remember the movie The Shining where the elevator doors are opening up.."
[OTH],Oh honey what you need is a more absorbent tampon.
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],"Well, what's the most absorbent thing in the world?"
[OTH],Well... Cherokee hair I guess. But what does that have to do with me?
[OTH],"Because now there is all new, natural Cherokee hair tampons. ."
[OTH],A cotton tampon can hold only so much liquid. Other tampons also come up short. But Cherokee hair has been known for ages to be strong and powerful Each tampon is hand woven from over 200 strands of Cherokee hair and then bound together with these decorative native beads.
[OTH],You were right mom! All natural Cherokee hair tampons really did the trick.
[OTH],And when you're done using them they make a great toy for Jessie. Go get it boy!
[OTH],Grrr... grrrr
[OTH],"Let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons."
Cartman,No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
[OTH],"Okay, it's clear. Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy."
[OTH],Timmiihh!
[OTH],Sshhh!
[OTH],Timmiihh.
[OTH],"If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?"
[OTH],(Okay)
[OTH],Timmiihh.
[OTH],"Alright Butters, let's go. Uh-oh, Cartman's pig. Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay. Come on, we gotta get outta here! Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Oh well, we're busted."
Cartman,"Shut up, Fluffy!"
[OTH],"Oh, phew."
Cartman,"Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp!"
[OTH],"Okay, here we go. Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here..."
[OTH],I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
[OTH],"...vein right, well- Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up. No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!"
Cartman,"whatwhatwhatwhat? Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!"
[OTH],"You suck, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!"
[OTH],"God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!"
Cartman,I do! I do care! Look how much. Look. Look how much I care.
[OTH],"First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance."
[OTH],"Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, did you read the book?"
[OTH],"Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book."
[OTH],"Well, what did you think?"
[OTH],"Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you."
[OTH],"Ooohhh, why not?"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word ""penis"" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel?"
[OTH],"Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel."
[OTH],"Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a ""romance novel."""
[OTH],No?
[OTH],"No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay."
[OTH],What the hell are you talkin' about?!
[OTH],It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs.
[OTH],"Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!"
[OTH],It is.
[OTH],"Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs! Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!"
[OTH],Hmmm.
[OTH],"There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!"
[OTH],(You never seem to care when I die!)
[OTH],"My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it. Oh, God, he's my best friend..."
[OTH],"(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!)"
[OTH],Look out! Oops.
[OTH],Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again!
[OTH],"Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please."
[OTH],"No problem, man. Pay Miss Information up front."
[OTH],"Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever I watch VH1."
[OTH],"Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice."
[OTH],"Wow, I feel better already!"
[OTH],And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son.
[OTH],"Okay, here he is."
[OTH],"Ahahem, that kid looks really sick."
[OTH],Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.
[OTH],"No. I mean, he looks REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor."
[OTH],Hmm?
[OTH],But you're more in touch with the earth.
[OTH],"Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man."
[OTH],It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing.
[OTH],"No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm- I'm more like a- a Mexican."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],Hu-uh?!
[OTH],Yeah. A Mexican.
[OTH],"Uugh. Ptu, ptu."
[OTH],I didn't know that.
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],How dare you deceive us like that!
[OTH],"Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that."
[OTH],Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans.
[OTH],"Uh, toxins are your enemy."
[OTH],Kill her!
[OTH],Funny.
[OTH],So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
[OTH],"Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!"
[OTH],"That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan."
Cartman,"Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA! That son of a bitch!"
Cartman,"Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!"
[OTH],"Dude, please. Kyle needs it."
Cartman,"It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!"
[OTH],"Alright, alright, here."
Cartman,"Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before."
[OTH],"Doctor, Eric Cartman is here-"
[OTH],"Why, hello there, Eric."
Cartman,"You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in! Please."
[OTH],"Oh, I see. Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?"
Cartman,"No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!"
[OTH],"Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery. If you'll just sign this release."
Cartman,Thank you.
[OTH],"How are you feeling, boubbie?"
[OTH],"Better, thanks."
[OTH],You look a lot better.
[OTH],"Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick."
[OTH],"Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan."
[OTH],"Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do."
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too."
Cartman,"Heh. Hey, what what's going on?"
[OTH],"Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!"
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney."
[OTH],"Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release."
[OTH],"Isn't that funny, sweetie?"
Cartman,Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
[OTH],"Oh, here's everybody."
[OTH],"Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?"
[OTH],"Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present."
[OTH],Oh. ...Thanks?
Cartman,I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
[OTH],"Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches."
[OTH],Huh? What the?
Cartman,"Oh good, you got the crappy kidney."
[OTH],"Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?"
[OTH],"Mayor, it's about the South Park flag."
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!"
[OTH],"We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!"
[OTH],"Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!"
[OTH],"Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!"
[OTH],That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!
[OTH],"Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag. and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it."
[OTH],You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
[OTH],"Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"No, because it's their history!"
[OTH],"Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!"
[OTH],And I'm telling you it WON'T!
[OTH],"Oh, boy."
[OTH],"Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club."
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],"I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year. Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been... Cartman."
Cartman,Thaaat's ri-ight.
[OTH],Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
[OTH],You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
Cartman,"Yes, I do!"
[OTH],"No, you don't!"
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home!"
[OTH],Told ya.
[OTH],"Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on."
[OTH],"This is about history, kids. If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD! -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not ""politically correct."" Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL! And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?"
[OTH],"Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains-"
[OTH],"Uh... that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it."
[OTH],"Yeah, we got it."
[OTH],You sure?
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],"You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson! God-damnit, we missed him again!"
[OTH],"Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag! You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved! Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?"
[OTH],"Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag."
[OTH],"Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion. That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!"
[OTH],"We'll march with you, Chef."
[OTH],"That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters. Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?"
[OTH],"Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon."
[OTH],"Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?"
[OTH],"Thursday's no good, we've got choir council."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],What about next Sunday?
[OTH],Fine! Next Sunday!
[OTH],"You mean, during the ball game?"
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday."
[OTH],Monday??
[OTH],"Oh, I can't do Monday."
[OTH],I could do Tuesday.
[OTH],"Yeah, Tuesday morning's good."
[OTH],You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
[OTH],Saturday is perfect for me.
[OTH],Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?
[OTH],Mm hmm.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],That sounds good.
[OTH],Mm hmm.
[OTH],"Yeah, I think that's the best day."
[OTH],"Okay! On Saturday, we march!"
[OTH],"Oh, march? What are we marching for?"
[OTH],To bring down the South Park Flag!
[OTH],…Oh.
[OTH],"Oohh, I gotta go."
[OTH],I know what I may like. I don't like marching.
[OTH],"Uh, marching's really not for me."
[OTH],See you later.
[OTH],"Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed."
[OTH],How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
[OTH],"Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the ""Flag Should Stay The Way It Is"" team?"
[OTH],Me. Me. Me. Me.
[OTH],Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag."
[OTH],"Yeah, me neither."
[OTH],"Alright. Stan and Kyle, you can both be the team leaders for the ""Flag should stay the way it is"" team. Now, who wants to lead the ""Flag should be changed"" team? Okay, Wendy and Eric can team up."
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],"Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!"
[OTH],"Hello, Chef."
[OTH],"My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam."
[OTH],Islam??
[OTH],"From now on, my name is Abdul Mohammed Jabar Rauf Kareem Ali. With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!"
[OTH],"Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed."
[OTH],You WHAT?! You don't think they should change the flag?!
[OTH],Not really.
[OTH],"Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is."
[OTH],"Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!"
[OTH],"But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about, it's--"
[OTH],"But nothin'! ""But"" my ass! Fix your own damn food!"
[OTH],"Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-"
Cartman,"It's okay, I'm here."
[OTH],Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
Cartman,"Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility."
[OTH],What??
Cartman,"That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility! Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever."
[OTH],Wwuhuh-o-kay!
Cartman,"The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy."
[OTH],Right.
Cartman,Mmmm.
[OTH],"Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate."
Cartman,"You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?"
[OTH],The South Park flag!
Cartman,"Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?"
[OTH],D'aaaaahhh!
Cartman,"Whoa! Calm down, ho."
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered."
[OTH],Change the flag!
[OTH],Don't change history!
[OTH],"Oh brother, what now?!"
[OTH],Change the flag! Change the flag!…
[OTH],"Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced their opinion."
[OTH],"Well, I think the flag is racist! Huh, but then again, it is part of our history."
[OTH],"Well, I guess the flag is part of history, …but I can see how it is racist."
[OTH],I think it is history. I think it is racist.
[OTH],"Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something."
[OTH],"…Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! In the 1960s there was a monk who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice! To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing!"
[OTH],Huh! Haaaaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to express their opinion."
[OTH],"Hello, brother. We are here to support your noble cause."
[OTH],"Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, whether you want our support or not, we're on your side!"
[OTH],White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?!"
[OTH],"NO, no, but Mr. Hat is."
[OTH],White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],White Power!
[OTH],Change the flag!
[OTH],Don't change history!
[OTH],"Ooh, Jesus. What a mess."
[OTH],"Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case. We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen? There. Is that better?"
[OTH],"No, damnit!"
[OTH],"No, but look! He's got a little smile now! See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think? Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?"
[OTH],"Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday."
[OTH],We… could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.
[OTH],"Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!"
[OTH],"This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-"
Cartman,"I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!"
[OTH],If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
Cartman,Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
[OTH],"Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!"
Cartman,You won't let me help.
[OTH],"That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!"
Cartman,"…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it. Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih. Wendih. Seriouslih. The Bog Monster speaketh."
[OTH],"Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want. Who wants to read them?"
[OTH],"Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!"
[OTH],"Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!"
[OTH],(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)
[OTH],"I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner."
[OTH],"(Ah, fuck you!)"
[OTH],"I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side."
[OTH],"Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend."
[OTH],"(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)"
[OTH],"Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there."
[OTH],"Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints."
[OTH],"Hey, boys, how's the research coming?"
[OTH],"Pretty good, I guess."
[OTH],Do you think they should change the flag?
[OTH],"Oh, uuhh. I don't know."
[OTH],"Kenny ate all the mints, dad."
[OTH],"Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Kenny!
[OTH],(What?) (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!)
[OTH],That was a good one.
[OTH],White Power! White Power!
[OTH],Do not change the flag! It is a symbol of white power!
[OTH],White Power!
[OTH],"Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch."
[OTH],Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker!
[OTH],Dugh! Ogh. Waaaaah!
[OTH],How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!
[OTH],"Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking."
[OTH],Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think.
[OTH],"Well, I think they are racist, but I… do think freedom of speech is important."
[OTH],"Well, I, for one, believe in freedom of speech. …Mmm but then again, I think they are racist."
[OTH],"Well, I believe that they are racist, but I do believe that all-"
[OTH],"Aw, to hell with all of you indecisive bastards!"
[OTH],"On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. Z So the pressure in on those South Park kids!"
[OTH],"Well, that's enough rallying for this afternoon, members. Let's take a hot shower!"
[OTH],Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower!
[OTH],"Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them."
[OTH],"I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote."
Cartman,Uh huh.
[OTH],"Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument."
Cartman,Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it."
[OTH],"Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman."
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument.
Cartman,Cool.
[OTH],Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite.
Cartman,"Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs."""
[OTH],"Hey, that's what I always do, too!"
Cartman,No way!
[OTH],"Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman."
Cartman,Me neither.
[OTH],Aha ha.
Cartman,Huh.
Cartman,"Well, anyway, let's get back to work."
Cartman,Whoa.
[OTH],"Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag. We can show that the-"
Cartman,"Ur, s-sorry. Go ahead."
[OTH],No. You go ahead.
[OTH],"Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?"
[OTH],There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
[OTH],"Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting."
[OTH],But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
[OTH],"Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!"
[OTH],I'm going whether you like it or not!
[OTH],"Oh yeah?! I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final! Let's just see you try and go without me! Mi-Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with."
[OTH],Mmm-okay.
[OTH],"Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"Good evening, brothers. Our first order of business tonight is to have Brother Anderson update us on last week's minutes."
[OTH],Last week we decided we hate blacks and Jews. A lot!
[OTH],"Alright. And now it's time for us all to come together, and… do our cake raffle."
[OTH],"Oh, cake raffle."
[OTH],"This week's winner is… uh, 2 9 7 4."
[OTH],"I won, I won. I won the cake!"
[OTH],"God job, brother."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,Ahh!
[OTH],Say it'll be like this forever.
Cartman,"Okay, It will be like this forever."
[OTH],"Oh, Cartman!"
[OTH],"AAAAAAaaaah! Brrrrr. What's wrong with me? Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl."
Cartman,Wendih. Wendih.
[OTH],Aaaah!
Cartman,"Wendih, look at me."
[OTH],"Oh God, please don't let this be happening."
[OTH],"Alright brothers, listen up! As you know, this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag. But lynching minorities is history! So what are we gonna do about it?!"
[OTH],"Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll burn down the Capitol!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll never leave this town!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Let's say they should change the flag!
[OTH],Yeah! Wah?
[OTH],"Uh what's that, brother?"
[OTH],I think we should switch sides!
[OTH],Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea.
[OTH],"Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?"
[OTH],"Yeah, m-hm."
[OTH],"So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?"
[OTH],"Right, yeah."
[OTH],"So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is."
[OTH],"That's a great idea, brother!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, it is decided! We will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed, so that they will all vote against us!"
[OTH],"Hooray, yeah!"
[OTH],We're smart!
[OTH],"That worked perfectly, Ned."
[OTH],"Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, ""Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?"""
[OTH],"Yeah, woohoo!"
[OTH],"Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts."
[OTH],Mm-yup.
[OTH],"That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy? Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess. Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!"
[OTH],I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass!
[OTH],"Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes."
[OTH],"Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you."
[OTH],"Sure, what?"
[OTH],"Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman."
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
[OTH],"Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-"
[OTH],"Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, ""sexual tension."" Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with."
[OTH],"You mean, I should kiss him?"
[OTH],Kiss him and get it out of your system.
[OTH],Oh God.
[OTH],"Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club. I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the ""Flag Should Be Changed"" team."
[OTH],"The- the- uh, aheh ahum, the… the- uh, Ahhhhh, The first argument we- ah… Let me start over. The uh- oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment? Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee..."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Oh, God!"
[OTH],"There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you."
[OTH],"Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point?"
[OTH],"Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill. And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing."
[OTH],Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!"
[OTH],Racist??
[OTH],"Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people."
[OTH],Ooooooohhh.
[OTH],Ooooooohhh?!
[OTH],W-we really didn't see it that way.
[OTH],But that's a black man up there!
[OTH],"Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter."
[OTH],"Well of course it matters when- …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist."
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef."
[OTH],"Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man."
[OTH],"We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with."
[OTH],I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
[OTH],"Ooh, huhuh. Oooh"
[OTH],"Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now. Stan?"
[OTH],"This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week. Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag!"
[OTH],"Wait, I don't get it."
[OTH],"No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer."
[OTH],Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
Cartman,"Me, too!"
[OTH],"I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished."
Cartman,"Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh."
[OTH],I'm totally back to normal. See you later.
Cartman,"Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho, huhuh, he, haha."
[OTH],"Hahaha. Stan. Stan, wait up!"
[OTH],"Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?"
[OTH],"Mayor, it's about the South Park flag."
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!"
[OTH],"We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!"
[OTH],"Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!"
[OTH],"Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!"
[OTH],That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!
[OTH],"Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag. and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it."
[OTH],You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
[OTH],"Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"No, because it's their history!"
[OTH],"Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!"
[OTH],And I'm telling you it WON'T!
[OTH],"Oh, boy."
[OTH],"Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club."
[OTH],Aaaaah!
[OTH],"I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year. Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been... Cartman."
Cartman,Thaaat's ri-ight.
[OTH],Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
[OTH],You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
Cartman,"Yes, I do!"
[OTH],"No, you don't!"
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home!"
[OTH],Told ya.
[OTH],"Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on."
[OTH],"This is about history, kids. If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD! -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not ""politically correct."" Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL! And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?"
[OTH],"Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains-"
[OTH],"Uh... that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it."
[OTH],"Yeah, we got it."
[OTH],You sure?
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],"You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson! God-damnit, we missed him again!"
[OTH],"Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag! You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved! Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?"
[OTH],"Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag."
[OTH],"Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion. That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!"
[OTH],"We'll march with you, Chef."
[OTH],"That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters. Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?"
[OTH],"Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon."
[OTH],"Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?"
[OTH],"Thursday's no good, we've got choir council."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],What about next Sunday?
[OTH],Fine! Next Sunday!
[OTH],"You mean, during the ball game?"
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday."
[OTH],Monday??
[OTH],"Oh, I can't do Monday."
[OTH],I could do Tuesday.
[OTH],"Yeah, Tuesday morning's good."
[OTH],You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
[OTH],Saturday is perfect for me.
[OTH],Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?
[OTH],Mm hmm.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],That sounds good.
[OTH],Mm hmm.
[OTH],"Yeah, I think that's the best day."
[OTH],"Okay! On Saturday, we march!"
[OTH],"Oh, march? What are we marching for?"
[OTH],To bring down the South Park Flag!
[OTH],…Oh.
[OTH],"Oohh, I gotta go."
[OTH],I know what I may like. I don't like marching.
[OTH],"Uh, marching's really not for me."
[OTH],See you later.
[OTH],"Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed."
[OTH],How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
[OTH],"Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the ""Flag Should Stay The Way It Is"" team?"
[OTH],Me. Me. Me. Me.
[OTH],Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag."
[OTH],"Yeah, me neither."
[OTH],"Alright. Stan and Kyle, you can both be the team leaders for the ""Flag should stay the way it is"" team. Now, who wants to lead the ""Flag should be changed"" team? Okay, Wendy and Eric can team up."
[OTH],Nooo!
[OTH],"Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!"
[OTH],"Hello, Chef."
[OTH],"My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam."
[OTH],Islam??
[OTH],"From now on, my name is Abdul Mohammed Jabar Rauf Kareem Ali. With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!"
[OTH],"Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed."
[OTH],You WHAT?! You don't think they should change the flag?!
[OTH],Not really.
[OTH],"Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is."
[OTH],"Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!"
[OTH],"But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about, it's--"
[OTH],"But nothin'! ""But"" my ass! Fix your own damn food!"
[OTH],"Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-"
Cartman,"It's okay, I'm here."
[OTH],Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
Cartman,"Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility."
[OTH],What??
Cartman,"That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility! Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever."
[OTH],Wwuhuh-o-kay!
Cartman,"The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy."
[OTH],Right.
Cartman,Mmmm.
[OTH],"Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate."
Cartman,"You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?"
[OTH],The South Park flag!
Cartman,"Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?"
[OTH],D'aaaaahhh!
Cartman,"Whoa! Calm down, ho."
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered."
[OTH],Change the flag!
[OTH],Don't change history!
[OTH],"Oh brother, what now?!"
[OTH],Change the flag! Change the flag!…
[OTH],"Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced their opinion."
[OTH],"Well, I think the flag is racist! Huh, but then again, it is part of our history."
[OTH],"Well, I guess the flag is part of history, …but I can see how it is racist."
[OTH],I think it is history. I think it is racist.
[OTH],"Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something."
[OTH],"…Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! In the 1960s there was a monk who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice! To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing!"
[OTH],Huh! Haaaaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to express their opinion."
[OTH],"Hello, brother. We are here to support your noble cause."
[OTH],"Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Well, whether you want our support or not, we're on your side!"
[OTH],White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?!"
[OTH],"NO, no, but Mr. Hat is."
[OTH],White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat."
[OTH],White Power!
[OTH],Change the flag!
[OTH],Don't change history!
[OTH],"Ooh, Jesus. What a mess."
[OTH],"Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case. We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen? There. Is that better?"
[OTH],"No, damnit!"
[OTH],"No, but look! He's got a little smile now! See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think? Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?"
[OTH],"Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday."
[OTH],We… could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.
[OTH],"Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!"
[OTH],"This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-"
Cartman,"I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!"
[OTH],If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
Cartman,Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
[OTH],"Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!"
Cartman,You won't let me help.
[OTH],"That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!"
Cartman,"…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it. Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih. Wendih. Seriouslih. The Bog Monster speaketh."
[OTH],"Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want. Who wants to read them?"
[OTH],"Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!"
[OTH],"Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!"
[OTH],(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)
[OTH],"I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner."
[OTH],"(Ah, fuck you!)"
[OTH],"I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side."
[OTH],"Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend."
[OTH],"(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)"
[OTH],"Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there."
[OTH],"Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints."
[OTH],"Hey, boys, how's the research coming?"
[OTH],"Pretty good, I guess."
[OTH],Do you think they should change the flag?
[OTH],"Oh, uuhh. I don't know."
[OTH],"Kenny ate all the mints, dad."
[OTH],"Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Kenny!
[OTH],(What?) (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!)
[OTH],That was a good one.
[OTH],White Power! White Power!
[OTH],Do not change the flag! It is a symbol of white power!
[OTH],White Power!
[OTH],"Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch."
[OTH],Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker!
[OTH],Dugh! Ogh. Waaaaah!
[OTH],How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!
[OTH],"Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking."
[OTH],Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think.
[OTH],"Well, I think they are racist, but I… do think freedom of speech is important."
[OTH],"Well, I, for one, believe in freedom of speech. …Mmm but then again, I think they are racist."
[OTH],"Well, I believe that they are racist, but I do believe that all-"
[OTH],"Aw, to hell with all of you indecisive bastards!"
[OTH],"On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. Z So the pressure in on those South Park kids!"
[OTH],"Well, that's enough rallying for this afternoon, members. Let's take a hot shower!"
[OTH],Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower!
[OTH],"Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them."
[OTH],"I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote."
Cartman,Uh huh.
[OTH],"Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument."
Cartman,Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it."
[OTH],"Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman."
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument.
Cartman,Cool.
[OTH],Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite.
Cartman,"Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs."""
[OTH],"Hey, that's what I always do, too!"
Cartman,No way!
[OTH],"Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman."
Cartman,Me neither.
[OTH],Aha ha.
Cartman,Huh.
Cartman,"Well, anyway, let's get back to work."
Cartman,Whoa.
[OTH],"Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag. We can show that the-"
Cartman,"Ur, s-sorry. Go ahead."
[OTH],No. You go ahead.
[OTH],"Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?"
[OTH],There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
[OTH],"Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting."
[OTH],But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
[OTH],"Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!"
[OTH],I'm going whether you like it or not!
[OTH],"Oh yeah?! I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final! Let's just see you try and go without me! Mi-Mr. Hat?"
[OTH],White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with."
[OTH],Mmm-okay.
[OTH],"Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],White Power! White Power!
[OTH],"Good evening, brothers. Our first order of business tonight is to have Brother Anderson update us on last week's minutes."
[OTH],Last week we decided we hate blacks and Jews. A lot!
[OTH],"Alright. And now it's time for us all to come together, and… do our cake raffle."
[OTH],"Oh, cake raffle."
[OTH],"This week's winner is… uh, 2 9 7 4."
[OTH],"I won, I won. I won the cake!"
[OTH],"God job, brother."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,Ahh!
[OTH],Say it'll be like this forever.
Cartman,"Okay, It will be like this forever."
[OTH],"Oh, Cartman!"
[OTH],"AAAAAAaaaah! Brrrrr. What's wrong with me? Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl."
Cartman,Wendih. Wendih.
[OTH],Aaaah!
Cartman,"Wendih, look at me."
[OTH],"Oh God, please don't let this be happening."
[OTH],"Alright brothers, listen up! As you know, this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag. But lynching minorities is history! So what are we gonna do about it?!"
[OTH],"Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll burn down the Capitol!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll never leave this town!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Let's say they should change the flag!
[OTH],Yeah! Wah?
[OTH],"Uh what's that, brother?"
[OTH],I think we should switch sides!
[OTH],Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea.
[OTH],"Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?"
[OTH],"Yeah, m-hm."
[OTH],"So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?"
[OTH],"Right, yeah."
[OTH],"So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is."
[OTH],"That's a great idea, brother!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Alright, it is decided! We will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed, so that they will all vote against us!"
[OTH],"Hooray, yeah!"
[OTH],We're smart!
[OTH],"That worked perfectly, Ned."
[OTH],"Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, ""Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?"""
[OTH],"Yeah, woohoo!"
[OTH],"Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts."
[OTH],Mm-yup.
[OTH],"That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy? Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess. Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!"
[OTH],I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass!
[OTH],"Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes."
[OTH],"Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you."
[OTH],"Sure, what?"
[OTH],"Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman."
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
[OTH],"Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-"
[OTH],"Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, ""sexual tension."" Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with."
[OTH],"You mean, I should kiss him?"
[OTH],Kiss him and get it out of your system.
[OTH],Oh God.
[OTH],"Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club. I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the ""Flag Should Be Changed"" team."
[OTH],"The- the- uh, aheh ahum, the… the- uh, Ahhhhh, The first argument we- ah… Let me start over. The uh- oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment? Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee..."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Oh, God!"
[OTH],"There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you."
[OTH],"Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point?"
[OTH],"Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill. And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing."
[OTH],Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!"
[OTH],Racist??
[OTH],"Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people."
[OTH],Ooooooohhh.
[OTH],Ooooooohhh?!
[OTH],W-we really didn't see it that way.
[OTH],But that's a black man up there!
[OTH],"Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter."
[OTH],"Well of course it matters when- …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist."
[OTH],"Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef."
[OTH],"Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man."
[OTH],"We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with."
[OTH],I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
[OTH],"Ooh, huhuh. Oooh"
[OTH],"Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now. Stan?"
[OTH],"This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week. Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag!"
[OTH],"Wait, I don't get it."
[OTH],"No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist."
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer."
[OTH],Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
Cartman,"Me, too!"
[OTH],"I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished."
Cartman,"Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh."
[OTH],I'm totally back to normal. See you later.
Cartman,"Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho, huhuh, he, haha."
[OTH],"Hahaha. Stan. Stan, wait up!"
[OTH],"Tonight, Stellar Productions presents the boy band of the decade! It's Fingerbang, live from Madison Square Gardens!"
[OTH],"Fingerbang! Bang-bang!
Fingerbang-bang! Bangbangbang! I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you ever-y night"
Cartman,"And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl"
[OTH],"Cartman, I want youuu!"
Cartman,My... girrrrrrrl...

Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang!
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang--"
Cartman,"Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm-- Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-dammit! Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million, don't you? That's it!"
Cartman,"Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives. God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million."
[OTH],...How?
Cartman,Boy band.
[OTH],Boy band?
Cartman,Boy band.
[OTH],I'm not being in any faggy boy band!
Cartman,"There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God!"
[OTH],"Dude, we don't have any musical talent."
Cartman,"That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass! I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!"
[OTH],(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
Cartman,"Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall. So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--"
[OTH],Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
Cartman,So?
[OTH],"So, all boy bands have five members."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members."
[OTH],He's right.
Cartman,"Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!"
[OTH],"Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?"
[OTH],"Well, I guess."
[OTH],What did you do?
[OTH],"Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall."
[OTH],"Oh well, that sounds nice."
[OTH],"No, it does NOT sound nice! Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band."
[OTH],"Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it."
[OTH],"If all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you do that too?"
[OTH],Cartman says we can make $10 million.
[OTH],"You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL!"
[OTH],"Geez, what's up Dad's ass?"
[OTH],"Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head Down came a white angel and she said ""Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head""

[OTH],"Ah, I can do it again."
Cartman,"We'll let you know, Butters."
[OTH],"Ahah-oo well, alright then."
Cartman,"Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!"
[OTH],It was?
[OTH],"Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that."
Cartman,"Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better do it better than that. Next!"
[OTH],"Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski."
Cartman,Kyle's brother?
[OTH],I promised my mom I'd let him try.
Cartman,Christ's sake..!
[OTH],What key?
[OTH],"G. Itsy bitsy spider, out the water spout--"

Cartman,"'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough."
[OTH],I wanna be the tough one.
Cartman,"...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--"
[OTH],I wanna be the tough one!
Cartman,You can't be the tough one because you're Jewish!
[OTH],Jews are tough!
Cartman,Since when?!
[OTH],"Since Abraham, fatass!"
Cartman,"Alright, fine! Here! Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this!"
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?"
Cartman,"I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you... pretend to use your finger like a gun or something."
[OTH],"(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)"
[OTH],Kenny says that's not what it means.
Cartman,"Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then?"
[OTH],"(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)"
Cartman,"...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!"
[OTH],"Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous."
Cartman,"Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!"
[OTH],"Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?"
Cartman,We're goin' to see the mall manager.
[OTH],Do you have the proper clearance?
[OTH],"Uh oh, mall cops."
[OTH],"You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir."
Cartman,"But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do, so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the-- Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-dammit..!"
[OTH],Jesus Christ!
Cartman,"Oh, God, I can't see!"
[OTH],"Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again. You see, you put your life on the line every day."
[OTH],"Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager."
Cartman,The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on!
[OTH],Ey! What are you doin'?
[OTH],Nothin'. Just... shopping.
[OTH],"Move along, sir. You see, sometimes you gotta just do that. Keeps shoppers on their toes — try it."
[OTH],Ey! What are you doin'?
[OTH],Nothing. Why?
[OTH],"Move along, ma'am."
[OTH],That's what being a mall cop is all about. Hyeuup.
[OTH],Cool.
Cartman,Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up.
[OTH],"Jesus, they're gonna start a riot!"
Cartman,"Alright, guys, here we go. Hello, sir!"
[OTH],What? Hey. Who are you?
Cartman,We... are Fingerbang!
[OTH],O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
Cartman,We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
[OTH],What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
Cartman,"Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?"
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?"
Cartman,"Alright! Let's do it, boys!"
[OTH],"I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
I'm goin' to fingerbang-bang you ever-y night"
Cartman,"And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--"
[OTH],"Alright, that's enough!"
Cartman,"--you're my fantasy, you fanta--"
[OTH],Thank you.
Cartman,"Well, so can we play here?"
[OTH],What?? ...No.
Cartman,No??
[OTH],Who?? No!
Cartman,Why not?!
[OTH],"Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?"
Cartman,"You don't think we're any good, do you?!"
[OTH],"No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese."
Cartman,"Well, come on guys. We gave it our best."
[OTH],Wow. That was your best?
[OTH],Wow. I feel so rejected.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],There you are! You're the hoodlums who got on the intercom and started an orange smoothie riot!
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--
[OTH],Run for it!
[OTH],"Go get 'em, rookie!"
[OTH],Where is Stan?
[OTH],"Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band."
[OTH],What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
[OTH],"Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it."
[OTH],"And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?!"
[OTH],"Mom, what's up Dad's ass?"
[OTH],"It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now."
[OTH],"Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric."
Cartman,"Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems."
[OTH],"Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out."
Cartman,I just don't know what I'm gonna do. Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me.
[OTH],"Alright, Eric, what's the matter?"
Cartman,"Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean, I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know?"
[OTH],"Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect."
Cartman,What's the Gomlich effect?
[OTH],"The law of physics that states, ""If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."""
Cartman,So how do boy bands use that?
[OTH],"All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy! Uh-uh, except for Lillith, of course."
Cartman,Thanks!
[OTH],"You're welcome. Now, go away!"
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
Cartman,Cucumber in the pants. Got it.
Cartman,"Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?"
[OTH],"Are we gonna get paid now, or after?"
Cartman,"I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera."
[OTH],Tiimmmaaayyy!
[OTH],"Dude, what's wrong with your leg?"
Cartman,"Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck."
[OTH],Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.
Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!"
[OTH],Huhaaaaah!
Cartman,"Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!"
[OTH],We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
[OTH],...Matt Lauer.
Cartman,"...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer."
[OTH],Oh... Okay.
Cartman,Roll camera!
[OTH],Timmuh!
[OTH],AAAGGGGHHH!
Cartman,Jesus Christ!
[OTH],Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
Cartman,"Aaand cut! Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!"
[OTH],"Okay, so where's our money?"
Cartman,"Oh uh, Kyle has it."
[OTH],"Stanley, what the hell are you doing?"
[OTH],We are making a music video.
[OTH],You get in the truck right now!
[OTH],"Dad, I was just a--"
[OTH],Get in the truck!
[OTH],"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?"
[OTH],"Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed."
[OTH],"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting."
[OTH],"Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well, maybe it's time."
[OTH],Dad!
[OTH],Ey! What are you doin'?
[OTH],I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!
[OTH],"Move along, sir."
[OTH],Wuh?
Cartman,"Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine."
[OTH],God dammit!
Cartman,Hello again!
[OTH],What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
Cartman,I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
[OTH],Oh. What?
Cartman,"If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed!"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
Cartman,"Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool."
[OTH],"Haaghh. Timmih, livin' a lie!"
Cartman,Son of a bitch!
[OTH],Hey. This video is dumb.
Cartman,You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
[OTH],"Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side. For a little while."
Cartman,Really? You will?
[OTH],"Only for twenty minutes, though."
Cartman,That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
[OTH],Oh. Okay.
Cartman,"Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed!"
[OTH],"Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay?"
[OTH],"You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay?"
Cartman,"Aw, Mom!"
[OTH],Wow. What?
[OTH],"It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?"
[OTH],Because I said so!
[OTH],"Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me."
[OTH],"Let 'em be pissed off, then!"
[OTH],"I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--"
[OTH],No!! NOOO!!
[OTH],Dad? What the hell is going on?
[OTH],...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver. I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience.
[OTH],"Kid, can I talk to you?"
[OTH],Uh sure.
[OTH],"Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town."
[OTH],"Ohh, thanks."
[OTH],Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
[OTH],What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
[OTH],"Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?"
[OTH],"Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--"
[OTH],"Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--"
[OTH],"No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it."
[OTH],I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning.
[OTH],And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],...And I left my family.
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],"And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know."
[OTH],Take 112!
[OTH],"You've... got... it!
You know you've got... it What you've got is it!"
[OTH],"It's obvious to me, girl"
[OTH],"The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world."
[OTH],"Shirl! You've... got... it!
It... is what you've got, girl!
What you've got is it!"
[OTH],"Now, give it to me, 'cause..."
[OTH],"I had everything. A huge house, and all the women you can imagine. And then one day, just as quick as it started..."
[OTH],"Alright, guys, let's take it from the top."
[OTH],"Hey, Mr. Allens."
[OTH],Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.
[OTH],Who are they?
[OTH],"These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band."
[OTH],"But, w-we're still selling records, right?"
[OTH],"Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band."
[OTH],I'm 19.
[OTH],"Get a life, Marsh! Alright, guys, let's take it from the top."
[OTH],"They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car..."
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],...the women all left...
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],...and they took back my house.
[OTH],Ugh..!
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],"The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned."
[OTH],"Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?"
[OTH],"Sure, I remember you! You got it, baby... You got it, baby"
[OTH],"And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about."
[OTH],Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
[OTH],"I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world. That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley. It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall."
[OTH],...Oh-kay.
[OTH],Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there.
Cartman,Where the hell is Stan?!
[OTH],He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
Cartman,"I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!"
[OTH],"Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?"
Cartman,"Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member."
[OTH],Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer.
Cartman,Yeah. We'll start right away. We'll have to do it without him.
[OTH],Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
[OTH],(Yeah!)
Cartman,"Oh, god-dammit!"
[OTH],Dad?
[OTH],Huh? Yeah?
[OTH],"Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had."
[OTH],"Come here, Stanley. Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?"
[OTH],Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
[OTH],"Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],What's happening here?
[OTH],"I don't know, uh. I guess nothing."
[OTH],"Hm... Well, let's just walk away then."
Cartman,God dammit! People are walking away!
[OTH],"Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart."
Cartman,Just another minute.
[OTH],Sorry. Get out!
Cartman,"Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],It's Stan!
Cartman,"Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name!"
[OTH],"Dude, where the hell have you been?!"
Cartman,"Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?"
[OTH],"Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up."
Cartman,"We will! Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall."" And so, without further ado, all five members of the..."
[OTH],(Uff--!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
Cartman,No! He can't be dead!
[OTH],"Dude, he's pretty dead."
Cartman,No! We were so close!
[OTH],"Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!"
Cartman,But we have to perform!
[OTH],"We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Oh, yes we do."
Cartman,"Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!"
[OTH],"Fingerbang!
Bang bang Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright 'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night!"
Cartman,"Chuh! Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!"
[OTH],We made two dollars.
[OTH],"You were great, Dad."
[OTH],Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
[OTH],Can I get your autograph?
Cartman,"Ok-Okay, okay."
[OTH],"Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am."
[OTH],"I actually don't really know who they are, I was just getting an autograph and-- A-a-agg-g-ggh!"
[OTH],"Move along, ma'am. Eh, that was pretty good, kids. Maybe you can come perform at my Elks Club sometime."
Cartman,"Okay, yeah, maybe. God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"""
[OTH],...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
[OTH],Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
[OTH],"Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie."
[OTH],I don't think they sell those anymore.
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million?"
Cartman,"Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy. You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah."
[OTH],"Tonight, Stellar Productions presents the boy band of the decade! It's Fingerbang, live from Madison Square Gardens!"
[OTH],"Fingerbang! Bang-bang!
Fingerbang-bang! Bangbangbang! I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you ever-y night"
Cartman,"And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl"
[OTH],"Cartman, I want youuu!"
Cartman,My... girrrrrrrl...
[OTH],"Fingerbang!
Bang... Bang bang bang
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang!
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang--"
Cartman,"Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm-- Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-dammit! Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million, don't you? That's it!"
Cartman,"Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives. God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million."
[OTH],...How?
Cartman,Boy band.
[OTH],Boy band?
Cartman,Boy band.
[OTH],I'm not being in any faggy boy band!
Cartman,"There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God!"
[OTH],"Dude, we don't have any musical talent."
Cartman,"That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass! I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!"
[OTH],(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
Cartman,"Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall. So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--"
[OTH],Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
Cartman,So?
[OTH],"So, all boy bands have five members."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members."
[OTH],He's right.
Cartman,"Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!"
[OTH],"Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?"
[OTH],"Well, I guess."
[OTH],What did you do?
[OTH],"Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall."
[OTH],"Oh well, that sounds nice."
[OTH],"No, it does NOT sound nice! Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band."
[OTH],"Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it."
[OTH],"If all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you do that too?"
[OTH],Cartman says we can make $10 million.
[OTH],"You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL!"
[OTH],"Geez, what's up Dad's ass?"
[OTH],"Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head Down came a white angel and she said ""Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head""
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest

Cartman,"Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know."
[OTH],"Ah, I can do it again."
Cartman,"We'll let you know, Butters."
[OTH],"Ahah-oo well, alright then."
Cartman,"Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!"
[OTH],It was?
[OTH],"Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that."
Cartman,"Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better do it better than that. Next!"
[OTH],"Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski."
Cartman,Kyle's brother?
[OTH],I promised my mom I'd let him try.
Cartman,Christ's sake..!
[OTH],What key?
[OTH],"G. Itsy bitsy spider, out the water spout--"
Cartman,Next!
[OTH],"Oh Danny Boy, the parson's callingClang, clang and clang"
Cartman,Next audition!
[OTH],"E F G, H I J K L-M-N-O-P"
Cartman,"Goddammit, NEXT!"
[OTH],"One on a teacher on a palm tree""G-U-B, When the teacher wanna punch me"""
Cartman,"Not the next song, the next PERSON! Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryout's for a boy band!"
[OTH],"Aw, come on, dude. Let her try."
Cartman,No way!

Cartman,"Dude, she's a chick!"

Cartman,"""Nobody's gonna notice""?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?!"
[OTH],She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],(Me too.)
Cartman,"Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!"
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
[OTH],"Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?"
Cartman,"We have to rehearse all that we can! Now, check this out: My mom made us costumes!"
[OTH],Costumes?
Cartman,"Yeah. This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters..."
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?"
Cartman,"'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough."
[OTH],I wanna be the tough one.
Cartman,"...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--"
[OTH],I wanna be the tough one!
Cartman,You can't be the tough one because you're Jewish!

Cartman,Since when?!

Cartman,"Alright, fine! Here! Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this!"
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?"
Cartman,"I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you... pretend to use your finger like a gun or something."
[OTH],"(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)"
[OTH],Kenny says that's not what it means.
Cartman,"Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then?"
[OTH],"(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)"
Cartman,"...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!"
[OTH],"Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous."
Cartman,"Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!"
[OTH],"Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?"
Cartman,We're goin' to see the mall manager.
[OTH],Do you have the proper clearance?
[OTH],"Uh oh, mall cops."
[OTH],"You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir."
Cartman,"But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do, so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the-- Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-dammit..!"
[OTH],Jesus Christ!
Cartman,"Oh, God, I can't see!"
[OTH],"Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again. You see, you put your life on the line every day."
[OTH],"Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager."
Cartman,The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on!
[OTH],Ey! What are you doin'?
[OTH],Nothin'. Just... shopping.
[OTH],"Move along, sir. You see, sometimes you gotta just do that. Keeps shoppers on their toes — try it."
[OTH],Ey! What are you doin'?
[OTH],Nothing. Why?
[OTH],"Move along, ma'am."
[OTH],That's what being a mall cop is all about. Hyeuup.
[OTH],Cool.
Cartman,Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up.
[OTH],"Jesus, they're gonna start a riot!"
Cartman,"Alright, guys, here we go. Hello, sir!"
[OTH],What? Hey. Who are you?
Cartman,We... are Fingerbang!
[OTH],O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
Cartman,We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
[OTH],What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
Cartman,"Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?"
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?"
Cartman,"Alright! Let's do it, boys!"
[OTH],"I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
I'm goin' to fingerbang-bang you ever-y night"
Cartman,"And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--"
[OTH],"Alright, that's enough!"
Cartman,"--you're my fantasy, you fanta--"
[OTH],Thank you.
Cartman,"Well, so can we play here?"
[OTH],What?? ...No.
Cartman,No??
[OTH],Who?? No!
Cartman,Why not?!
[OTH],"Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?"
Cartman,"You don't think we're any good, do you?!"
[OTH],"No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese."
Cartman,"Well, come on guys. We gave it our best."
[OTH],Wow. That was your best?
[OTH],Wow. I feel so rejected.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],There you are! You're the hoodlums who got on the intercom and started an orange smoothie riot!
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--
[OTH],Run for it!
[OTH],"Go get 'em, rookie!"
[OTH],Where is Stan?
[OTH],"Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band."
[OTH],What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
[OTH],"Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it."
[OTH],"And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?!"
[OTH],"Mom, what's up Dad's ass?"
[OTH],"It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now."
[OTH],"Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric."
Cartman,"Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems."
[OTH],"Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out."
Cartman,I just don't know what I'm gonna do. Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me.
[OTH],"Alright, Eric, what's the matter?"
Cartman,"Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean, I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know?"
[OTH],"Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect."
Cartman,What's the Gomlich effect?
[OTH],"The law of physics that states, ""If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."""
Cartman,So how do boy bands use that?
[OTH],"All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy! Uh-uh, except for Lillith, of course."
Cartman,Thanks!
[OTH],"You're welcome. Now, go away!"
Cartman,Okay.
[OTH],A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
Cartman,Cucumber in the pants. Got it.
Cartman,"Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?"
[OTH],"Are we gonna get paid now, or after?"
Cartman,"I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera."
[OTH],Tiimmmaaayyy!
[OTH],"Dude, what's wrong with your leg?"
Cartman,"Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck."
[OTH],Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.
Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!"
[OTH],Huhaaaaah!
Cartman,"Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!"
[OTH],We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
[OTH],...Matt Lauer.
Cartman,"...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer."
[OTH],Oh... Okay.
Cartman,Roll camera!
[OTH],Timmuh!
[OTH],AAAGGGGHHH!
Cartman,Jesus Christ!
[OTH],Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
Cartman,"Aaand cut! Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!"
[OTH],"Okay, so where's our money?"
Cartman,"Oh uh, Kyle has it."
[OTH],"Stanley, what the hell are you doing?"
[OTH],We are making a music video.
[OTH],You get in the truck right now!
[OTH],"Dad, I was just a--"
[OTH],Get in the truck!
[OTH],"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?"
[OTH],"Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed."
[OTH],"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting."
[OTH],"Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Well, maybe it's time."
[OTH],Dad!
[OTH],Ey! What are you doin'?
[OTH],I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!
[OTH],"Move along, sir."
[OTH],Wuh?
Cartman,"Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine."
[OTH],God dammit!
Cartman,Hello again!
[OTH],What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
Cartman,I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
[OTH],Oh. What?
Cartman,"If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed!"
[OTH],Timmiihh!
Cartman,"Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool."
[OTH],"Haaghh. Timmih, livin' a lie!"
Cartman,Son of a bitch!
[OTH],Hey. This video is dumb.
Cartman,You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
[OTH],"Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side. For a little while."
Cartman,Really? You will?
[OTH],"Only for twenty minutes, though."
Cartman,That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
[OTH],Oh. Okay.
Cartman,"Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed!"
[OTH],"Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay?"
[OTH],"You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay?"
Cartman,"Aw, Mom!"
[OTH],Wow. What?
[OTH],"It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?"
[OTH],Because I said so!
[OTH],"Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me."
[OTH],"Let 'em be pissed off, then!"
[OTH],"I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--"
[OTH],No!! NOOO!!
[OTH],Dad? What the hell is going on?
[OTH],...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver. I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience.
[OTH],"Kid, can I talk to you?"
[OTH],Uh sure.
[OTH],"Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town."
[OTH],"Ohh, thanks."
[OTH],Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
[OTH],What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
[OTH],"Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?"
[OTH],"Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--"
[OTH],"Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--"
[OTH],"No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it."
[OTH],I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning.
[OTH],And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],...And I left my family.
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],"And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know."
[OTH],Take 112!
[OTH],"You've... got... it!
You know you've got... it What you've got is it!"
[OTH],"It's obvious to me, girl"
[OTH],"The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world."
[OTH],"Shirl! You've... got... it!
It... is what you've got, girl!
What you've got is it!"
[OTH],"Now, give it to me, 'cause..."
[OTH],"I had everything. A huge house, and all the women you can imagine. And then one day, just as quick as it started..."
[OTH],"Alright, guys, let's take it from the top."
[OTH],"Hey, Mr. Allens."
[OTH],Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.
[OTH],Who are they?
[OTH],"These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band."
[OTH],"But, w-we're still selling records, right?"
[OTH],"Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band."
[OTH],I'm 19.
[OTH],"Get a life, Marsh! Alright, guys, let's take it from the top."
[OTH],"They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car..."
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],...the women all left...
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],...and they took back my house.
[OTH],Ugh..!
[OTH],See ya.
[OTH],"The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned."
[OTH],"Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?"
[OTH],"Sure, I remember you! You got it, baby... You got it, baby"
[OTH],"And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about."
[OTH],Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
[OTH],"I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world. That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley. It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall."
[OTH],...Oh-kay.
[OTH],Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there.
Cartman,Where the hell is Stan?!
[OTH],He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
Cartman,"I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!"
[OTH],"Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?"
Cartman,"Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member."
[OTH],Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer.
Cartman,Yeah. We'll start right away. We'll have to do it without him.
[OTH],Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
[OTH],(Yeah!)
Cartman,"Oh, god-dammit!"
[OTH],Dad?
[OTH],Huh? Yeah?
[OTH],"Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had."
[OTH],"Come here, Stanley. Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?"
[OTH],Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
[OTH],"Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall."
[OTH],Really?
[OTH],Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],What's happening here?
[OTH],"I don't know, uh. I guess nothing."
[OTH],"Hm... Well, let's just walk away then."
Cartman,God dammit! People are walking away!
[OTH],"Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart."
Cartman,Just another minute.
[OTH],Sorry. Get out!
Cartman,"Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],It's Stan!
Cartman,"Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name!"
[OTH],"Dude, where the hell have you been?!"
Cartman,"Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?"
[OTH],"Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up."
Cartman,"We will! Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall."" And so, without further ado, all five members of the..."
[OTH],(Uff--!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
Cartman,No! He can't be dead!
[OTH],"Dude, he's pretty dead."
Cartman,No! We were so close!
[OTH],"Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!"
Cartman,But we have to perform!
[OTH],"We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Oh, yes we do."
Cartman,"Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!"
[OTH],"Fingerbang!
Bang bang Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright 'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night!"
Cartman,"Chuh! Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!"
[OTH],We made two dollars.
[OTH],"You were great, Dad."
[OTH],Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
[OTH],Can I get your autograph?
Cartman,"Ok-Okay, okay."
[OTH],"Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am."
[OTH],"I actually don't really know who they are, I was just getting an autograph and-- A-a-agg-g-ggh!"
[OTH],"Move along, ma'am. Eh, that was pretty good, kids. Maybe you can come perform at my Elks Club sometime."
Cartman,"Okay, yeah, maybe. God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"""
[OTH],...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
[OTH],Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
[OTH],"Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie."
[OTH],I don't think they sell those anymore.
[OTH],"Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million?"
Cartman,"Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy. You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah."
[OTH],"I walk hand-in-hand with Jesus
Over at the park by where he lives
I tell him all my problems And sometimes he tells me his
What a friend I have in Jesus I can say that honestly He's not like all my other friends
Who really don't care about me.
Amen."
[OTH],Bo-ring.
[OTH],"And now Mr. Mackey will read his favorite psalm for us, Psalm 46."
[OTH],"Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea..."
Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation. This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."""
[OTH],"God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay. Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place-"
[OTH],"Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."""
Cartman,"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation to increase the population of the younger generation."""
[OTH],(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
Cartman,"No no, no. Separation."
[OTH],"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"""
[OTH],BOYS! You are in CHURCH!
Cartman,Ugh!
[OTH],"-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell. Hell is not a very nice place. Burning, searing, flames. Screaming, torture. For eternity. Once you are in hell, you cannot escape. You live forever in horrible pain, in burning agony. All sinners are there in misery, dying over and over and over. If you be cast down into this black bog of stench, then woe is thou, for Satan has made it the most miserable place in the universe! And he will be your ruler! Your ruler of pain and agony!"
[OTH],"Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau? Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau? Everybody loves a hukilau-"
[OTH],I do!
[OTH],"Where the laulau is the kaukau at the luau We throw our nets out into the sea And all the ama-ama come swimmin' to me Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?"
[OTH],Are we going to the Hukilau?
[OTH],The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
[OTH],"Everybody loves a Hukilau,"
[OTH],Where the laulau is the kaukau at the luau
[OTH],"'We throw our nets out into the sea. And all the ama-ama come a-swimming to me Are we going to the Hukilau? The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
Huki... Luki... Lau?..."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Hennnh!
[OTH],Aaawwwwwww!
[OTH],"Great luau, Satan."
[OTH],"Thanks. See ya, Gary. Thanks for comin'. Oh- Hi, Marsha."
[OTH],"Satan, a few of us are gonna go pound some brews. You wanna join us?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Matthau, but I can't. Chris and I just moved to the west side and we have to unpack."
[OTH],"Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!"
[OTH],Bye.
[OTH],Chris?
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],"Did you, uh, see my ""Boy With An Umbrella"" Hummel?"
[OTH],"Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers."
[OTH],"Oh, okay, thanks. Oh, that must be them now. Just put the boxes by the-"
[OTH],"Hello, Satan!"
[OTH],Saddam...
[OTH],"Did you miss me, buttercup?"
[OTH],"No, it can't be! You're dead! I killed you!"
[OTH],"Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
[OTH],"Oh no. Oh, God no."
[OTH],"A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ! Children in this town have not been attending Sunday school after Mass! And adults have not been coming to Confession! If this does not change, I promise you, you will be going to the black pit of Satan's world! That is all. Peace be with you."
[OTH],"Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn!
Cartman,"Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom."
[OTH],"Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death."
[OTH],"Hell is a very real place, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire!"
[OTH],"Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk."
[OTH],"I don't want to talk to you, Saddam! This isn't what I need in my life right now."
[OTH],"Is that the movers, Satan?"
[OTH],"Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just the movers"
[OTH],"Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter."
[OTH],"Okay, Chris."
[OTH],"Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan."
[OTH],"Oh, why, I haven't heard that one before."
[OTH],"COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito? ¡Me gusta burrito mucho!"
[OTH],"I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now."
[OTH],Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
[OTH],"Good-bye, Saddam!"
[OTH],"Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us. You can try, but you know we belong together."
[OTH],"My life is good now, Saddam. Chris treats me well. You and I are through. Good-bye."
[OTH],"Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break!"
[OTH],"Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion."
[OTH],Are we gonna go to hell?
[OTH],"Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion."
Cartman,"A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?"
[OTH],What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
Cartman,"Yeah, what if we haven't?"
[OTH],"It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works. The priest will give you this round cracker, and he will say, ""The Body of Christ,"" and then you eat it."
Cartman,Jesus was made of crackers?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],But crackers are his- body.
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],(What?!)
[OTH],"In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, ""eat this, for it is my body."""
Cartman,So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
[OTH],Nononono!
[OTH],"Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?"
[OTH],The Body of Christ!
[OTH],"Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him."
[OTH],No!
[OTH],No??
[OTH],Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
[OTH],"Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?!"
Cartman,O-kay.
[OTH],"And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ."
Cartman,"Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly!"
[OTH],"Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!"
Cartman,Nno!
[OTH],Then stop questioning me.
Cartman,"But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?"
[OTH],"No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession."
[OTH],Confession?
[OTH],"You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything."
[OTH],"(OH, SHIT!)"
[OTH],"Those were some great pork chops, Satan."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Hey, you. You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?"
[OTH],Nothing. Why?
[OTH],"Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly."
[OTH],"Oh, huh. Sorry, huh-huh."
[OTH],"Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?"
[OTH],"Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today."
[OTH],Oh. Woww! I wasn't ready for that.
[OTH],He showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me...
[OTH],I thought you... killed him.
[OTH],"Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit?"
[OTH],...Do you still love him?
[OTH],"No, Chris."
[OTH],It's okay of you do.
[OTH],"Well, I mean- Of course, there's a part of me that will always love him, I... But I also know how abusive he was—I'm much happier with you."
[OTH],"Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy."
[OTH],"No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy."
[OTH],"Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself. Oops! Aw, butternuts!"
[OTH],"Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days."
Cartman,"Oh yeah, okay."
[OTH],And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
Cartman,"Right, I already got that one."
[OTH],"Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?"
[OTH],We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
[OTH],Uhwuwhat?
[OTH],Have you confessed all your sins yet?
[OTH],No-o-o-o-o!
Cartman,"Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins."
[OTH],Oh good. I don't?
Cartman,"No, you're already going to hell."
[OTH],I am not!
Cartman,"You are, too!"
[OTH],"Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period."
[OTH],I'm gonna go ask my mom!
[OTH],"Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?"
Cartman,Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
[OTH],(What?)
[OTH],Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
[OTH],"What, Butters?"
[OTH],"Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?"
[OTH],Timmiih!
Cartman,What'd we do to Timmy?
[OTH],"No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!"
[OTH],Timmiih!
Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed."
[OTH],"Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something."
[OTH],(What are we gonna do?)
[OTH],I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
[OTH],"I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my life is so much better now with Chris. Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect in every way, but there's just something about Saddam that I'm more attracted to. In what way? Yeah, you're right. Saddam would just treat me bad again. I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. Put him out of my mind and focus on Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I won't have such strong feelings for him. Thanks guys."
[OTH],There you are.
[OTH],"Oh hi, Chris!"
[OTH],I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight."
[OTH],You WHAT?!
[OTH],I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
[OTH],"Oh, Chris! Rraarr! Rraahh!"
[OTH],"Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together."
[OTH],"No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is what he'll do!"
[OTH],"Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore."
[OTH],"Oh, dear God."
[OTH],"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-"
Cartman,How was it?
[OTH],"Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!"
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
Cartman,Who's in there?
[OTH],I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
Cartman,"Well, here goes everything."
Cartman,"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned."
[OTH],"Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess?"
Cartman,"Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass..."
[OTH],"...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-"
[OTH],"(Hey, dude.)"
[OTH],God damnit!
[OTH],(What??)
[OTH],"Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy. Sister Anne?"
[OTH],"Oh, hello, children."
[OTH],We have a question.
[OTH],"Okay, shoot."
[OTH],Where do handicapped people go when they die?
[OTH],"The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins."
[OTH],"But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?"
[OTH],"Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest. I'll see if I can find him. Bye."
Cartman,"And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?"
[OTH],Your con- confession does not leave this box.
Cartman,"Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew."
Cartman,"No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it."
[OTH],I... see.
Cartman,"Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog. And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of- -eh- Ow! D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow! Eh! Oh! Help. Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!"
[OTH],Father! I need to talk to you. Father! I have to ask you a question.
[OTH],"Okayokay, fine!"
Cartman,Uh-huh- Oho! Ohoho.
[OTH],What happened??
Cartman,"I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God. He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously."
[OTH],"Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein."
[OTH],"And you must be Mr. Assface. Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy. Here, I brought you a potato."
[OTH],"Oh, thank you."
[OTH],"Chris, no! It's a bomb!"
[OTH],"Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?"
[OTH],"Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right? Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it."
[OTH],"Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready."
[OTH],"behayin' glah, and the he find de eye."
[OTH],"Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day."
[OTH],Cookie monstooh.
[OTH],"Oh, he's growing up so fast!"
[OTH],Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
[OTH],"Why? What did you do, Kyle?!"
[OTH],"Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell."
[OTH],"Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell."
[OTH],We don't? But what if we're wrong?
[OTH],"Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too."
[OTH],"Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell."
[OTH],"Oh, no."
[OTH],"Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?"
[OTH],No-o-o.
[OTH],"Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me!"
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
[OTH],"Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?"
[OTH],"It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died."
[OTH],"Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?"
[OTH],"Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy."
[OTH],An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
[OTH],"L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship And I just want you to know that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends."
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with. And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything. Right? Right.
[OTH],"Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine."
[OTH],"Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized?"
[OTH],I don't think so.
[OTH],"Then, hell awaits him."
[OTH],"Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to-"
[OTH],"They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!"
[OTH],"Yes, but-"
[OTH],Mister Father! We have to ask you something.
[OTH],"Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?"
[OTH],"Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?"
[OTH],"Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, ""Depart from me, you cursèd, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."" Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire."
[OTH],Oh no.
[OTH],Father-
[OTH],I hope to see all of you in church this Sunday.
Cartman,We will be.
[OTH],"Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewish people are good, they will get into heaven."
[OTH],"Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell do you go to hell for?!"
[OTH],Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
[OTH],Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on.
[OTH],"Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more."
Cartman,Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
[OTH],HAAAAH!
Cartman,Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin!"
Cartman,"Oh, now you've said it, too!"
[OTH],"Oh, shit! Oh!"
[OTH],(Fuck! Oops!)
Cartman,"Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again."
[OTH],But what about them?
Cartman,"Ugh. Oh, I know. We can use Wacky Water Weasel!"
[OTH],Haaaaah!
[OTH],"Okay, come on."
[OTH],"Haaa-ay, Timmmiih!"
[OTH],"Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired."
[OTH],Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back.
[OTH],Good. I'll show you out.
[OTH],"Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff. Satan, that guy is a pussy!"
[OTH],"He's stable, Saddam!"
[OTH],"Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!"
[OTH],Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it!
[OTH],"For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan."
[OTH],I'm very happy with my life now.
[OTH],Here. I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
[OTH],"No, Saddam! I won't be needing this!"
[OTH],"D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight. Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!"
[OTH],Goodnight
[OTH],"Hello. Your Excellency? This is Sister Anne, the Bleeding Eyes of Jesus, calling from the United States?"
[OTH],"Yes, I understand you want to speak-a wit the pope."
[OTH],"Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped."
[OTH],"Yes, well the pope is here, but please keep it brief. He is a-very old."
[OTH],Heh??
[OTH],"Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities."
[OTH],Heh?
[OTH],Do mentally-challenged people go to hell?
[OTH],"Ehhhhh, what's that you say? Heh?!"
[OTH],Handicap. Mental handicap.
[OTH],Fibibiibibibibiibibih.
[OTH],...The priest here said that people with mental handicaps might end up in hell. Is that true?
[OTH],Eh-bibibiibibibibiibibibih.
[OTH],Come on! This stupid light won't change.
[OTH],"Come on! Hurry up! Hey, what are you guys doin'?"
[OTH],We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
[OTH],Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
[OTH],"Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell."
[OTH],"Uh, come on, let's go."
[OTH],(Yow!)
[OTH],"...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],He had sins that he didn't confess!
Cartman,And he never took Communion!
[OTH],He's doomed.
[OTH],...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah. That's hot. You take it! You take it now!
[OTH],"Chris, what are you doing?"
[OTH],"I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too."
[OTH],Oh boy.
[OTH],"Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch? I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that."
[OTH],"Chris, just... don't... don't do that."
[OTH],But it turns you on.
[OTH],"No, it's a- When Saddam did it, yeah, but uh..."
[OTH],But what?
[OTH],"Nothing. I just- I'm just- really tired is all. Can we- just, please go to sleep? Chris, seriously. I'm just tired, okay?"
[OTH],"Okay. I love you, Satan."
[OTH],"I love you too, Saddam."
[OTH],Wuh?!
[OTH],"Waw. Uhuh. I'm sorry, I mean, Chris."
[OTH],"It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do."
[OTH],I just need to go get some air. okay? I'll be back... really quick.
[OTH],Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Cartman,"Come on, hurry up!"
[OTH],Oh no! It's locked!
Cartman,What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
[OTH],"Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open."
[OTH],Confession box is over there!
Cartman,"I'm first, I'm first!"
[OTH],"Oh, huhuh."
Cartman,What the?
[OTH],Whoa! Son of a bitch!
[OTH],"Eh, heheheheheheh."
[OTH],"Uhuh. Kids, uh."
[OTH],You're a sinner!
Cartman,You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
[OTH],"Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh. Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you!"
Cartman,"Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!"
[OTH],M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell!
[OTH],"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?"
Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!"
[OTH],"Oh, the pain! Oh, the pain!"
[OTH],"No, I can't. What am I doing? I know this is the wrong thing to do. I could lose Chris. I can't do this. I can't do this."
Cartman,"We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh! If thy hand offend thee, cut it off! It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-"
[OTH],"Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!"
[OTH],Oh no.
[OTH],Pamphlet. Pamphlet.
Cartman,There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
[OTH],I don't wanna to go to hell.
Cartman,"It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!"
[OTH],"I walk hand-in-hand with Jesus
Over at the park by where he lives
I tell him all my problems And sometimes he tells me his
What a friend I have in Jesus I can say that honestly He's not like all my other friends
Who really don't care about me.
Amen."
[OTH],Bo-ring.
[OTH],"And now Mr. Mackey will read his favorite psalm for us, Psalm 46."
[OTH],"Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea..."
Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation. This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."""
[OTH],"God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay. Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place-"
[OTH],"Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."""
Cartman,"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation to increase the population of the younger generation."""
[OTH],(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
Cartman,"No no, no. Separation."
[OTH],"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"""
[OTH],BOYS! You are in CHURCH!
Cartman,Ugh!
[OTH],"-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay."
[OTH],"Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell. Hell is not a very nice place. Burning, searing, flames. Screaming, torture. For eternity. Once you are in hell, you cannot escape. You live forever in horrible pain, in burning agony. All sinners are there in misery, dying over and over and over. If you be cast down into this black bog of stench, then woe is thou, for Satan has made it the most miserable place in the universe! And he will be your ruler! Your ruler of pain and agony!"
[OTH],"Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau? Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau? Everybody loves a hukilau-"
[OTH],I do!
[OTH],"Where the laulau is the kaukau at the luau We throw our nets out into the sea And all the ama-ama come swimmin' to me Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?"
[OTH],Are we going to the Hukilau?
[OTH],The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
[OTH],"Everybody loves a Hukilau,"
[OTH],Where the laulau is the kaukau at the luau
[OTH],"'We throw our nets out into the sea. And all the ama-ama come a-swimming to me Are we going to the Hukilau? The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
Huki... Luki... Lau?..."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Hennnh!
[OTH],Aaawwwwwww!
[OTH],"Great luau, Satan."
[OTH],"Thanks. See ya, Gary. Thanks for comin'. Oh- Hi, Marsha."
[OTH],"Satan, a few of us are gonna go pound some brews. You wanna join us?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Matthau, but I can't. Chris and I just moved to the west side and we have to unpack."
[OTH],"Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!"
[OTH],Bye.
[OTH],Chris?
[OTH],Yeah?
[OTH],"Did you, uh, see my ""Boy With An Umbrella"" Hummel?"
[OTH],"Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers."
[OTH],"Oh, okay, thanks. Oh, that must be them now. Just put the boxes by the-"
[OTH],"Hello, Satan!"
[OTH],Saddam...
[OTH],"Did you miss me, buttercup?"
[OTH],"No, it can't be! You're dead! I killed you!"
[OTH],"Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
[OTH],"Oh no. Oh, God no."
[OTH],"A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ! Children in this town have not been attending Sunday school after Mass! And adults have not been coming to Confession! If this does not change, I promise you, you will be going to the black pit of Satan's world! That is all. Peace be with you."
[OTH],"Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn!
Cartman,"Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom."
[OTH],"Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death."
[OTH],"Hell is a very real place, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire!"
[OTH],"Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk."
[OTH],"I don't want to talk to you, Saddam! This isn't what I need in my life right now."
[OTH],"Is that the movers, Satan?"
[OTH],"Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just the movers"
[OTH],"Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter."
[OTH],"Okay, Chris."
[OTH],"Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan."
[OTH],"Oh, why, I haven't heard that one before."
[OTH],"COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito? ¡Me gusta burrito mucho!"
[OTH],"I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now."
[OTH],Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
[OTH],"Good-bye, Saddam!"
[OTH],"Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us. You can try, but you know we belong together."
[OTH],"My life is good now, Saddam. Chris treats me well. You and I are through. Good-bye."
[OTH],"Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break!"
[OTH],"Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion."
[OTH],Are we gonna go to hell?
[OTH],"Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion."
Cartman,"A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?"
[OTH],What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
Cartman,"Yeah, what if we haven't?"
[OTH],"It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works. The priest will give you this round cracker, and he will say, ""The Body of Christ,"" and then you eat it."
Cartman,Jesus was made of crackers?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],But crackers are his- body.
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],(What?!)
[OTH],"In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, ""eat this, for it is my body."""
Cartman,So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
[OTH],Nononono!
[OTH],"Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?"
[OTH],The Body of Christ!
[OTH],"Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him."
[OTH],No!
[OTH],No??
[OTH],Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
[OTH],"Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?!"
Cartman,O-kay.
[OTH],"And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ."
Cartman,"Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly!"
[OTH],"Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!"
Cartman,Nno!
[OTH],Then stop questioning me.
Cartman,"But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?"
[OTH],"No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession."
[OTH],Confession?
[OTH],"You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything."
[OTH],"(OH, SHIT!)"
[OTH],"Those were some great pork chops, Satan."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Hey, you. You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?"
[OTH],Nothing. Why?
[OTH],"Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly."
[OTH],"Oh, huh. Sorry, huh-huh."
[OTH],"Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?"
[OTH],"Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today."
[OTH],Oh. Woww! I wasn't ready for that.
[OTH],He showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me...
[OTH],I thought you... killed him.
[OTH],"Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit?"
[OTH],...Do you still love him?
[OTH],"No, Chris."
[OTH],It's okay of you do.
[OTH],"Well, I mean- Of course, there's a part of me that will always love him, I... But I also know how abusive he was—I'm much happier with you."
[OTH],"Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy."
[OTH],"No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy."
[OTH],"Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself. Oops! Aw, butternuts!"
[OTH],"Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days."
Cartman,"Oh yeah, okay."
[OTH],And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
Cartman,"Right, I already got that one."
[OTH],"Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?"
[OTH],We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
[OTH],Uhwuwhat?
[OTH],Have you confessed all your sins yet?
[OTH],No-o-o-o-o!
Cartman,"Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins."
[OTH],Oh good. I don't?
Cartman,"No, you're already going to hell."
[OTH],I am not!
Cartman,"You are, too!"
[OTH],"Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period."
[OTH],I'm gonna go ask my mom!
[OTH],"Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?"
Cartman,Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
[OTH],(What?)
[OTH],Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
[OTH],"What, Butters?"
[OTH],"Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?"
[OTH],Timmiih!
Cartman,What'd we do to Timmy?
[OTH],"No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!"
[OTH],Timmiih!
Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed."
[OTH],"Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something."
[OTH],(What are we gonna do?)
[OTH],I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
[OTH],"I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my life is so much better now with Chris. Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect in every way, but there's just something about Saddam that I'm more attracted to. In what way? Yeah, you're right. Saddam would just treat me bad again. I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. Put him out of my mind and focus on Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I won't have such strong feelings for him. Thanks guys."
[OTH],There you are.
[OTH],"Oh hi, Chris!"
[OTH],I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight."
[OTH],You WHAT?!
[OTH],I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
[OTH],"Oh, Chris! Rraarr! Rraahh!"
[OTH],"Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together."
[OTH],"No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is what he'll do!"
[OTH],"Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore."
[OTH],"Oh, dear God."
[OTH],"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-"
Cartman,How was it?
[OTH],"Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!"
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
Cartman,Who's in there?
[OTH],I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
Cartman,"Well, here goes everything."
Cartman,"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned."
[OTH],"Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess?"
Cartman,"Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass..."
[OTH],"...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-"
[OTH],"(Hey, dude.)"
[OTH],God damnit!
[OTH],(What??)
[OTH],"Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy. Sister Anne?"
[OTH],"Oh, hello, children."
[OTH],We have a question.
[OTH],"Okay, shoot."
[OTH],Where do handicapped people go when they die?
[OTH],"The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins."
[OTH],"But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?"
[OTH],"Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest. I'll see if I can find him. Bye."
Cartman,"And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?"
[OTH],Your con- confession does not leave this box.
Cartman,"Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew."
Cartman,"No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it."
[OTH],I... see.
Cartman,"Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog. And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of- -eh- Ow! D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow! Eh! Oh! Help. Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!"
[OTH],Father! I need to talk to you. Father! I have to ask you a question.
[OTH],"Okayokay, fine!"
Cartman,Uh-huh- Oho! Ohoho.
[OTH],What happened??
Cartman,"I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God. He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously."
[OTH],"Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein."
[OTH],"And you must be Mr. Assface. Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy. Here, I brought you a potato."
[OTH],"Oh, thank you."
[OTH],"Chris, no! It's a bomb!"
[OTH],"Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?"
[OTH],"Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right? Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it."
[OTH],"Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready."
[OTH],"behayin' glah, and the he find de eye."
[OTH],"Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day."
[OTH],Cookie monstooh.
[OTH],"Oh, he's growing up so fast!"
[OTH],Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
[OTH],"Why? What did you do, Kyle?!"
[OTH],"Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell."
[OTH],"Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell."
[OTH],We don't? But what if we're wrong?
[OTH],"Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too."
[OTH],"Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell."
[OTH],"Oh, no."
[OTH],"Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?"
[OTH],No-o-o.
[OTH],"Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me!"
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
[OTH],"Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?"
[OTH],"It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died."
[OTH],"Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?"
[OTH],"Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy."
[OTH],An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
[OTH],"L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship And I just want you to know that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends."
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with. And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything. Right? Right.
[OTH],"Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine."
[OTH],"Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized?"
[OTH],I don't think so.
[OTH],"Then, hell awaits him."
[OTH],"Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to-"
[OTH],"They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!"
[OTH],"Yes, but-"
[OTH],Mister Father! We have to ask you something.
[OTH],"Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?"
[OTH],"Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?"
[OTH],"Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, ""Depart from me, you cursèd, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."" Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire."
[OTH],Oh no.
[OTH],Father-
[OTH],I hope to see all of you in church this Sunday.
Cartman,We will be.
[OTH],"Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewish people are good, they will get into heaven."
[OTH],"Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell do you go to hell for?!"
[OTH],Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
[OTH],Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on.
[OTH],"Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more."
Cartman,Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
[OTH],HAAAAH!
Cartman,Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin!"
Cartman,"Oh, now you've said it, too!"
[OTH],"Oh, shit! Oh!"
[OTH],(Fuck! Oops!)
Cartman,"Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again."
[OTH],But what about them?
Cartman,"Ugh. Oh, I know. We can use Wacky Water Weasel!"
[OTH],Haaaaah!
[OTH],"Okay, come on."
[OTH],"Haaa-ay, Timmmiih!"
[OTH],"Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired."
[OTH],Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back.
[OTH],Good. I'll show you out.
[OTH],"Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!"
[OTH],"Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff. Satan, that guy is a pussy!"
[OTH],"He's stable, Saddam!"
[OTH],"Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!"
[OTH],Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it!
[OTH],"For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan."
[OTH],I'm very happy with my life now.
[OTH],Here. I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
[OTH],"No, Saddam! I won't be needing this!"
[OTH],"D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight. Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!"
[OTH],Goodnight
[OTH],"Hello. Your Excellency? This is Sister Anne, the Bleeding Eyes of Jesus, calling from the United States?"
[OTH],"Yes, I understand you want to speak-a wit the pope."
[OTH],"Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped."
[OTH],"Yes, well the pope is here, but please keep it brief. He is a-very old."
[OTH],Heh??
[OTH],"Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities."
[OTH],Heh?
[OTH],Do mentally-challenged people go to hell?
[OTH],"Ehhhhh, what's that you say? Heh?!"
[OTH],Handicap. Mental handicap.
[OTH],Fibibiibibibibiibibih.
[OTH],...The priest here said that people with mental handicaps might end up in hell. Is that true?
[OTH],Eh-bibibiibibibibiibibibih.
[OTH],Come on! This stupid light won't change.
[OTH],"Come on! Hurry up! Hey, what are you guys doin'?"
[OTH],We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
[OTH],Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
[OTH],"Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell."
[OTH],"Uh, come on, let's go."
[OTH],(Yow!)
[OTH],"...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],He had sins that he didn't confess!
Cartman,And he never took Communion!
[OTH],He's doomed.
[OTH],...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah. That's hot. You take it! You take it now!
[OTH],"Chris, what are you doing?"
[OTH],"I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too."
[OTH],Oh boy.
[OTH],"Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch? I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that."
[OTH],"Chris, just... don't... don't do that."
[OTH],But it turns you on.
[OTH],"No, it's a- When Saddam did it, yeah, but uh..."
[OTH],But what?
[OTH],"Nothing. I just- I'm just- really tired is all. Can we- just, please go to sleep? Chris, seriously. I'm just tired, okay?"
[OTH],"Okay. I love you, Satan."
[OTH],"I love you too, Saddam."
[OTH],Wuh?!
[OTH],"Waw. Uhuh. I'm sorry, I mean, Chris."
[OTH],"It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do."
[OTH],I just need to go get some air. okay? I'll be back... really quick.
[OTH],Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Cartman,"Come on, hurry up!"
[OTH],Oh no! It's locked!
Cartman,What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
[OTH],"Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open."
[OTH],Confession box is over there!
Cartman,"I'm first, I'm first!"
[OTH],"Oh, huhuh."
Cartman,What the?
[OTH],Whoa! Son of a bitch!
[OTH],"Eh, heheheheheheh."
[OTH],"Uhuh. Kids, uh."
[OTH],You're a sinner!
Cartman,You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
[OTH],"Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh. Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you!"
Cartman,"Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!"
[OTH],M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell!
[OTH],"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?"
Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!"
[OTH],"Oh, the pain! Oh, the pain!"
[OTH],"No, I can't. What am I doing? I know this is the wrong thing to do. I could lose Chris. I can't do this. I can't do this."
Cartman,"We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh! If thy hand offend thee, cut it off! It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-"
[OTH],"Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!"
[OTH],Oh no.
[OTH],Pamphlet. Pamphlet.
Cartman,There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
[OTH],I don't wanna to go to hell.
Cartman,"It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!"
[OTH],Previously on South Park...
[OTH],"Today, we are going to talk about hell."
[OTH],"Hello, Satan!"
[OTH],Saddam...
[OTH],Us Jews don't believe in hell.
[OTH],But what if we're wrong?
[OTH],Let's go.
[OTH],...they've killed Kenny!
[OTH],He had sins that he didn't confess!
[OTH],"No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now."
[OTH],"Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!"
[OTH],"I love you, Satan."
[OTH],"I love you too, Saddam."
[OTH],Wuh?!
[OTH],"Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis."
[OTH],"Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie."
[OTH],"Oh, huhuh."
[OTH],"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?"
Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!"
[OTH],Go Fonz!!!
[OTH],Aaaaaa--
[OTH],And now the exciting conclusion of... South Park.
[OTH],—aaaaaayy-err. No! No! No! No!
[OTH],I told him he couldn't do it.
Cartman,"I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh!"
[OTH],"You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman. Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone."
[OTH],"Boopie-kins. It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie."
[OTH],"Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school."
[OTH],What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
[OTH],"Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever."
[OTH],"Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school."
Cartman,"Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was smacked down by the Lord-uh! God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh! But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides, so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya to this part hmya. Who will help us?"
[OTH],I will.
Cartman,Praise God-uh!
[OTH],"If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris. Chris has been so nice to me and I know Saddam will just hurt me again. M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam. I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need closure. What am I doing?"
[OTH],"What took yo so long, baby?"
[OTH],"Saddam, I'm just here to talk."
[OTH],"Great! Let's talk! Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy."
[OTH],"Saddam, I only came here because I need closure."
[OTH],"Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything."
[OTH],"No! Saddam, listen to me."
[OTH],Would you like a drink?
[OTH],"Um, maybe just... a little one. I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore. I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now. What is this?"
[OTH],These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
[OTH],"Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now."
[OTH],"Really? So then... What are you doing here? Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!"
[OTH],Saddam...
[OTH],"Here, have another drink."
[OTH],"Ooh, whoa... God, my head. Drank too much. Chris? Oh no!!"
[OTH],"Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil! Ewuh, I'm all greasy."
[OTH],"Oh God, what time is it?"
[OTH],Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
[OTH],"I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris."
[OTH],Screw him!!
[OTH],"No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation! I just don't know what I'm gonna say."
[OTH],I know how to solve this little problem.
[OTH],"We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula. We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination."
[OTH],Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus.
[OTH],'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus?
[OTH],(Ahow..!)
[OTH],"Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay?"
[OTH],Pienso que sí.
[OTH],"Well, here's fifty for the gas. Adios."
[OTH],(Where am I?)
[OTH],¿Qué?
[OTH],(Where am I?)
[OTH],¿Qué?
Cartman,This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
[OTH],There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
[OTH],"Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!"
[OTH],"Hello, boys."
[OTH],"Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!"
[OTH],"It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away. Just really quick; she says it's very important."
Cartman,"Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants."
[OTH],I sure hope this works.
[OTH],"Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise."
[OTH],"Wow, cool."
Cartman,"No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"This is a distraction from our work on the church! Do not think that you can tempt us with toys and new games and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with! Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh. Well, alrighty then."
[OTH],I... don't think it worked.
[OTH],Aww.
Cartman,"Let us get back to our work at the church. Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah. Hello?"
[OTH],"(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)"
Cartman,Oh my God!!
[OTH],What?
Cartman,It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
[OTH],Kenny?! What's he say?
[OTH],Ask him what hell is like.
Cartman,Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
[OTH],(Um...)
[OTH],"Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes."
[OTH],"Hey, you."
[OTH],"Hi, Chris."
[OTH],You... were out all night.
[OTH],"Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina."
[OTH],"Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Satan, I understand."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I still feel secure and safe with you.
[OTH],"Oh, n-no!"
[OTH],What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],"Well, what more do you want from me?"
[OTH],"Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say ""If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!"" or, or ""I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!"" or something?"
[OTH],"Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything."
[OTH],"Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake."
[OTH],Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.
[OTH],"Ah—I'm sorry, Chris, it's... it's not you, really, it's, it's me. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for some reason, I just can't accept that."
[OTH],"Die, pussy!"
[OTH],Agghhh!
[OTH],"Chris! Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!"
[OTH],There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
[OTH],No! Not like this..!
Cartman,"Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh. It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh. He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish."
[OTH],Wagghh..!
Cartman,"He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!"
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,"And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!"
[OTH],Wagghh!
[OTH],Where is our daughter?
[OTH],Dad?
[OTH],Marcy! You're coming home this instant!
Cartman,"We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh!"
[OTH],You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
Cartman,"Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!"
[OTH],You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that-- Aagghh--!
[OTH],"Stephen? Stephen, no!"
Cartman,"The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!"
[OTH],"Forgive us, Lord."
Cartman,"Let us pray. Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry."
[OTH],Stephen? Stephen?
[OTH],Where... where am I?
[OTH],Where are we?
[OTH],No doubt about it...
[OTH],What's happening??
[OTH],Oooooooooh!
[OTH],"Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody hear me? Hello? Can everyb--? Okay. Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks like we have about 8,615 of you newbies today, and for those of you who are a little confused, uh, you are dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now going to start the orientation process, which will last about--"
[OTH],"Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven!"
[OTH],"Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong."
[OTH],I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.
[OTH],"Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well."
[OTH],"Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?"
[OTH],"I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan."
[OTH],Oooyeah!
[OTH],Aaggghh!
[OTH],"Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh... muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry."
[OTH],"Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims..."
[OTH],Satan! 'Scuse me. Excuse me.
[OTH],Chris! But I thought you were dead!
[OTH],"Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
[OTH],"Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in--"
[OTH],"Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?"
[OTH],Uh... yeah. Gr-great.
[OTH],Awww.
Cartman,"Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting."
[OTH],"Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you."
Cartman,"Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon."
[OTH],"Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives."
Cartman,"Sister, have you read this book?"
[OTH],"Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have."
Cartman,Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
[OTH],"Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives."
Cartman,Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
[OTH],No.
Cartman,"We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus!"
[OTH],Uugh..! Wait a minute. That's it.
[OTH],...And I'm gonna save all of you right now. I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.
Cartman,Well...
[OTH],"Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!"
[OTH],Yeah. It's me.
[OTH],I thought I killed you!
[OTH],Yeah...
[OTH],"Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
[OTH],"Right, right."
[OTH],Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
[OTH],A walk?
[OTH],Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
[OTH],Is this some kind of trick?
[OTH],"No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?"
[OTH],"Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick. Okay, let's walk."
[OTH],"Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much."
[OTH],"Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?"
[OTH],"Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them."
[OTH],"You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy!"
[OTH],Agghhh! Oh God!
[OTH],Ah hahaha!
[OTH],Nooo! Agh!
[OTH],Aggghhh!
[OTH],Ow! Goo-aagh..!
Cartman,"Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?"
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,"That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh! Theah!"
[OTH],Ow!
Cartman,Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
[OTH],"Uh, I think so."
Cartman,Praise the Lord-uh!
[OTH],Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise God!
Cartman,"For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person! This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!"
[OTH],Huh-Hallelujah!
[OTH],Timmiiiy!
Cartman,We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
[OTH],Timmiiiy!
Cartman,Devil be gone-uh!
[OTH],Haagggh.
Cartman,"Now walk, Timmih!"
[OTH],Haagggh.
Cartman,"Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!"
[OTH],Haghh.
Cartman,"The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih!"
[OTH],Timmilih?
Cartman,He walks-uh!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Oh-aagghhh!
Cartman,Yes! Praise the Lord!
[OTH],Praise the Lord!
[OTH],"And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all."
[OTH],"Wow, that really sucks."
[OTH],"I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer."
[OTH],"Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],God.
[OTH],"God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years."
[OTH],"Well then, maybe it's time."
[OTH],Do dodo dum do dodoDo dodo dum do dodo
Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy?"
[OTH],Denver.
Cartman,And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
[OTH],"Yeah, that's right."
[OTH],Wooooo!
Cartman,"Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone!"
[OTH],Aghh...
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!"
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at! Bah!
[OTH],Wagh...
Cartman,"Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say ""Amen!"""
[OTH],Amen!
[OTH],"Lord, Lord, Lord"
[OTH],"Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!"
[OTH],"Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by."
[OTH],"Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades."
[OTH],Alright. Yeah.
[OTH],"And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie."
[OTH],Ooooh!
[OTH],Yeahahah!
[OTH],"Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?"
[OTH],Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there.
[OTH],I'm so grateful for that.
[OTH],"Me, too. Uh huh."
[OTH],Great. Thanks.
[OTH],Ah... Hello? G-God? It's uh... Satan.
[OTH],"Yea. Look upon me, and know me."
[OTH],"Hi, God."
[OTH],"Hello, Satan. It's... been a long time."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?
[OTH],"No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice."
[OTH],You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
[OTH],"No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April..."
Cartman,"Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah, and putting a dollar in the box-ah! Come on, don't be shy! Come on now!"
[OTH],"Dude, that seems kind of... weird."
[OTH],Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
[OTH],...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.
[OTH],"Jesus, what the hell happened to you?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.
[OTH],"Well, I just don't know which one to pick."
[OTH],"No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them. And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist."
[OTH],"God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself."
[OTH],Bingo.
[OTH],"Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes."
[OTH],"It was nice to see you again, Satan."
[OTH],You too.
[OTH],Goodbye.
[OTH],Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch?
[OTH],"Yes, would you?"
[OTH],"Uh, no, I need to be getting back."
[OTH],"Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play."
[OTH],Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life.
[OTH],"Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really gotta go."
[OTH],"Well, he seemed like a nice fellow."
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Let's go make things out of egg cartons.
[OTH],"Oooh, yeah. I'll do that."
Cartman,"Yeess. Yeess. It worked, you guys, it actually worked!"
[OTH],What worked?
Cartman,Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],You're keeping that money yourself?
Cartman,"Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars! Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route."
[OTH],Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
Cartman,"It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school."
[OTH],"Well, what about going to hell and all that?!"
Cartman,"Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that."
[OTH],Then why didn't you tell us?!
Cartman,"My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!"
[OTH],The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
Cartman,Suck my balls!
[OTH],"Dude, I am so disillusioned right now."
[OTH],"Die, pussy!"
[OTH],Ow..!
[OTH],Aagghh!
[OTH],Aagghh!
[OTH],"Guys, guys, guys! Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision."
[OTH],You have?
[OTH],Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want. So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself."
[OTH],Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
[OTH],"No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!"
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you!"
Cartman,Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh!
[OTH],"Alright kids, it's time to go. It's time for this to stop!"
Cartman,Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
[OTH],I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else.
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],Jesus!
Cartman,Uh-oh.
[OTH],"Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school."
Cartman,"Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay."
[OTH],"God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him."
Cartman,"Ee-yes, by doing that, and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!"
[OTH],Let's go ice-skating.
[OTH],Yea!
[OTH],"Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"No, come back! You face everlasting damnation! Wait! No! No! I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!"
[OTH],"Serves you right, Cartman!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!"
Cartman,You're gonna send me to hell?
[OTH],No. Worse!
[OTH],(Eric! Eric!)
Cartman,"Aw, crap!"
[OTH],"Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick."
[OTH],"Hi, Satan."
[OTH],There you are!
[OTH],Awgh... Not again.
[OTH],You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
[OTH],"Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore!"
[OTH],"You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me."
[OTH],"Yes, I can! Raaarrr!"
[OTH],"Aw, you little..prick!"
[OTH],"Goodbye forever, Saddam!"
[OTH],"What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow."
[OTH],Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.
[OTH],Let me in where?
[OTH],"What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!"
[OTH],"Hello, and welcome."
[OTH],"We're glad you made it, brother."
[OTH],"Ey, who the hell are you?"
[OTH],"We're just about to do a play, about how much stealing hurts you deep inside. Come join us."
[OTH],Yes. Come on. Let's go.
[OTH],You're here forever.
[OTH],Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!
[OTH],Previously on South Park...
[OTH],"Today, we are going to talk about hell."
[OTH],"Hello, Satan!"
[OTH],Saddam...
[OTH],Us Jews don't believe in hell.
[OTH],But what if we're wrong?
[OTH],Let's go.
[OTH],...they've killed Kenny!
[OTH],He had sins that he didn't confess!
[OTH],"No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now."
[OTH],"Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!"
[OTH],"I love you, Satan."
[OTH],"I love you too, Saddam."
[OTH],Wuh?!
[OTH],"Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis."
[OTH],"Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie."
[OTH],"Oh, huhuh."
[OTH],"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?"
Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!"
[OTH],Go Fonz!!!
[OTH],Aaaaaa--
[OTH],And now the exciting conclusion of... South Park.
[OTH],—aaaaaayy-err. No! No! No! No!
[OTH],I told him he couldn't do it.
Cartman,"I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh!"
[OTH],"You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman. Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone."
[OTH],"Boopie-kins. It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie."
[OTH],"Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school."
[OTH],What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
[OTH],"Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever."
[OTH],"Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school."
Cartman,"Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was smacked down by the Lord-uh! God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh! But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides, so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya to this part hmya. Who will help us?"
[OTH],I will.
Cartman,Praise God-uh!
[OTH],"If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris. Chris has been so nice to me and I know Saddam will just hurt me again. M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam. I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need closure. What am I doing?"
[OTH],"What took yo so long, baby?"
[OTH],"Saddam, I'm just here to talk."
[OTH],"Great! Let's talk! Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy."
[OTH],"Saddam, I only came here because I need closure."
[OTH],"Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything."
[OTH],"No! Saddam, listen to me."
[OTH],Would you like a drink?
[OTH],"Um, maybe just... a little one. I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore. I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now. What is this?"
[OTH],These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
[OTH],"Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now."
[OTH],"Really? So then... What are you doing here? Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!"
[OTH],Saddam...
[OTH],"Here, have another drink."
[OTH],"Ooh, whoa... God, my head. Drank too much. Chris? Oh no!!"
[OTH],"Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil! Ewuh, I'm all greasy."
[OTH],"Oh God, what time is it?"
[OTH],Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
[OTH],"I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris."
[OTH],Screw him!!
[OTH],"No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation! I just don't know what I'm gonna say."
[OTH],I know how to solve this little problem.
[OTH],"We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula. We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination."
[OTH],Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus.
[OTH],'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus?
[OTH],(Ahow..!)
[OTH],"Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay?"
[OTH],Pienso que sí.
[OTH],"Well, here's fifty for the gas. Adios."
[OTH],(Where am I?)
[OTH],¿Qué?
[OTH],(Where am I?)
[OTH],¿Qué?
Cartman,This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
[OTH],There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
[OTH],"Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!"
[OTH],"Hello, boys."
[OTH],"Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!"
[OTH],"It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away. Just really quick; she says it's very important."
Cartman,"Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants."
[OTH],I sure hope this works.
[OTH],"Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise."
[OTH],"Wow, cool."
Cartman,"No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"This is a distraction from our work on the church! Do not think that you can tempt us with toys and new games and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with! Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh. Well, alrighty then."
[OTH],I... don't think it worked.
[OTH],Aww.
Cartman,"Let us get back to our work at the church. Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah. Hello?"
[OTH],"(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)"
Cartman,Oh my God!!
[OTH],What?
Cartman,It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
[OTH],Kenny?! What's he say?
[OTH],Ask him what hell is like.
Cartman,Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
[OTH],(Um...)
[OTH],"Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes."
[OTH],"Hey, you."
[OTH],"Hi, Chris."
[OTH],You... were out all night.
[OTH],"Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina."
[OTH],"Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Satan, I understand."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I still feel secure and safe with you.
[OTH],"Oh, n-no!"
[OTH],What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],"Well, what more do you want from me?"
[OTH],"Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say ""If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!"" or, or ""I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!"" or something?"
[OTH],"Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything."
[OTH],"Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake."
[OTH],Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.
[OTH],"Ah—I'm sorry, Chris, it's... it's not you, really, it's, it's me. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for some reason, I just can't accept that."
[OTH],"Die, pussy!"
[OTH],Agghhh!
[OTH],"Chris! Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!"
[OTH],There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
[OTH],No! Not like this..!
Cartman,"Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh. It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh. He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish."
[OTH],Wagghh..!
Cartman,"He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!"
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,"And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!"
[OTH],Wagghh!
[OTH],Where is our daughter?
[OTH],Dad?
[OTH],Marcy! You're coming home this instant!
Cartman,"We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh!"
[OTH],You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
Cartman,"Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!"
[OTH],You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that-- Aagghh--!
[OTH],"Stephen? Stephen, no!"
Cartman,"The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!"
[OTH],"Forgive us, Lord."
Cartman,"Let us pray. Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry."
[OTH],Stephen? Stephen?
[OTH],Where... where am I?
[OTH],Where are we?
[OTH],No doubt about it...
[OTH],What's happening??
[OTH],Oooooooooh!
[OTH],"Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody hear me? Hello? Can everyb--? Okay. Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks like we have about 8,615 of you newbies today, and for those of you who are a little confused, uh, you are dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now going to start the orientation process, which will last about--"
[OTH],"Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven!"
[OTH],"Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong."
[OTH],I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.
[OTH],"Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well."
[OTH],"Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?"
[OTH],"I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan."
[OTH],Oooyeah!
[OTH],Aaggghh!
[OTH],"Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh... muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry."
[OTH],"Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims..."
[OTH],Satan! 'Scuse me. Excuse me.
[OTH],Chris! But I thought you were dead!
[OTH],"Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
[OTH],"Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in--"
[OTH],"Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?"
[OTH],Uh... yeah. Gr-great.
[OTH],Awww.
Cartman,"Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting."
[OTH],"Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you."
Cartman,"Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon."
[OTH],"Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives."
Cartman,"Sister, have you read this book?"
[OTH],"Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have."
Cartman,Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
[OTH],"Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives."
Cartman,Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
[OTH],No.
Cartman,"We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus!"
[OTH],Uugh..! Wait a minute. That's it.
[OTH],...And I'm gonna save all of you right now. I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.
Cartman,Well...
[OTH],"Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!"
[OTH],Yeah. It's me.
[OTH],I thought I killed you!
[OTH],Yeah...
[OTH],"Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
[OTH],"Right, right."
[OTH],Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
[OTH],A walk?
[OTH],Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
[OTH],Is this some kind of trick?
[OTH],"No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?"
[OTH],"Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick. Okay, let's walk."
[OTH],"Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much."
[OTH],"Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?"
[OTH],"Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them."
[OTH],"You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy!"
[OTH],Agghhh! Oh God!
[OTH],Ah hahaha!
[OTH],Nooo! Agh!
[OTH],Aggghhh!
[OTH],Ow! Goo-aagh..!
Cartman,"Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?"
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,"That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh! Theah!"
[OTH],Ow!
Cartman,Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
[OTH],"Uh, I think so."
Cartman,Praise the Lord-uh!
[OTH],Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise God!
Cartman,"For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person! This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!"
[OTH],Huh-Hallelujah!
[OTH],Timmiiiy!
Cartman,We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
[OTH],Timmiiiy!
Cartman,Devil be gone-uh!
[OTH],Haagggh.
Cartman,"Now walk, Timmih!"
[OTH],Haagggh.
Cartman,"Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!"
[OTH],Haghh.
Cartman,"The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih!"
[OTH],Timmilih?
Cartman,He walks-uh!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Oh-aagghhh!
Cartman,Yes! Praise the Lord!
[OTH],Praise the Lord!
[OTH],"And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all."
[OTH],"Wow, that really sucks."
[OTH],"I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer."
[OTH],"Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],God.
[OTH],"God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years."
[OTH],"Well then, maybe it's time."
[OTH],Do dodo dum do dodoDo dodo dum do dodo
Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy?"
[OTH],Denver.
Cartman,And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
[OTH],"Yeah, that's right."
[OTH],Wooooo!
Cartman,"Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone!"
[OTH],Aghh...
[OTH],Hooray!
Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!"
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at! Bah!
[OTH],Wagh...
Cartman,"Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say ""Amen!"""
[OTH],Amen!
[OTH],"Lord, Lord, Lord"
[OTH],"Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!"
[OTH],"Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by."
[OTH],"Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades."
[OTH],Alright. Yeah.
[OTH],"And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie."
[OTH],Ooooh!
[OTH],Yeahahah!
[OTH],"Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?"
[OTH],Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there.
[OTH],I'm so grateful for that.
[OTH],"Me, too. Uh huh."
[OTH],Great. Thanks.
[OTH],Ah... Hello? G-God? It's uh... Satan.
[OTH],"Yea. Look upon me, and know me."
[OTH],"Hi, God."
[OTH],"Hello, Satan. It's... been a long time."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?
[OTH],"No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice."
[OTH],You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
[OTH],"No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April..."
Cartman,"Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah, and putting a dollar in the box-ah! Come on, don't be shy! Come on now!"
[OTH],"Dude, that seems kind of... weird."
[OTH],Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
[OTH],...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.
[OTH],"Jesus, what the hell happened to you?"
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.
[OTH],"Well, I just don't know which one to pick."
[OTH],"No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them. And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist."
[OTH],"God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself."
[OTH],Bingo.
[OTH],"Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes."
[OTH],"It was nice to see you again, Satan."
[OTH],You too.
[OTH],Goodbye.
[OTH],Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch?
[OTH],"Yes, would you?"
[OTH],"Uh, no, I need to be getting back."
[OTH],"Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play."
[OTH],Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life.
[OTH],"Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really gotta go."
[OTH],"Well, he seemed like a nice fellow."
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Let's go make things out of egg cartons.
[OTH],"Oooh, yeah. I'll do that."
Cartman,"Yeess. Yeess. It worked, you guys, it actually worked!"
[OTH],What worked?
Cartman,Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],You're keeping that money yourself?
Cartman,"Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars! Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route."
[OTH],Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
Cartman,"It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school."
[OTH],"Well, what about going to hell and all that?!"
Cartman,"Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that."
[OTH],Then why didn't you tell us?!
Cartman,"My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!"
[OTH],The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
Cartman,Suck my balls!
[OTH],"Dude, I am so disillusioned right now."
[OTH],"Die, pussy!"
[OTH],Ow..!
[OTH],Aagghh!
[OTH],Aagghh!
[OTH],"Guys, guys, guys! Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision."
[OTH],You have?
[OTH],Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want. So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself."
[OTH],Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
[OTH],"No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!"
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you!"
Cartman,Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh!
[OTH],"Alright kids, it's time to go. It's time for this to stop!"
Cartman,Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
[OTH],I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else.
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],Jesus!
Cartman,Uh-oh.
[OTH],"Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school."
Cartman,"Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay."
[OTH],"God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him."
Cartman,"Ee-yes, by doing that, and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!"
[OTH],Let's go ice-skating.
[OTH],Yea!
[OTH],"Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"No, come back! You face everlasting damnation! Wait! No! No! I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!"
[OTH],"Serves you right, Cartman!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!"
Cartman,You're gonna send me to hell?
[OTH],No. Worse!
[OTH],(Eric! Eric!)
Cartman,"Aw, crap!"
[OTH],"Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick."
[OTH],"Hi, Satan."
[OTH],There you are!
[OTH],Awgh... Not again.
[OTH],You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
[OTH],"Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore!"
[OTH],"You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me."
[OTH],"Yes, I can! Raaarrr!"
[OTH],"Aw, you little..prick!"
[OTH],"Goodbye forever, Saddam!"
[OTH],"What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow."
[OTH],Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.
[OTH],Let me in where?
[OTH],"What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!"
[OTH],"Hello, and welcome."
[OTH],"We're glad you made it, brother."
[OTH],"Ey, who the hell are you?"
[OTH],"We're just about to do a play, about how much stealing hurts you deep inside. Come join us."
[OTH],Yes. Come on. Let's go.
[OTH],You're here forever.
[OTH],Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!
[OTH],"Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade."
[OTH],Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders!
[OTH],"Get out of my way, you little dorks!"
[OTH],"Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!"
[OTH],"Yeah, but now, we're fifth-graders, you stupid fourth-graders, so move it!"
[OTH],"Ungh, gay, dude."
[OTH],"Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up. Hey, come here"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What grade are you going into?
[OTH],Thi-ird
[OTH],Stupid third grader!
Cartman,"Yeah, get out of here!"
[OTH],Uhuhuhow.
Cartman,"There, that's better."
[OTH],"You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver."
[OTH],Denver?
Cartman,"U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her."
[OTH],He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship!
[OTH],"Alright. Hey, listen up everybody! We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical!"
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],"Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together!"
[OTH],YEAH!!!
Cartman,"Why, that's PERfect!"
[OTH],"Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down, should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?"
[OTH],"...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters."
[OTH],"Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl."
[OTH],...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
[OTH],"Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"""
[OTH],Together we are strong!
[OTH],YEAH!!!
[OTH],"Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down."
[OTH],"We got you covered, Timmy."
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?"
[OTH],"Huhuh, look at all this stuff."
Cartman,"Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?"
[OTH],"Dude, look at the walls. Everything is written in some strange, foreign language."
[OTH],"Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome to the fourth grade."
[OTH],"Holy God, dude!"
[OTH],(Those titties are fuckin' huge!)
[OTH],My name is Ms. Choksondik.
[OTH],"...More like, Ms. Makes-me-sick."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?! I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade! And it is time to go to work!"
Cartman,"KISS MY ASS!!! Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak."
[OTH],"Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this."
Cartman,"Oh, I'm sure I do."
[OTH],This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up!
Cartman,I'm trying.
[OTH],"Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class."
Cartman,"Fantastic, then."
[OTH],"Now, let us begin our first-day exam. SILENCE!"
[OTH],What a bitch!
[OTH],And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
Cartman,You guys are all such pussies!
[OTH],"I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!"
[OTH],This is it. The end of innocence. This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents warned us about.
[OTH],I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Cartman,Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was. Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue We had warm cookies and hearts full of love And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you... There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute To Third Grade"
[OTH],Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
[OTH],Huh-it sure was.
Cartman,I wish I was still there.
[OTH],"Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!"
[OTH],How?
[OTH],We travel back in time.
[OTH],"Oh yeah, time travel."
[OTH],Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt? I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
[OTH],It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it."
[OTH],"Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement."
Cartman,"Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!"
[OTH],"When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-"
Cartman,"Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade."
[OTH],"Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back."
[OTH],"We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],So can you do it?
[OTH],"It's all theoretical, but from a scientific standpoint, the creation of a rip in space-time is possible. We just need to find an inertia device."
[OTH],Heeeyyy. This kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need.
[OTH],Tuh-timmih?
[OTH],"Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!"
[OTH],What's the problem?
[OTH],"Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra."
[OTH],You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
[OTH],"No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay."
[OTH],"Principal Victoria, I would like a word!"
[OTH],Oooo! Call the doctor!
[OTH],"My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!"
[OTH],"Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade."
[OTH],"One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake!"
[OTH],Oh? Which one?
[OTH],"The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?!"
[OTH],I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
[OTH],Why?! Where did he go?!
[OTH],We... don't like to talk about it.
[OTH],But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with God as my witness-
[OTH],Aww Oooo!
[OTH],"I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top! I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!"
[OTH],"Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then."
[OTH],"Alright, when we power up, the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way , then make the required magnetic vibrations."
[OTH],"If the fields are right, it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom."
[OTH],"You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?"
[OTH],"Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it."
[OTH],"And on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot, only one year ago."
[OTH],Back in the third grade.
[OTH],Cool/Wow.
[OTH],"I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Oh! Here she comes.
[OTH],"Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh."
Cartman,"Suck my balls!!! Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-"
[OTH],"I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!"
Cartman,"We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makes-me-sick! We didn't feel like it!"
[OTH],It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!
Cartman,"Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen?"
[OTH],Primary fusion initiated.
[OTH],Molecular grenadine active.
[OTH],Aa-aa-ah!
[OTH],What are you doing?!
Cartman,"We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa!"
[OTH],Timmaaaaaaaaah! Timmaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],I didn't think it would work.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],"Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!"
Cartman,You're damn right they do!
[OTH],Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],"Children! Children, come back here!"
[OTH],"Timmy, you have to stop!"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],No??
[OTH],"Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high."
[OTH],What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],No??
[OTH],"We've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight. If he gets off, the whole thing blows!"
[OTH],"So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?"
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],My God!
[OTH],It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives.
[OTH],"Over here, over here!"
[OTH],"The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device."
[OTH],Timmi-hih-ih!
[OTH],"Closer! Don't worry, son. Just watch your speed and stay still!"
[OTH],"Look out, Hansen!"
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Timmaaay!
[OTH],"Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, what's going on?"
[OTH],"Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode!"
[OTH],What?! AAAH!! Omigod! Omigod!
[OTH],It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5!
[OTH],O-kay. O-kay. Omigod.
[OTH],Tih-Timmah?
[OTH],Okay. I kept the speed at 5.
[OTH],Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at?
[OTH],Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes!
[OTH],Less than 20 minutes?!
[OTH],Oh no! What have we done?!
[OTH],Whattaya think? Too forward?
[OTH],I HAVE HAD IT!!!
[OTH],Waaah!
[OTH],"These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],"As we said before, that's impossible."
[OTH],What in God's name happened to him?
[OTH],"Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts."
[OTH],And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
[OTH],"After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn."
[OTH],He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
[OTH],"Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', ""I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"""
[OTH],Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!
[OTH],"And, nobody has found him?"
[OTH],"Well, we really haven't ll-looked."
[OTH],I see. Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!
[OTH],But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
[OTH],"Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up and up and up!"
[OTH],NOOO!!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Oh my God, Oh my God!"
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death. Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here."
[OTH],"Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-"
[OTH],"Ah, please help!"
[OTH],Which just turned into a time bomb.
[OTH],Please help.
[OTH],This has never happened in all the 72 original Star Trek episodes.
[OTH],"Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes."
[OTH],"...No, there were 72."
[OTH],No there weren't!
[OTH],"Oh, you are such a nerd!"
[OTH],"Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device."
[OTH],"It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine."
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready?"
[OTH],"(Yes, sir!)"
[OTH],Go below!
[OTH],(Hi guys.) (Uh oh.) (Uff. I'm okay.) (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!)
[OTH],"Well, who didn't see that coming?"
[OTH],Oh my God! Oh my God!
[OTH],Stay calm! You have to stay calm!
[OTH],But if we got off the chair it blows up!
[OTH],"No no, that's only if the boy gets off."
[OTH],Oh. See ya!
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"Ten seconds, Hansen!"
[OTH],"...nine, eight..."
[OTH],Please-a help me.
[OTH],"...six, five..."
[OTH],Please help me. Please help me.
[OTH],"Got it! I think! Up, up!"
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],"Hey, it did work."
[OTH],"Hello-oo-ooo. Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed. Is anyone here? Mister? Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
[OTH],I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help. Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.
[OTH],"No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!"
[OTH],"Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?"
[OTH],Choksondik.
[OTH],"No, I don't! IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!"
[OTH],...Two hundred bucks.
[OTH],...Done.
[OTH],Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
[OTH],Huh? Oh... Can't.
[OTH],"What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one!"
[OTH],"I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!"
[OTH],W-what did you get in a fight about?
[OTH],There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72!
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!"
[OTH],No! He actually thinks there's 72.!
Cartman,"Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?"
[OTH],"No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom's. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's wrong..."
[OTH],"Alright, come on, guys. Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!"
[OTH],Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
[OTH],Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!
[OTH],"Alright, let's try it again."
[OTH],"""Children, we are now going to do math problems."""
[OTH],"""But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."""
[OTH],"""Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!"""
[OTH],"""Well, I'm not gong'  to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"""
[OTH],"""Don't use that kind of language, young man!"""
[OTH],NOOO!
[OTH],No??
[OTH],"Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, ""Suck my balls,"" you say, ""Present them."""
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Now, let's try it again. SUCK MY BALLS!"
[OTH],Pre-sent them?
[OTH],"Good. Very good. You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons."
[OTH],I'm ready. I'm not afraid.
[OTH],You will be! You will be! You will be.
[OTH],"God-damnit, this is ridiculous."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?"
[OTH],"Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! ""The Menagerie"" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!"
Cartman,Who the hell cares?!
[OTH],I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!
[OTH],Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
[OTH],"No, because he's WRONG!"
[OTH],"Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!"
[OTH],And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don't think so! I don't want to live in that world.
Cartman,"God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!"
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],"Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that ""The Menagerie"" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha. Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses."
[OTH],Wait a minute! I've got it.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!"
[OTH],"Dude, Jesus, you're right."
[OTH],This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
[OTH],What lives inside?
[OTH],Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.
[OTH],"Oh, alrighty. What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side! There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here. Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids! I think I get it now!"
[OTH],"Hey, hurry up in there! Jesus. You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight! You in there?! Hey, where the hell did she go? What the? Haaa! Who? Who are you?"
[OTH],I am you. I am your gay side.
[OTH],"My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!!"
[OTH],You must face me at last.
[OTH],You aren't real! You can't be!
[OTH],"It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate."
[OTH],What do you want?
[OTH],"I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Don't you see? All these years, your pain, your confusion, it comes from one place. Your denial of who you are. Of who... we are."
[OTH],But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!
[OTH],"Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?!"
[OTH],I was just comparing size!
[OTH],For seven minutes?!
[OTH],Aaa!
[OTH],And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?!
[OTH],I was beating off to the chicks!
[OTH],THERE WERE NO CHICKS!
[OTH],"OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!"
[OTH],ADMIT IT!
[OTH],NO!!!
[OTH],YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND GET A G-
[OTH],"ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY!!! I'm...gay. I'm gay! I am gay! You hear that everyone? I'm gay! I'm gay! I'm gay and it... and it feels good."
[OTH],"Alright, children, I hope you all did your- Oowhat is going on now?!"
Cartman,"Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me."
[OTH],"Oh Good Gravy, not this again."
Cartman,"Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen?"
[OTH],"Children, I will have order!!"
[OTH],I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to tell you how WRONG you are! Just like when you said there were no two-parters of Battlestar Galactica!
[OTH],There WEREN'T!
[OTH],"The episode called ""Gonzo on Ice Planet Zero"" was a two-parter."
[OTH],No it WASN'T!
[OTH],"Oh, son of a bitch!"
[OTH],I'll kill you!
Cartman,"There it is! Come on, everybody!"
[OTH],"Children, get back into your seats!"
Cartman,"No way, lady!"
[OTH],"Eric, I mean it!"
Cartman,You can suck my balls!
[OTH],Present them.
Cartman,...What?
[OTH],"You said, ""suck my balls."" Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em."
[OTH],Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
Cartman,"Touché, teacher. Touché."
[OTH],"Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?"
[OTH],Dude. Sh-she's right.
[OTH],"Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either."
[OTH],"Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!"
[OTH],"Yeah! You suck, Cartman!"
Cartman,What??
[OTH],"Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade."
[OTH],AAAAAAA!
[OTH],"Hey, Timmy's back!"
[OTH],"Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us."
[OTH],"Eh, Timmih."
[OTH],"You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria."
[OTH],"Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!!"
[OTH],Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
[OTH],You admit it? You admit it!
[OTH],"Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!"
[OTH],"Yeah, it feels really good!"
[OTH],"Well, congratulations!"
[OTH],"Yeah, congratulations!"
[OTH],"You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!"
[OTH],"Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people."
[OTH],"Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade."
[OTH],Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders!
[OTH],"Get out of my way, you little dorks!"
[OTH],"Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!"
[OTH],"Yeah, but now, we're fifth-graders, you stupid fourth-graders, so move it!"
[OTH],"Ungh, gay, dude."
[OTH],"Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up. Hey, come here"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What grade are you going into?
[OTH],Thi-ird
[OTH],Stupid third grader!
Cartman,"Yeah, get out of here!"
[OTH],Uhuhuhow.
Cartman,"There, that's better."
[OTH],"You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver."
[OTH],Denver?
Cartman,"U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her."
[OTH],He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship!
[OTH],"Alright. Hey, listen up everybody! We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical!"
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],"Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together!"
[OTH],YEAH!!!
Cartman,"Why, that's PERfect!"
[OTH],"Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down, should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?"
[OTH],"...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters."
[OTH],"Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl."
[OTH],...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
[OTH],"Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"""
[OTH],Together we are strong!
[OTH],YEAH!!!
[OTH],"Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down."
[OTH],"We got you covered, Timmy."
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?"
[OTH],"Huhuh, look at all this stuff."
Cartman,"Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?"
[OTH],"Dude, look at the walls. Everything is written in some strange, foreign language."
[OTH],"Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome to the fourth grade."
[OTH],"Holy God, dude!"
[OTH],(Those titties are fuckin' huge!)
[OTH],My name is Ms. Choksondik.
[OTH],"...More like, Ms. Makes-me-sick."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?! I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade! And it is time to go to work!"
Cartman,"KISS MY ASS!!! Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak."
[OTH],"Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this."
Cartman,"Oh, I'm sure I do."
[OTH],This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up!
Cartman,I'm trying.
[OTH],"Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class."
Cartman,"Fantastic, then."
[OTH],"Now, let us begin our first-day exam. SILENCE!"
[OTH],What a bitch!
[OTH],And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
Cartman,You guys are all such pussies!
[OTH],"I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!"
[OTH],This is it. The end of innocence. This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents warned us about.
[OTH],I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Cartman,Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was. Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue We had warm cookies and hearts full of love And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you... There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute To Third Grade"
[OTH],Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
[OTH],Huh-it sure was.
Cartman,I wish I was still there.
[OTH],"Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!"
[OTH],How?
[OTH],We travel back in time.
[OTH],"Oh yeah, time travel."
[OTH],Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt? I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
[OTH],It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it."
[OTH],"Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement."
Cartman,"Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!"
[OTH],"When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-"
Cartman,"Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade."
[OTH],"Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back."
[OTH],"We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],So can you do it?
[OTH],"It's all theoretical, but from a scientific standpoint, the creation of a rip in space-time is possible. We just need to find an inertia device."
[OTH],Heeeyyy. This kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need.
[OTH],Tuh-timmih?
[OTH],"Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!"
[OTH],What's the problem?
[OTH],"Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra."
[OTH],You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
[OTH],"No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay."
[OTH],"Principal Victoria, I would like a word!"
[OTH],Oooo! Call the doctor!
[OTH],"My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!"
[OTH],"Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade."
[OTH],"One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake!"
[OTH],Oh? Which one?
[OTH],"The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?!"
[OTH],I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
[OTH],Why?! Where did he go?!
[OTH],We... don't like to talk about it.
[OTH],But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with God as my witness-
[OTH],Aww Oooo!
[OTH],"I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top! I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!"
[OTH],"Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then."
[OTH],"Alright, when we power up, the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way , then make the required magnetic vibrations."
[OTH],"If the fields are right, it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom."
[OTH],"You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?"
[OTH],"Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it."
[OTH],"And on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot, only one year ago."
[OTH],Back in the third grade.
[OTH],Cool/Wow.
[OTH],"I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Oh! Here she comes.
[OTH],"Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh."
Cartman,"Suck my balls!!! Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-"
[OTH],"I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!"
Cartman,"We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makes-me-sick! We didn't feel like it!"
[OTH],It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!
Cartman,"Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen?"
[OTH],Primary fusion initiated.
[OTH],Molecular grenadine active.
[OTH],Aa-aa-ah!
[OTH],What are you doing?!
Cartman,"We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa!"
[OTH],Timmaaaaaaaaah! Timmaaaaaaaaah!
[OTH],I didn't think it would work.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],"Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!"
Cartman,You're damn right they do!
[OTH],Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],"Children! Children, come back here!"
[OTH],"Timmy, you have to stop!"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],No??
[OTH],"Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high."
[OTH],What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],No??
[OTH],"We've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight. If he gets off, the whole thing blows!"
[OTH],"So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?"
[OTH],Yup.
[OTH],My God!
[OTH],It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives.
[OTH],"Over here, over here!"
[OTH],"The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device."
[OTH],Timmi-hih-ih!
[OTH],"Closer! Don't worry, son. Just watch your speed and stay still!"
[OTH],"Look out, Hansen!"
[OTH],Oh!
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],Timmaaay!
[OTH],"Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, what's going on?"
[OTH],"Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode!"
[OTH],What?! AAAH!! Omigod! Omigod!
[OTH],It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5!
[OTH],O-kay. O-kay. Omigod.
[OTH],Tih-Timmah?
[OTH],Okay. I kept the speed at 5.
[OTH],Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at?
[OTH],Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes!
[OTH],Less than 20 minutes?!
[OTH],Oh no! What have we done?!
[OTH],Whattaya think? Too forward?
[OTH],I HAVE HAD IT!!!
[OTH],Waaah!
[OTH],"These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison!"
[OTH],"As we said before, that's impossible."
[OTH],What in God's name happened to him?
[OTH],"Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts."
[OTH],And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
[OTH],"After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn."
[OTH],He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
[OTH],"Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', ""I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"""
[OTH],Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!
[OTH],"And, nobody has found him?"
[OTH],"Well, we really haven't ll-looked."
[OTH],I see. Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!
[OTH],But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
[OTH],"Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up and up and up!"
[OTH],NOOO!!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Oh my God, Oh my God!"
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death. Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here."
[OTH],"Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-"
[OTH],"Ah, please help!"
[OTH],Which just turned into a time bomb.
[OTH],Please help.
[OTH],This has never happened in all the 72 original Star Trek episodes.
[OTH],"Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes."
[OTH],"...No, there were 72."
[OTH],No there weren't!
[OTH],"Oh, you are such a nerd!"
[OTH],"Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device."
[OTH],"It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine."
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready?"
[OTH],"(Yes, sir!)"
[OTH],Go below!
[OTH],(Hi guys.) (Uh oh.) (Uff. I'm okay.) (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!)
[OTH],"Well, who didn't see that coming?"
[OTH],Oh my God! Oh my God!
[OTH],Stay calm! You have to stay calm!
[OTH],But if we got off the chair it blows up!
[OTH],"No no, that's only if the boy gets off."
[OTH],Oh. See ya!
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"Ten seconds, Hansen!"
[OTH],"...nine, eight..."
[OTH],Please-a help me.
[OTH],"...six, five..."
[OTH],Please help me. Please help me.
[OTH],"Got it! I think! Up, up!"
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],"Hey, it did work."
[OTH],"Hello-oo-ooo. Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed. Is anyone here? Mister? Mr. Garrison?"
[OTH],Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
[OTH],I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help. Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.
[OTH],"No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months."
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!"
[OTH],"Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?"
[OTH],Choksondik.
[OTH],"No, I don't! IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!"
[OTH],"Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!"
[OTH],...Two hundred bucks.
[OTH],...Done.
[OTH],Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
[OTH],Huh? Oh... Can't.
[OTH],"What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one!"
[OTH],"I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!"
[OTH],W-what did you get in a fight about?
[OTH],There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72!
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!"
[OTH],No! He actually thinks there's 72.!
Cartman,"Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?"
[OTH],"No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom's. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's wrong..."
[OTH],"Alright, come on, guys. Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!"
[OTH],Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
[OTH],Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!
[OTH],"Alright, let's try it again."
[OTH],"""Children, we are now going to do math problems."""
[OTH],"""But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."""
[OTH],"""Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!"""
[OTH],"""Well, I'm not gong'  to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"""
[OTH],"""Don't use that kind of language, young man!"""
[OTH],NOOO!
[OTH],No??
[OTH],"Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, ""Suck my balls,"" you say, ""Present them."""
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Now, let's try it again. SUCK MY BALLS!"
[OTH],Pre-sent them?
[OTH],"Good. Very good. You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons."
[OTH],I'm ready. I'm not afraid.
[OTH],You will be! You will be! You will be.
[OTH],"God-damnit, this is ridiculous."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?"
[OTH],"Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! ""The Menagerie"" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!"
Cartman,Who the hell cares?!
[OTH],I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!
[OTH],Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
[OTH],"No, because he's WRONG!"
[OTH],"Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!"
[OTH],And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don't think so! I don't want to live in that world.
Cartman,"God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!"
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],"Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that ""The Menagerie"" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha. Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses."
[OTH],Wait a minute! I've got it.
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],"Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!"
[OTH],"Dude, Jesus, you're right."
[OTH],This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
[OTH],What lives inside?
[OTH],Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.
[OTH],"Oh, alrighty. What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side! There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here. Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids! I think I get it now!"
[OTH],"Hey, hurry up in there! Jesus. You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight! You in there?! Hey, where the hell did she go? What the? Haaa! Who? Who are you?"
[OTH],I am you. I am your gay side.
[OTH],"My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!!"
[OTH],You must face me at last.
[OTH],You aren't real! You can't be!
[OTH],"It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate."
[OTH],What do you want?
[OTH],"I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Don't you see? All these years, your pain, your confusion, it comes from one place. Your denial of who you are. Of who... we are."
[OTH],But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!
[OTH],"Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?!"
[OTH],I was just comparing size!
[OTH],For seven minutes?!
[OTH],Aaa!
[OTH],And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?!
[OTH],I was beating off to the chicks!
[OTH],THERE WERE NO CHICKS!
[OTH],"OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!"
[OTH],ADMIT IT!
[OTH],NO!!!
[OTH],YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND GET A G-
[OTH],"ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY!!! I'm...gay. I'm gay! I am gay! You hear that everyone? I'm gay! I'm gay! I'm gay and it... and it feels good."
[OTH],"Alright, children, I hope you all did your- Oowhat is going on now?!"
Cartman,"Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me."
[OTH],"Oh Good Gravy, not this again."
Cartman,"Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen?"
[OTH],"Children, I will have order!!"
[OTH],I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to tell you how WRONG you are! Just like when you said there were no two-parters of Battlestar Galactica!
[OTH],There WEREN'T!
[OTH],"The episode called ""Gonzo on Ice Planet Zero"" was a two-parter."
[OTH],No it WASN'T!
[OTH],"Oh, son of a bitch!"
[OTH],I'll kill you!
Cartman,"There it is! Come on, everybody!"
[OTH],"Children, get back into your seats!"
Cartman,"No way, lady!"
[OTH],"Eric, I mean it!"
Cartman,You can suck my balls!
[OTH],Present them.
Cartman,...What?
[OTH],"You said, ""suck my balls."" Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em."
[OTH],Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
Cartman,"Touché, teacher. Touché."
[OTH],"Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?"
[OTH],Dude. Sh-she's right.
[OTH],"Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either."
[OTH],"Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!"
[OTH],"Yeah! You suck, Cartman!"
Cartman,What??
[OTH],"Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade."
[OTH],AAAAAAA!
[OTH],"Hey, Timmy's back!"
[OTH],"Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us."
[OTH],"Eh, Timmih."
[OTH],"You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria."
[OTH],"Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!!"
[OTH],Mr. Garrison?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
[OTH],You admit it? You admit it!
[OTH],"Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!"
[OTH],"Yeah, it feels really good!"
[OTH],"Well, congratulations!"
[OTH],"Yeah, congratulations!"
[OTH],"You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!"
[OTH],"Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people."
[OTH],"Dude, what's your little brother doing here?"
[OTH],Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
[OTH],But isn't he only three years old?
[OTH],"Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten."
[OTH],I pooped my pants.
[OTH],"But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper. It has five different compartments for each subject in school, and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek."
[OTH],Cool!
Cartman,"Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000. Yeah, well, it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's, flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar."
[OTH],"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!"
Cartman,"Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase."
[OTH],He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
Cartman,He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
[OTH],I pooped my pants!
[OTH],"He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--"
Cartman,"Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume."
[OTH],"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus."
[OTH],Sit down and shut up!!
[OTH],But they smell like pee.
[OTH],I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.
[OTH],You are?
[OTH],Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.
[OTH],Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
[OTH],"I was held back ten human grades. I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?"
Cartman,"Yeah, that's me."
[OTH],Eric Cartman? And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?
Cartman,"Yeahhh, you already know about it?"
[OTH],"Yes. Yes, I do."
Cartman,"Well... ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"""
[OTH],I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
[OTH],"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?"
[OTH],"No, I don't! I don't care!"
Cartman,"Here, Kyle."
[OTH],"Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius."
[OTH],"Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten."
[OTH],"Come on. So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5?"
[OTH],Unkoo baba.
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's take our seats. My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little ""nervous breakdown"" and went into the mountains where I lived off of ""rat carcasses"". But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten. But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it? No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?"
[OTH],Here.
[OTH],Sally Bands?
[OTH],Here.
[OTH],Ike Broflovski?
[OTH],Cookie Monster.
[OTH],"Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too. Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve."
Cartman,And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically. I can take something as simple as this calculator and... Trapper Keeper?
[OTH],Trapper Keeper active.
Cartman,Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
[OTH],Ready for hybrid.
Cartman,"And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too."
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],May I hold your Trapper Keeper?
Cartman,"Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers. If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands."
[OTH],"Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!"
Cartman,"Oh really? Then, why don't you hold it? Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it. Hold it."
[OTH],I'm gonna!
Cartman,Hold it.
[OTH],I will!
[OTH],"And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better. Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president, so first we must pick nominees. Who would like to nominate someone?"
[OTH],"I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class."
[OTH],"Okay, Filmore. You'll be our first nominee. And who else? Yes, Jenny."
[OTH],I gotta go doodie.
[OTH],"In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president? Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius."
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius. Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?"
[OTH],"If I'm elected class president, I'll call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays, I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank you."
[OTH],"Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you?"
[OTH],Cookie Monster. Ice.
[OTH],"...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids."
[OTH],"Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid."
[OTH],"Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend? I mean, friend?"
Cartman,"I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once."
[OTH],"Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square-- I mean, four square."
Cartman,"Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me."
[OTH],"Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!"
Cartman,"Okay, that's cool."
[OTH],Can we play some human tetherball?
Cartman,"A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some--"
[OTH],Serve!
Cartman,Ugh..!
[OTH],Got it!
Cartman,Ey!
[OTH],Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper!
[OTH],Waa-agggh!
Cartman,"You son of a bitch! Wait a minute. Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device."
[OTH],What the hell just happened?
[OTH],Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
[OTH],"So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike. And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for. You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?"
[OTH],I don't know...
[OTH],"Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?"
[OTH],"Um, I vote for... I don't know."
[OTH],"Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Flora, just say you vote for Filmore so we can all go home."
[OTH],Um...
[OTH],No! You want Ike to be president.
[OTH],We're gonna be here all night! Why don't you guys just concede?
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Why don't you just concede?
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Filmore!
[OTH],Ike!
[OTH],I want Ike to be president!
[OTH],"Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!"
Cartman,Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
[OTH],"Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder."
Cartman,"It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if-- There he is!"
[OTH],Wagh!
Cartman,Got ya!
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],Gaagghhh!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude..!"
Cartman,"Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?"
[OTH],Please. You do not understand.
Cartman,"Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done."
[OTH],That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!
[OTH],"Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?"
[OTH],Bill Cosby?
[OTH],Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby. My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.
[OTH],"Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!"
[OTH],"I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world. It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind and there was nothing the humans could do. It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans. The nations tried everything to stop it. Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked. The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them. But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper. And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started."
[OTH],"Wow, that's amazing."
[OTH],"Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast."
[OTH],"What do you think, Officer Barbrady?"
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening."
[OTH],"And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper."
Cartman,You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
[OTH],"Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!"
Cartman,"What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!"
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,"Aw, damnit! Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes!"
[OTH],I decided.
[OTH],"Oh, thank God, Flora! Alright, who do you vote for?"
[OTH],Umm... Ike.
[OTH],Yay!
[OTH],"Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president."
[OTH],We want a recount.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!
[OTH],"Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby! Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore... ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike."
[OTH],Count them again.
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!"
[OTH],"Wait, there's still that absent kid."
[OTH],"Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for his vote."
[OTH],"Oh, will you grow up?!"
[OTH],Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Absent kids count!
[OTH],"Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home!"
[OTH],"Good morning, humans."
[OTH],"Hey, Bill Cosby."
[OTH],"I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada."
[OTH],That should do it.
[OTH],"So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?"
[OTH],"Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right."
Cartman,"Hey, dudes."
[OTH],Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
Cartman,"Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one! So everything worked out."
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],"Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!"
Cartman,Why the hell not?!
[OTH],"Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!"
Cartman,Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
[OTH],We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
Cartman,But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
[OTH],"Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!"
Cartman,"Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,Ech! Screw you guys. Home.
[OTH],"Well, that does it!"
[OTH],Hey! What are you doing?
[OTH],"I'm afraid I have no other choice. For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him."
[OTH],Oh... Okay.
[OTH],"Yeah, that's fine. No, wait!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Can I do it?
[OTH],"Oh, well, I suppose."
[OTH],"Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!"
[OTH],"Wait! Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother."
[OTH],"Well, yeah, or we could just kill him."
[OTH],"Yeah, that'd be faster."
[OTH],He's right there.
[OTH],"I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call ""compassion"". It is an amazing feeling!"
[OTH],Awww..!
[OTH],"Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris? Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung. Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for... Filmore."
[OTH],Yay./Hooray.
[OTH],Wait one minute!
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ."
[OTH],I think the ballot were misleading. Some kids didn't understand whom they were voting for.
[OTH],There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?
[OTH],"You're just saying that, 'cause you know you're gonna lose now."
[OTH],"No, I'm saying that because you are a boogerface!"
[OTH],"Well, just you wait, 'cause my famous aunt is on huh way right now."
[OTH],Who's your famous aunt?
[OTH],"My aunt Rosie, Rosie O'Donnell."
[OTH],Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here?
[OTH],"Yeah, she's very active in politics. So she's gonna set all this straight."
[OTH],Oh no..!
[OTH],Recharging.
Cartman,"Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--"
[OTH],Trapper Keeper ready to ensorb.
Cartman,"Oh, cool."
[OTH],"Trapper Keeper, merging."
Cartman,Whoa...
[OTH],"And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper. Not now! Not ever!"
[OTH],"Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness."
[OTH],Correct.
[OTH],"Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill."
[OTH],Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?
[OTH],"In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first?"
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],Here we go again.
[OTH],"Come this way, Billy."
[OTH],"Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves."
Cartman,"Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--"
[OTH],"Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper!"
Cartman,"Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--"
[OTH],"Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb."
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"Dammit, Cartman, open up!"
[OTH],"Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid."
Cartman,"Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now? Ugh--!"
[OTH],"Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom."
[OTH],Cartman? He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
[OTH],You break it down!
[OTH],"Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!"
[OTH],"Not it! You lose, Kenny."
[OTH],(Awww..!) (Argh--!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You ba--!
[OTH],Agggghhh!
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!"
[OTH],"What the hell is that? Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom! Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door."
[OTH],"Hello, kids!"
[OTH],Aunt Rosie!
[OTH],"Run for your lives, children! I'll try to fight it off!"
[OTH],"That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell."
[OTH],"Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well."
[OTH],"Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem?"
[OTH],Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president.
[OTH],"No, Ike won."
[OTH],"Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--"
[OTH],"Well it obviously isn't that simple, is it? I mean, you'd think a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this, but now we're gonna do it my way!"
[OTH],We are Trapper Keeper.
[OTH],Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!
[OTH],Why is that bad?
[OTH],It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!
[OTH],Then we have to stop it before it gets there!
[OTH],"Step on it, Bill Cosby!"
[OTH],"Hey, Mark, look."
[OTH],Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen.
[OTH],"Cartman, you have to stop!"
[OTH],We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.
[OTH],A part of your friend must still be alive in there.
[OTH],He is in there.
[OTH],"That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU."
[OTH],"One-two-three, not it!"
[OTH],"Not-- Aw, damnit..!"
Cartman,"What are you doing, Kyle?"
[OTH],"I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU."
Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle."
[OTH],"Screw you, fat ass!"
Cartman,"Hey, screw you."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,Agh--!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Okay, so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand, and after that, we're gonna go over the votes again manually, and then--"
[OTH],"Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it! Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year."
[OTH],We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated!
[OTH],"Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds! ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject there, kids."
[OTH],"How dare you! I will not be preached at by a country bumpkin! I'm leaving this Podunk town, but in my place I'm gonna send more lawyers, statesmen and press than you have ever seen!"
[OTH],"Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse."
[OTH],Aaghh!
[OTH],Wagghh!
[OTH],Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this. Car one to base-- Aghh!
[OTH],It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!
[OTH],Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
[OTH],I can't reach the CPU.
[OTH],What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!
[OTH],"Oh, no! Now there's two of those things!"
[OTH],"No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell."
[OTH],Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double.
[OTH],"I said, get out of my way! Aaaaggghhhh!!! Ogh. Noo--"
[OTH],Eeww.
[OTH],Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.
[OTH],Oohh... Bad pie... Bad pie...
[OTH],"This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!"
[OTH],Got 'em!
[OTH],He did it!
[OTH],"Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form?"
[OTH],Is this the kindergarten classroom?
[OTH],Jesse Jackson?
[OTH],That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!
[OTH],We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
[OTH],Oh. Bye.
[OTH],"Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--"
[OTH],"Mistoreh Garrison, I concede."
[OTH],"You... yuh, you what?"
[OTH],"I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this game is stupid."
[OTH],Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.
[OTH],"Ike, you could be class president."
[OTH],I pooped my pants!
[OTH],Can we fingerpaint now?
[OTH],Fingerpaint! Fingerpaint!
[OTH],Ohuh... Yes. Yes! Let's fingerpaint!
[OTH],"You did it, Kyle! Kyle saved your life, fat ass!"
[OTH],Look! I'm fading! It must have worked. I don't exist!
[OTH],"Huh, that's a bitch."
Cartman,"Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home."
[OTH],"Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!"
Cartman,"Awww, man..."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,"Alright, alright. Kyle..."
[OTH],"Dude, what's your little brother doing here?"
[OTH],Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
[OTH],But isn't he only three years old?
[OTH],"Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten."
[OTH],I pooped my pants.
[OTH],"But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper. It has five different compartments for each subject in school, and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek."
[OTH],Cool!
Cartman,"Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000. Yeah, well, it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's, flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar."
[OTH],"Wow, cool!"
[OTH],"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!"
Cartman,"Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase."
[OTH],He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
Cartman,He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
[OTH],I pooped my pants!
[OTH],"He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--"
Cartman,"Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume."
[OTH],"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"
[OTH],"Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus."
[OTH],Sit down and shut up!!
[OTH],But they smell like pee.
[OTH],I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.
[OTH],You are?
[OTH],Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.
[OTH],Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
[OTH],"I was held back ten human grades. I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?"
Cartman,"Yeah, that's me."
[OTH],Eric Cartman? And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?
Cartman,"Yeahhh, you already know about it?"
[OTH],"Yes. Yes, I do."
Cartman,"Well... ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"""
[OTH],I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
[OTH],"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?"
[OTH],"No, I don't! I don't care!"
Cartman,"Here, Kyle."
[OTH],"Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius."
[OTH],"Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten."
[OTH],"Come on. So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5?"
[OTH],Unkoo baba.
[OTH],"Okay, children, let's take our seats. My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little ""nervous breakdown"" and went into the mountains where I lived off of ""rat carcasses"". But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten. But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it? No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?"
[OTH],Here.
[OTH],Sally Bands?
[OTH],Here.
[OTH],Ike Broflovski?
[OTH],Cookie Monster.
[OTH],"Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too. Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve."
Cartman,And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically. I can take something as simple as this calculator and... Trapper Keeper?
[OTH],Trapper Keeper active.
Cartman,Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
[OTH],Ready for hybrid.
Cartman,"And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too."
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],May I hold your Trapper Keeper?
Cartman,"Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers. If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands."
[OTH],"Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!"
Cartman,"Oh really? Then, why don't you hold it? Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it. Hold it."
[OTH],I'm gonna!
Cartman,Hold it.
[OTH],I will!
[OTH],"And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better. Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president, so first we must pick nominees. Who would like to nominate someone?"
[OTH],"I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class."
[OTH],"Okay, Filmore. You'll be our first nominee. And who else? Yes, Jenny."
[OTH],I gotta go doodie.
[OTH],"In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president? Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius."
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius. Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?"
[OTH],"If I'm elected class president, I'll call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays, I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank you."
[OTH],"Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you?"
[OTH],Cookie Monster. Ice.
[OTH],"...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids."
[OTH],"Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid."
[OTH],"Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend? I mean, friend?"
Cartman,"I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once."
[OTH],"Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square-- I mean, four square."
Cartman,"Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me."
[OTH],"Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!"
Cartman,"Okay, that's cool."
[OTH],Can we play some human tetherball?
Cartman,"A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some--"
[OTH],Serve!
Cartman,Ugh..!
[OTH],Got it!
Cartman,Ey!
[OTH],Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper!
[OTH],Waa-agggh!
Cartman,"You son of a bitch! Wait a minute. Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device."
[OTH],What the hell just happened?
[OTH],Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
[OTH],"So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike. And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for. You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?"
[OTH],I don't know...
[OTH],"Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?"
[OTH],"Um, I vote for... I don't know."
[OTH],"Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer."
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"Flora, just say you vote for Filmore so we can all go home."
[OTH],Um...
[OTH],No! You want Ike to be president.
[OTH],We're gonna be here all night! Why don't you guys just concede?
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Why don't you just concede?
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Filmore!
[OTH],Ike!
[OTH],I want Ike to be president!
[OTH],"Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!"
Cartman,Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
[OTH],"Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder."
Cartman,"It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if-- There he is!"
[OTH],Wagh!
Cartman,Got ya!
[OTH],Hey!
[OTH],Gaagghhh!
[OTH],"Whoa, dude..!"
Cartman,"Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?"
[OTH],Please. You do not understand.
Cartman,"Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done."
[OTH],That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!
[OTH],"Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?"
[OTH],Bill Cosby?
[OTH],Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby. My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.
[OTH],"Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!"
[OTH],"I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world. It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind and there was nothing the humans could do. It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans. The nations tried everything to stop it. Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked. The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them. But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper. And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started."
[OTH],"Wow, that's amazing."
[OTH],"Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast."
[OTH],"What do you think, Officer Barbrady?"
[OTH],"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening."
[OTH],"And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper."
Cartman,You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
[OTH],"Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!"
Cartman,"What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!"
[OTH],Yes!
Cartman,"Aw, damnit! Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes!"
[OTH],I decided.
[OTH],"Oh, thank God, Flora! Alright, who do you vote for?"
[OTH],Umm... Ike.
[OTH],Yay!
[OTH],"Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president."
[OTH],We want a recount.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!
[OTH],"Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby! Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore... ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike."
[OTH],Count them again.
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!"
[OTH],"Wait, there's still that absent kid."
[OTH],"Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for his vote."
[OTH],"Oh, will you grow up?!"
[OTH],Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Absent kids count!
[OTH],"Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home!"
[OTH],"Good morning, humans."
[OTH],"Hey, Bill Cosby."
[OTH],"I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada."
[OTH],That should do it.
[OTH],"So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?"
[OTH],"Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right."
Cartman,"Hey, dudes."
[OTH],Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
Cartman,"Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one! So everything worked out."
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],"Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!"
Cartman,Why the hell not?!
[OTH],"Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!"
Cartman,Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
[OTH],We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
Cartman,But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
[OTH],"Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!"
Cartman,"Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,Ech! Screw you guys. Home.
[OTH],"Well, that does it!"
[OTH],Hey! What are you doing?
[OTH],"I'm afraid I have no other choice. For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him."
[OTH],Oh... Okay.
[OTH],"Yeah, that's fine. No, wait!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Can I do it?
[OTH],"Oh, well, I suppose."
[OTH],"Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!"
[OTH],"Wait! Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother."
[OTH],"Well, yeah, or we could just kill him."
[OTH],"Yeah, that'd be faster."
[OTH],He's right there.
[OTH],"I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call ""compassion"". It is an amazing feeling!"
[OTH],Awww..!
[OTH],"Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris? Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung. Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for... Filmore."
[OTH],Yay./Hooray.
[OTH],Wait one minute!
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ."
[OTH],I think the ballot were misleading. Some kids didn't understand whom they were voting for.
[OTH],There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?
[OTH],"You're just saying that, 'cause you know you're gonna lose now."
[OTH],"No, I'm saying that because you are a boogerface!"
[OTH],"Well, just you wait, 'cause my famous aunt is on huh way right now."
[OTH],Who's your famous aunt?
[OTH],"My aunt Rosie, Rosie O'Donnell."
[OTH],Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here?
[OTH],"Yeah, she's very active in politics. So she's gonna set all this straight."
[OTH],Oh no..!
[OTH],Recharging.
Cartman,"Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--"
[OTH],Trapper Keeper ready to ensorb.
Cartman,"Oh, cool."
[OTH],"Trapper Keeper, merging."
Cartman,Whoa...
[OTH],"And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper. Not now! Not ever!"
[OTH],"Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness."
[OTH],Correct.
[OTH],"Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill."
[OTH],Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?
[OTH],"In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first?"
[OTH],Uh-oh.
[OTH],Here we go again.
[OTH],"Come this way, Billy."
[OTH],"Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves."
Cartman,"Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--"
[OTH],"Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper!"
Cartman,"Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--"
[OTH],"Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb."
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"Dammit, Cartman, open up!"
[OTH],"Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid."
Cartman,"Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now? Ugh--!"
[OTH],"Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom."
[OTH],Cartman? He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
[OTH],You break it down!
[OTH],"Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!"
[OTH],"Not it! You lose, Kenny."
[OTH],(Awww..!) (Argh--!)
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You ba--!
[OTH],Agggghhh!
[OTH],"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!"
[OTH],"What the hell is that? Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom! Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door."
[OTH],"Hello, kids!"
[OTH],Aunt Rosie!
[OTH],"Run for your lives, children! I'll try to fight it off!"
[OTH],"That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell."
[OTH],"Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well."
[OTH],"Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem?"
[OTH],Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president.
[OTH],"No, Ike won."
[OTH],"Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--"
[OTH],"Well it obviously isn't that simple, is it? I mean, you'd think a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this, but now we're gonna do it my way!"
[OTH],We are Trapper Keeper.
[OTH],Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!
[OTH],Why is that bad?
[OTH],It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!
[OTH],Then we have to stop it before it gets there!
[OTH],"Step on it, Bill Cosby!"
[OTH],"Hey, Mark, look."
[OTH],Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen.
[OTH],"Cartman, you have to stop!"
[OTH],We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.
[OTH],A part of your friend must still be alive in there.
[OTH],He is in there.
[OTH],"That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU."
[OTH],"One-two-three, not it!"
[OTH],"Not-- Aw, damnit..!"
Cartman,"What are you doing, Kyle?"
[OTH],"I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU."
Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle."
[OTH],"Screw you, fat ass!"
Cartman,"Hey, screw you."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,Agh--!
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Okay, so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand, and after that, we're gonna go over the votes again manually, and then--"
[OTH],"Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it! Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year."
[OTH],We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated!
[OTH],"Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds! ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject there, kids."
[OTH],"How dare you! I will not be preached at by a country bumpkin! I'm leaving this Podunk town, but in my place I'm gonna send more lawyers, statesmen and press than you have ever seen!"
[OTH],"Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse."
[OTH],Aaghh!
[OTH],Wagghh!
[OTH],Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this. Car one to base-- Aghh!
[OTH],It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!
[OTH],Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
[OTH],I can't reach the CPU.
[OTH],What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!
[OTH],"Oh, no! Now there's two of those things!"
[OTH],"No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell."
[OTH],Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double.
[OTH],"I said, get out of my way! Aaaaggghhhh!!! Ogh. Noo--"
[OTH],Eeww.
[OTH],Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.
[OTH],Oohh... Bad pie... Bad pie...
[OTH],"This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!"
[OTH],Got 'em!
[OTH],He did it!
[OTH],"Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form?"
[OTH],Is this the kindergarten classroom?
[OTH],Jesse Jackson?
[OTH],That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!
[OTH],We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
[OTH],Oh. Bye.
[OTH],"Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--"
[OTH],"Mistoreh Garrison, I concede."
[OTH],"You... yuh, you what?"
[OTH],"I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this game is stupid."
[OTH],Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.
[OTH],"Ike, you could be class president."
[OTH],I pooped my pants!
[OTH],Can we fingerpaint now?
[OTH],Fingerpaint! Fingerpaint!
[OTH],Ohuh... Yes. Yes! Let's fingerpaint!
[OTH],"You did it, Kyle! Kyle saved your life, fat ass!"
[OTH],Look! I'm fading! It must have worked. I don't exist!
[OTH],"Huh, that's a bitch."
Cartman,"Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home."
[OTH],"Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!"
Cartman,"Awww, man..."
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,"Alright, alright. Kyle..."
[OTH],"Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?"
[OTH],"I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak."
[OTH],Oh no! NO!
[OTH],"'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do."
[OTH],My poor little Helen.
[OTH],Timmiihhh!
[OTH],"She can't see or hear us, John."
[OTH],"Heh-aaaah, Timmih!"
[OTH],E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
Cartman,"Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!"
[OTH],'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
[OTH],Can we take a lunch break now?
Cartman,"No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!"
[OTH],"Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate."
[OTH],Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
[OTH],"Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!"
[OTH],"Agh oh-ight, Timmih!"
Cartman,"God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!"
[OTH],Hey you guys! We got a big problem!
[OTH],"What is it, Butters?"
[OTH],"The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!"
Cartman,How good?
[OTH],"They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!"
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
[OTH],"Oh, now what?"
[OTH],"Oh yeah, we can't!"
Cartman,"Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!"
[OTH],Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
Cartman,"Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too."
[OTH],"Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?"
[OTH],"I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey."
[OTH],"Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks."
[OTH],Yeah
Cartman,"That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!"
[OTH],Okay!
Cartman,This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
[OTH],Yay!
[OTH],What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
[OTH],"A smart one, that can do tricks."
[OTH],"Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all. Go ahead, just pick one out."
[OTH],Timmaay!
[OTH],"Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter."
[OTH],Haaaaa!
[OTH],"Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!"
[OTH],TIMMAY!
[OTH],Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
[OTH],"What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!"
[OTH],T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!
[OTH],"Alright, we'll take him. How much?"
[OTH],Fifty bucks.
[OTH],But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
[OTH],I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
[OTH],"...God-damnit, here! Alright, Timmy, let's go!"
[OTH],"I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too."
[OTH],"Aw, blow it out your ass!"
Cartman,"Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks."
[OTH],Bravo.
[OTH],Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
[OTH],I would swear it on my life. Your play shall want for nothing.
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show."
Cartman,"Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey! What the hell is that?"
[OTH],It's a turkey. His name is Gobbles.
[OTH],GOBBLES!
Cartman,And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
[OTH],"Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one..."
[OTH],GOBBLES!
Cartman,"Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second? Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?"
[OTH],I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
Cartman,"You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"""
[OTH],"Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it."
[OTH],"He's not gonna work, Kyle. The whole point was to make our play better than the kindergartners."
[OTH],"Yeah, that turkey sucks."
[OTH],"Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? I know of a turkey."
[OTH],You do?
[OTH],During my years on Broadway I... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. She even jumped through a hoop of fire.
Cartman,Cool! Can you get it for us?
[OTH],I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey.
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Gobbles! Gobbles! Up, heh. Uh! Heeey, Gobbles! Gobbles. Gobbles!"
Cartman,No no!
[OTH],"Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed."
Cartman,"I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!"
[OTH],"Now, hon!"
Cartman,"But Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man."
[OTH],"Twenty more minutes, and that's it."
Cartman,"Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?! Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice. Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!"
[OTH],Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
Cartman,OP-pression!
[OTH],"Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time. Alabama, in the late 1800s"
[OTH],"1800's, Alabama! What a great place and time!We're so happy that we live in 1800's Alabama 'cause it's sunny and there is no crime!"
[OTH],Now to the refrain!
[OTH],"And in this little town in 1800's Alabama there's a family by the name of Keller! Their daughter's deaf and mute and blind as a bat, and her parents can't even tell her!!"
[OTH],"Excuse me, I am Lamond, the animal trainer."
[OTH],Oh. Cool! He's here!
Cartman,Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
[OTH],"Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's a very sensitive turkey! She performs feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the most beautiful bird in America! Four-time prize winner of the National Western Stock Show and reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com! I give you Alinicia!"
Cartman,Yeh.
[OTH],Wow.
Cartman,Whoa.
[OTH],Her feathers are beautiful.
[OTH],That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.
[OTH],Of course she is!
Cartman,"Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody! Where the hell is Timmy?"
[OTH],TIM-MIH!
[OTH],What... is... that?!
Cartman,"Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey."
[OTH],Gobbles! Gobbles?!
[OTH],"Timmy, we already got a turkey."
[OTH],"Yeah, and it's from Broadway."
[OTH],Gobbles.
Cartman,"No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!"
[OTH],"Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off."
Cartman,"No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part."
[OTH],Tim-mih.
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys!"
[OTH],My turkey does not work with other turkeys!
Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!"
[OTH],"Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright. Alright."
Cartman,"Dude, we need your turkey for our play!"
[OTH],She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!
Cartman,"I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?"
[OTH],Kill the other turkey!
Cartman,I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
[OTH],"Well, it could meet with ""an unfortunate accident."""
Cartman,"Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show? Oh."
[OTH],"It's very simple! Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical!"
Cartman,"Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything."
[OTH],"Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?"
[OTH],Dehh haaa.
[OTH],"Water, Helen, Water."
[OTH],She's never gonna do it. There's no way she'll ever do it.
[OTH],"Helen, Helen. Water, Helen."
[OTH],How can she talk if she can't hear? This is absolutely pointless!
Cartman,"Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second. Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2 stand just a little bit more over... here. Let's see, maybe a little more up in here. And just a wee bit over here. And right about... hm'ere. There we go. Good."
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],Whoa-aaaa
Cartman,"Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!"
[OTH],Let him rest in peace. Let him rest. Why must he die?
[OTH],They've got special effects!
[OTH],What Butters?
[OTH],"The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!"
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],We're never gonna outdo them now!
[OTH],But what are we gonna do?
Cartman,"Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work! All of us!"
[OTH],—and into your hands uh he... buh...
[OTH],"Gobbles! Hu-ugh, Gobbles!"
[OTH],Little boy.
[OTH],Timmy.
[OTH],"Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you. The others, well, they don't want you to know, but, oh, I don't know what to do. Should I tell you?"
[OTH],T-Timmih?
[OTH],I feel I'm the only one who can be honest with you. The animal shelter is on its way to...take your turkey away from you.
[OTH],Gobbles?
[OTH],"You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away."
[OTH],Gobbles!
[OTH],"They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and flayed while they're still alive. And no matter where you go, the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go. Back into the wild. Oh no! Here they come now! Quick, go! And set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them."
[OTH],T-tim-mih.
[OTH],"Eh, excuse me, we're here to install the water effects for the musical?"
[OTH],"Uh, the stage is right through there."
[OTH],Thanks.
Cartman,"Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see. no No. NO! God-damnit"
[OTH],"How is it going, Eric?"
Cartman,Terrible! I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
[OTH],"Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing."
Cartman,Like what?
[OTH],Let's see. Helen Keller was blind and deaf. Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here.
Cartman,"Hey, that's not a bad idea."
[OTH],Just relax. Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow...
Cartman,"Oh, man!"
[OTH],"Well, did you see anything?"
Cartman,"No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes."
[OTH],"...Oh, that's too bad."
Cartman,Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire! Yes! Yes! I have it now!
[OTH],The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go... let him go... let him go...
[OTH],"Gobbles! Gobbles!! Gobbles. Gobbles! Timmih. Timmih, Gobbles."
[OTH],"Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to heaven?"
[OTH],"She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice."
[OTH],But I miss her.
[OTH],"I could have so much more with my life, son. I've wasted it. I've wasted it, not ever telling you and Mark that I love you."
[OTH],"Robby! Robby, no!"
[OTH],"...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her! I have to move on."
[OTH],"Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry."
[OTH],Then why did you do it??
[OTH],I don't know!
[OTH],Have you done the right things in your life?
[OTH],"Hi, Sheila."
[OTH],"Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?"
[OTH],"Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance."
[OTH],"Oh, so did Gerald."
[OTH],"Oh yeah, I got a great angle here."
[OTH],"Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both."
[OTH],Good idea.
[OTH],So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
[OTH],"No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay."
[OTH],"You ready for the big show, Timmy?"
[OTH],"Where's Gobbles, Timmy?"
[OTH],Gobbles.
Cartman,"Alright everybody, let's take our places!"
[OTH],"Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?"
Cartman,"I don't know. I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole."
[OTH],"You're going to be brilliant, you sexy, gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling animal out of the way, you'll steal the show!"
[OTH],"Well, well, what are doing out here? You shouldn't be out walking the streets."
[OTH],"Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant."
[OTH],"Every year the fourth graders do ""The Miracle Worker,"" and every year I have to sit and watch it."
[OTH],"Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head. But luckily I got really stoned before I came."
[OTH],"And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, ""The Miracle Worker."""
[OTH],"Helen Keller, Helen Keller, blind as a bat.She can't hear us speak. What's up with that?"
[OTH],"This is ""The Miracle Worker""?"
[OTH],I... well... maybe.
[OTH],"Oh, oh, haha. Wow."
[OTH],Come on. Yaah! Move it!
[OTH],"Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey! It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas!"
[OTH],"John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch."
[OTH],"No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me."
[OTH],"She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!"
[OTH],Helen!
[OTH],...Helen! I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],Oh no! Oh no!!!
[OTH],She's brilliant! Everyone loves her so far.
Cartman,"Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights."
[OTH],"Look, we're only here to do the water effects. We're not in charge of electrical. That's a different union."
[OTH],Timmih?
Cartman,Union Mafia bastards!
[OTH],"Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love and theatre, right? Haha."
[OTH],Gobbles!!
[OTH],Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
[OTH],"He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave."
Cartman,Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
[OTH],"I do. I know the part. If I must, I can go on."
Cartman,"...Alright, fine! Get in costume!"
[OTH],Gobbles! Gobbles!
[OTH],"There it is! Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot! Here, turkey turkey."
[OTH],There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
[OTH],I cannot hear what they are saying. I cannot tell them how I feel I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
Cartman,What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
[OTH],If only I could say things that go on in my mind. I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
[OTH],"Oh, wow."
[OTH],That's it. Thaaat's it!
[OTH],Gobbles!
[OTH],Gotcha!
[OTH],Gobbles! T-timmih? Gobbles? Gobbles! Haaaah.
[OTH],"Aw, thank God you're alright, kid. It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?"
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Yes, that's it. That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!"
[OTH],Wawa.
[OTH],She did it!
[OTH],"She did it! She did it! Water! Water water aaaaaaaa!
Water, Helen, Water.
We can't believe she did it. The dumb kid really did it.
Water, Helen, Water."
[OTH],Now that I can communicate the world is not so cold and dark.
[OTH],"Water, Helen, Aaa-aaaaaa!"
[OTH],"Here it comes, angel! Your big finale! The audience is going to go wild! Oh. Back already? Don't worry. Maynard covered your part flawlessly."
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],Turkey shoot!
[OTH],"Alinicia! Jesus, no!"
[OTH],"Aaaa, Timmih!"
Cartman,"Okay, we're ready for the- What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!"
[OTH],"Hey, look!"
[OTH],"Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh!"
Cartman,They loved it! They LOVED it!
[OTH],Gobbles!
[OTH],"And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, ""Thanksgiving, Mon Ami."""
[OTH],"Okay, here we go."
[OTH],"Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be."
[OTH],"It's getting dinner. Let's all eat.
E I E I O.
And on that dinner we'll invite some Indians
E I E I O. With an Indian here and an Indian there
Everywhere an Indian, Indian. Uh thank, thank-"
[OTH],Aaaaaaa!
[OTH],Happy Thanksgiving.
[OTH],"Alright, see you next year, parents."
Cartman,That's it?
[OTH],We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
[OTH],Butters told us their play was awesome!
[OTH],"...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!"
[OTH],"Gobbles, Timmy!"
[OTH],"Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?"
[OTH],"I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak."
[OTH],Oh no! NO!
[OTH],"'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do."
[OTH],My poor little Helen.
[OTH],Timmiihhh!
[OTH],"She can't see or hear us, John."
[OTH],"Heh-aaaah, Timmih!"
[OTH],E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
Cartman,"Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!"
[OTH],'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
[OTH],Can we take a lunch break now?
Cartman,"No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!"
[OTH],"Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate."
[OTH],Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
[OTH],"Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!"
[OTH],"Agh oh-ight, Timmih!"
Cartman,"God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!"
[OTH],Hey you guys! We got a big problem!
[OTH],"What is it, Butters?"
[OTH],"The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!"
Cartman,How good?
[OTH],"They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!"
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
[OTH],"Oh, now what?"
[OTH],"Oh yeah, we can't!"
Cartman,"Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!"
[OTH],Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
Cartman,"Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too."
[OTH],"Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?"
[OTH],"I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey."
[OTH],"Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks."
[OTH],Yeah
Cartman,"That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!"
[OTH],Okay!
Cartman,This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
[OTH],Yay!
[OTH],What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
[OTH],"A smart one, that can do tricks."
[OTH],"Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all. Go ahead, just pick one out."
[OTH],Timmaay!
[OTH],"Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter."
[OTH],Haaaaa!
[OTH],"Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!"
[OTH],TIMMAY!
[OTH],Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
[OTH],"What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!"
[OTH],T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!
[OTH],"Alright, we'll take him. How much?"
[OTH],Fifty bucks.
[OTH],But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
[OTH],I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
[OTH],"...God-damnit, here! Alright, Timmy, let's go!"
[OTH],"I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too."
[OTH],"Aw, blow it out your ass!"
Cartman,"Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks."

[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],We're never gonna outdo them now!

[OTH],Thanks.
Cartman,"Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see. no No. NO! God-damnit"
[OTH],"How is it going, Eric?"
Cartman,Terrible! I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
[OTH],"Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing."
Cartman,Like what?
[OTH],Let's see. Helen Keller was blind and deaf. Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here.
Cartman,"Hey, that's not a bad idea."
[OTH],Just relax. Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow...
Cartman,"Oh, man!"
[OTH],"Well, did you see anything?"
Cartman,"No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes."
[OTH],"...Oh, that's too bad."
Cartman,Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire! Yes! Yes! I have it now!
[OTH],The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go... let him go... let him go...
[OTH],"Gobbles! Gobbles!! Gobbles. Gobbles! Timmih. Timmih, Gobbles."
[OTH],"Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to heaven?"
[OTH],"She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice."
[OTH],But I miss her.
[OTH],"I could have so much more with my life, son. I've wasted it. I've wasted it, not ever telling you and Mark that I love you."
[OTH],"Robby! Robby, no!"
[OTH],"...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her! I have to move on."
[OTH],"Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry."
[OTH],Then why did you do it??
[OTH],I don't know!
[OTH],Have you done the right things in your life?
[OTH],"Hi, Sheila."
[OTH],"Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?"
[OTH],"Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance."
[OTH],"Oh, so did Gerald."
[OTH],"Oh yeah, I got a great angle here."
[OTH],"Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both."
[OTH],Good idea.
[OTH],So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
[OTH],"No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay."
[OTH],"You ready for the big show, Timmy?"
[OTH],"Where's Gobbles, Timmy?"
[OTH],Gobbles.
Cartman,"Alright everybody, let's take our places!"
[OTH],"Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?"
Cartman,"I don't know. I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole."
[OTH],"You're going to be brilliant, you sexy, gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling animal out of the way, you'll steal the show!"
[OTH],"Well, well, what are doing out here? You shouldn't be out walking the streets."
[OTH],"Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant."
[OTH],"Every year the fourth graders do ""The Miracle Worker,"" and every year I have to sit and watch it."
[OTH],"Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head. But luckily I got really stoned before I came."
[OTH],"And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, ""The Miracle Worker."""
[OTH],"Helen Keller, Helen Keller, blind as a bat.She can't hear us speak. What's up with that?"
[OTH],"This is ""The Miracle Worker""?"
[OTH],I... well... maybe.
[OTH],"Oh, oh, haha. Wow."
[OTH],Come on. Yaah! Move it!
[OTH],"Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey! It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas!"
[OTH],"John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch."
[OTH],"No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me."
[OTH],"She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!"
[OTH],Helen!
[OTH],...Helen! I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],Oh no! Oh no!!!
[OTH],She's brilliant! Everyone loves her so far.
Cartman,"Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights."
[OTH],"Look, we're only here to do the water effects. We're not in charge of electrical. That's a different union."
[OTH],Timmih?
Cartman,Union Mafia bastards!
[OTH],"Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love and theatre, right? Haha."
[OTH],Gobbles!!
[OTH],Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
[OTH],"He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave."
Cartman,Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
[OTH],"I do. I know the part. If I must, I can go on."
Cartman,"...Alright, fine! Get in costume!"
[OTH],Gobbles! Gobbles!
[OTH],"There it is! Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot! Here, turkey turkey."
[OTH],There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
[OTH],I cannot hear what they are saying. I cannot tell them how I feel I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
Cartman,What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
[OTH],If only I could say things that go on in my mind. I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
[OTH],"Oh, wow."
[OTH],That's it. Thaaat's it!
[OTH],Gobbles!
[OTH],Gotcha!
[OTH],Gobbles! T-timmih? Gobbles? Gobbles! Haaaah.
[OTH],"Aw, thank God you're alright, kid. It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?"
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],"Yes, that's it. That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!"
[OTH],Wawa.
[OTH],She did it!
[OTH],"She did it! She did it! Water! Water water aaaaaaaa!
Water, Helen, Water.
We can't believe she did it. The dumb kid really did it.
Water, Helen, Water."
[OTH],Now that I can communicate the world is not so cold and dark.
[OTH],"Water, Helen, Aaa-aaaaaa!"
[OTH],"Here it comes, angel! Your big finale! The audience is going to go wild! Oh. Back already? Don't worry. Maynard covered your part flawlessly."
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],Turkey shoot!
[OTH],"Alinicia! Jesus, no!"
[OTH],"Aaaa, Timmih!"
Cartman,"Okay, we're ready for the- What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!"
[OTH],"Hey, look!"
[OTH],"Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh!"
Cartman,They loved it! They LOVED it!
[OTH],Gobbles!
[OTH],"And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, ""Thanksgiving, Mon Ami."""
[OTH],"Okay, here we go."
[OTH],"Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be."
[OTH],"It's getting dinner. Let's all eat.
E I E I O.
And on that dinner we'll invite some Indians
E I E I O. With an Indian here and an Indian there
Everywhere an Indian, Indian. Uh thank, thank-"
[OTH],Aaaaaaa!
[OTH],Happy Thanksgiving.
[OTH],"Alright, see you next year, parents."
Cartman,That's it?
[OTH],We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
[OTH],Butters told us their play was awesome!
[OTH],"...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!"
[OTH],"Gobbles, Timmy!"
[OTH],"Aaah. Dickens. The imagery of cobblestone streets, cragging London buildings, and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings. Hello, I'm a British person. For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park. However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from. He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, ""Great Expectations"" And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show, and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end. Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents."
[OTH],"'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again. Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together. But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon. Wa-a-ah!"
[OTH],"Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison? Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you."
[OTH],Wha' are you doin' wit' those?
[OTH],I'm an apprentice blacksmith. There you are. And here's a sandwich. You must be starving!
[OTH],Here. W-why are you easy to help me?
[OTH],"Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same. Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid."
[OTH],"Pip, where 'ave you been?!"
[OTH],"Waaah! Lovely day, isn't it?"
[OTH],"What the hell's lovely about it?! Joe, teach this boy some bloody cynicism!"
[OTH],"I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing. Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker."
[OTH],A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat!
[OTH],"Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange."
[OTH],"STOP your metal orange, you bastard! You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy! And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now!"
[OTH],"Oh, lookie heeah! I've gone and made a metal newspaper!"
[OTH],"Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper?"
[OTH],"Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!"
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],"""Havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to..."" TWENTY QUID A DAY??"
[OTH],That's a lot of money-loney.
[OTH],"You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town."
[OTH],"Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havisham's house to inquire about the job. and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams."
[OTH],Who are you?!
[OTH],...I've come to answer the want ad.
[OTH],"Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!"
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge! This way, you beef-witted shriveled-up monkey's penis. Up here, you gamy mass of baby vomit! In here."
[OTH],"Eho. After you, miss."
[OTH],"I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine!"
[OTH],Who is that?
[OTH],"I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am."
[OTH],Come closer. Look at me. Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?
[OTH],"Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days."
[OTH],"I sometimes have sick fancies. And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play."
[OTH],Um.
[OTH],"Estella, play with this boy."
[OTH],With HIM? But he's just a commoner!
[OTH],"But, you can break his heart."
[OTH],"...Alright, boy, let us play."
[OTH],Righty-o. What are we going to play?
[OTH],"We're going to play a little game called, ""Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."""
[OTH],"Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time! Who will go first?"
[OTH],"Oh, you stupid pathetic boy!"
[OTH],What do you think of her?
[OTH],"Well, uh... I think she's very pretty."
[OTH],Hm-m-m. What else?
[OTH],I think she's rather insulting.
[OTH],"Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall ""play"" some more."
[OTH],"That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind."
[OTH],"Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch!"
[OTH],"Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew."
[OTH],Don't you wanna play anymore?
[OTH],"Boy, do you still think I'm pretty?"
[OTH],"Oho. Well, yes, miss."
[OTH],"And, do you still think I'm insulting?"
[OTH],"Oh, um, not so much as before. Ow!"
[OTH],"I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!"
[OTH],"Oh, dear."
[OTH],You may kiss me if you like. Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden.
[OTH],"Oh, what fun it is to splash about in the fountain! You there, the prowling little boy! I bet you can't jump on my back! Go on, then. Try and jump on my back!"
[OTH],Who is that?
[OTH],"Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?"
[OTH],Oh I... rather thought I was.
[OTH],"Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden."
[OTH],"Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces."
[OTH],"Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day. Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely?? But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him, for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice."
[OTH],"And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it. Your very own metal fuzzy dice."
[OTH],"Yes. I see. Hoh, lovely."
[OTH],"Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?"
[OTH],"Joe, do you know anything about girls?"
[OTH],Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.
[OTH],"But, do you know anything about them? About how they work."
[OTH],"Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'."
[OTH],Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
[OTH],"Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip. Who could that be?"
[OTH],"Joe, the blacksmith?"
[OTH],The same.
[OTH],I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.
[OTH],"I'm Pip, sir."
[OTH],"Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice."
[OTH],"Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir."
[OTH],I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires. Do you still object?
[OTH],"Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-"
[OTH],He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.
[OTH],That's great news!
[OTH],"There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous."
[OTH],Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!
[OTH],"OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?"
[OTH],Yes sir.
[OTH],"Then you will go to London in a week's time. Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned."
[OTH],"I am, sir."
[OTH],"Then I should take my leave. Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip."
[OTH],"Good-bye, sir."
[OTH],Pip! A young gentleman! Of great expectations!
[OTH],"You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?"
[OTH],"None, sir."
[OTH],"I should think not. On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow."
[OTH],"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."
[OTH],Mr. Pip?
[OTH],Mr. Pocket?
[OTH],"Pray, come in!"
[OTH],Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
[OTH],"As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth. This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom."
[OTH],"My, how lovely."
[OTH],"Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them! I'm quite ashamed!"
[OTH],"Oh it's... quite alright. Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!"
[OTH],"Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!"
[OTH],"Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed."
[OTH],"That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!"
[OTH],"Well, what do you mean?"
[OTH],"Well, don't you know about Ms. Havisham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come! Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havisham."
[OTH],"Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?"
[OTH],"You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havisham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat. And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth."
[OTH],"Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry!"
[OTH],"Not at all, I'm sure. Anyway, Ms. Havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler."
[OTH],Sorry! Sorry!
[OTH],"Not at all, I'm sure. So this man pursued Ms. Havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom. And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!"
[OTH],Oh. Excuse me.
[OTH],"Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding."
[OTH],"At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house."
[OTH],"But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table."
[OTH],"Terribly sorry, Pocket."
[OTH],"Not at all, I'm sure!"
[OTH],"And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella."
[OTH],"Good evening, Ms. Havisham."
[OTH],"Come closer, Pip. My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?"
[OTH],Thanks to you.
[OTH],Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well. She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her?
[OTH],"Oh, my! She is even prettier than before."
[OTH],"Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?"
[OTH],"I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day."
[OTH],"Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it."
[OTH],Righto.
[OTH],"Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved."
[OTH],"Yes, but... where will I find her?"
[OTH],There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!
[OTH],"Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything! I'm the happiest boy in the land!"
[OTH],"And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper. Lover her."
[OTH],"Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world."
[OTH],"Hello, Estella."
[OTH],"Pip. My goodness, how you've changed!"
[OTH],Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I?
[OTH],I suppose. So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?
[OTH],"Well, I was sent to be schooled in London."
[OTH],"Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?"
[OTH],"Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all."
[OTH],Naturally.
[OTH],"It is wonderful to see you again, Estella."
[OTH],Is it? Why?
[OTH],Because I believe I'm in love with you.
[OTH],"Pip, you must know that I have no heart."
[OTH],I think you do.
[OTH],"Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment."
[OTH],"I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind."
[OTH],"Hey, Estella, let's get out of here."
[OTH],"Alright, Steve. Just one moment."
[OTH],Who...? Who is that?
[OTH],That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.
[OTH],"I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?"
[OTH],I should. He's my boyfriend.
[OTH],Boyfriend??
[OTH],"What's the matter, Pip?!"
[OTH],I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
[OTH],"It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip. He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very I'm leaving."
[OTH],Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a-
[OTH],"Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip."
[OTH],Ms. Havisham! But um...
[OTH],"Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip? Look at the way he holds her hand."
[OTH],But I don't understand. You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
[OTH],"Things aren't always as they seem, Pip. Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?"
[OTH],"...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt."
[OTH],Yes. Tell me about the pain. Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.
[OTH],It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss squeezing it very tightly.
[OTH],"Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe."
[OTH],"Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?"
[OTH],Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.
[OTH],But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
[OTH],"Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device. You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation."
[OTH],What the hell??
[OTH],"Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform."
[OTH],"Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me! What the?!"
[OTH],"And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you!"
[OTH],"Pip? Pip, old chap?"
[OTH],Joe?
[OTH],That's right. You're safe and warm now.
[OTH],"Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours."
[OTH],"Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house! Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?"
[OTH],"Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you."
[OTH],"Allo, Pip. You remember me?"
[OTH],I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse!
[OTH],"Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago."
[OTH],"Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire."
[OTH],"'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!"
[OTH],You? But why?
[OTH],Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.
[OTH],"Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it."
[OTH],"I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex."
[OTH],"Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone."
[OTH],Righto. Pip. Righto.
[OTH],And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
[OTH],"What's that, Pip."
[OTH],"If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!"
[OTH],"Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?"
[OTH],"Yes, Mother."
[OTH],"Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch."
[OTH],Pip?
[OTH],"Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!"
[OTH],"Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin."
[OTH],"Dear God, Pip, look!"
[OTH],"Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!"
[OTH],So am I.
[OTH],And me.
[OTH],We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed.
[OTH],"Yes. Cry away, males. Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete."
[OTH],You won't get away with this!
[OTH],Won't I? Let the transformation begin.
[OTH],"Pip, she started the device!"
[OTH],"Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!"
[OTH],"Righto, Pip."
[OTH],It begins.
[OTH],"Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this."
[OTH],It is... what I was raised for.
[OTH],AAAAAAA!!!
[OTH],"Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid."
[OTH],"How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!"
[OTH],"Yes, but just think about... panda bears! Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are. What silly little noses they have!"
[OTH],Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.
[OTH],"Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive."
[OTH],...Yes...
[OTH],"Get out of that chair, you old cow!"
[OTH],"Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart."
[OTH],"I told you, Pip. I have no heart."
[OTH],But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all! Look at this adorable little bunny.
[OTH],Oh my. 'E's very cute.
[OTH],You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck. ...Oh. But look at this bunny. There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies. ...Right.
[OTH],"Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors."
[OTH],My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.
[OTH],"Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about..."
[OTH],Ice-skating!
[OTH],Oh what fun ice-skating is! Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.
[OTH],Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!
[OTH],Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to- Ten baby bunnies!
[OTH],...There's too many of them!
[OTH],"Please, sirs, you must not cry!"
[OTH],We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears!
[OTH],"Philip, it's too late!!"
[OTH],Twenty-six baby bunnies
[OTH],I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I don't want to kill any more of them.
[OTH],There! You see?! You do have a heart!
[OTH],You think so? Let me see it Maybe I can kill it.
[OTH],"No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now!"
[OTH],Yessss! Noooo!
[OTH],"Ooooo, top smart, Pip!"
[OTH],"You did it, Pip!"
[OTH],"Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?"
[OTH],Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.
[OTH],"You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!"
[OTH],"Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love!"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked out. Where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then, Pip?"
[OTH],"And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B. So ends Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. We hope you now have a deeper appreciation for Pip, and indeed, all masterpieces of literature like this one. Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night."
[OTH],"Aaah. Dickens. The imagery of cobblestone streets, cragging London buildings, and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings. Hello, I'm a British person. For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park. However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from. He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, ""Great Expectations"" And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show, and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end. Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents."
[OTH],"'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again. Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together. But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon. Wa-a-ah!"
[OTH],"Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison? Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you."
[OTH],Wha' are you doin' wit' those?
[OTH],I'm an apprentice blacksmith. There you are. And here's a sandwich. You must be starving!
[OTH],Here. W-why are you easy to help me?
[OTH],"Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same. Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid."
[OTH],"Pip, where 'ave you been?!"
[OTH],"Waaah! Lovely day, isn't it?"
[OTH],"What the hell's lovely about it?! Joe, teach this boy some bloody cynicism!"
[OTH],"I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing. Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker."
[OTH],A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat!
[OTH],"Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange."
[OTH],"STOP your metal orange, you bastard! You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy! And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now!"
[OTH],"Oh, lookie heeah! I've gone and made a metal newspaper!"
[OTH],"Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper?"
[OTH],"Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!"
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],Where?
[OTH],"""Havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to..."" TWENTY QUID A DAY??"
[OTH],That's a lot of money-loney.
[OTH],"You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town."
[OTH],"Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havisham's house to inquire about the job. and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams."
[OTH],Who are you?!
[OTH],...I've come to answer the want ad.
[OTH],"Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!"
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge! This way, you beef-witted shriveled-up monkey's penis. Up here, you gamy mass of baby vomit! In here."
[OTH],"Eho. After you, miss."
[OTH],"I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine!"
[OTH],Who is that?
[OTH],"I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am."
[OTH],Come closer. Look at me. Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?
[OTH],"Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days."
[OTH],"I sometimes have sick fancies. And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play."
[OTH],Um.
[OTH],"Estella, play with this boy."
[OTH],With HIM? But he's just a commoner!
[OTH],"But, you can break his heart."
[OTH],"...Alright, boy, let us play."
[OTH],Righty-o. What are we going to play?
[OTH],"We're going to play a little game called, ""Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."""
[OTH],"Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time! Who will go first?"
[OTH],"Oh, you stupid pathetic boy!"
[OTH],What do you think of her?
[OTH],"Well, uh... I think she's very pretty."
[OTH],Hm-m-m. What else?
[OTH],I think she's rather insulting.
[OTH],"Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall ""play"" some more."
[OTH],"That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind."
[OTH],"Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch!"
[OTH],"Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew."
[OTH],Don't you wanna play anymore?
[OTH],"Boy, do you still think I'm pretty?"
[OTH],"Oho. Well, yes, miss."
[OTH],"And, do you still think I'm insulting?"
[OTH],"Oh, um, not so much as before. Ow!"
[OTH],"I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!"
[OTH],"Oh, dear."
[OTH],You may kiss me if you like. Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden.
[OTH],"Oh, what fun it is to splash about in the fountain! You there, the prowling little boy! I bet you can't jump on my back! Go on, then. Try and jump on my back!"
[OTH],Who is that?
[OTH],"Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?"
[OTH],Oh I... rather thought I was.
[OTH],"Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden."
[OTH],"Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces."
[OTH],"Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day. Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely?? But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him, for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice."
[OTH],"And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it. Your very own metal fuzzy dice."
[OTH],"Yes. I see. Hoh, lovely."
[OTH],"Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?"
[OTH],"Joe, do you know anything about girls?"
[OTH],Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.
[OTH],"But, do you know anything about them? About how they work."
[OTH],"Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'."
[OTH],Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
[OTH],"Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip. Who could that be?"
[OTH],"Joe, the blacksmith?"
[OTH],The same.
[OTH],I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.
[OTH],"I'm Pip, sir."
[OTH],"Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice."
[OTH],"Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir."
[OTH],I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires. Do you still object?
[OTH],"Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-"
[OTH],He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.
[OTH],That's great news!
[OTH],"There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous."
[OTH],Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!
[OTH],"OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?"
[OTH],Yes sir.
[OTH],"Then you will go to London in a week's time. Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned."
[OTH],"I am, sir."
[OTH],"Then I should take my leave. Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip."
[OTH],"Good-bye, sir."
[OTH],Pip! A young gentleman! Of great expectations!
[OTH],"You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?"
[OTH],"None, sir."
[OTH],"I should think not. On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow."
[OTH],"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."
[OTH],Mr. Pip?
[OTH],Mr. Pocket?
[OTH],"Pray, come in!"
[OTH],Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
[OTH],"As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth. This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom."
[OTH],"My, how lovely."
[OTH],"Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them! I'm quite ashamed!"
[OTH],"Oh it's... quite alright. Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!"
[OTH],"Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!"
[OTH],"Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed."
[OTH],"That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!"
[OTH],"Well, what do you mean?"
[OTH],"Well, don't you know about Ms. Havisham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come! Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havisham."
[OTH],"Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?"
[OTH],"You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havisham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat. And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth."
[OTH],"Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry!"
[OTH],"Not at all, I'm sure. Anyway, Ms. Havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler."
[OTH],Sorry! Sorry!
[OTH],"Not at all, I'm sure. So this man pursued Ms. Havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom. And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!"
[OTH],Oh. Excuse me.
[OTH],"Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding."
[OTH],"At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house."
[OTH],"But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table."
[OTH],"Terribly sorry, Pocket."
[OTH],"Not at all, I'm sure!"
[OTH],"And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella."
[OTH],"Good evening, Ms. Havisham."
[OTH],"Come closer, Pip. My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?"
[OTH],Thanks to you.
[OTH],Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well. She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her?
[OTH],"Oh, my! She is even prettier than before."
[OTH],"Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?"
[OTH],"I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day."
[OTH],"Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it."
[OTH],Righto.
[OTH],"Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved."
[OTH],"Yes, but... where will I find her?"
[OTH],There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!
[OTH],"Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything! I'm the happiest boy in the land!"
[OTH],"And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper. Lover her."
[OTH],"Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world."
[OTH],"Hello, Estella."
[OTH],"Pip. My goodness, how you've changed!"
[OTH],Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I?
[OTH],I suppose. So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?
[OTH],"Well, I was sent to be schooled in London."
[OTH],"Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?"
[OTH],"Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all."
[OTH],Naturally.
[OTH],"It is wonderful to see you again, Estella."
[OTH],Is it? Why?
[OTH],Because I believe I'm in love with you.
[OTH],"Pip, you must know that I have no heart."
[OTH],I think you do.
[OTH],"Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment."
[OTH],"I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind."
[OTH],"Hey, Estella, let's get out of here."
[OTH],"Alright, Steve. Just one moment."
[OTH],Who...? Who is that?
[OTH],That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.
[OTH],"I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?"
[OTH],I should. He's my boyfriend.
[OTH],Boyfriend??
[OTH],"What's the matter, Pip?!"
[OTH],I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
[OTH],"It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip. He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very I'm leaving."
[OTH],Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a-
[OTH],"Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip."
[OTH],Ms. Havisham! But um...
[OTH],"Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip? Look at the way he holds her hand."
[OTH],But I don't understand. You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
[OTH],"Things aren't always as they seem, Pip. Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?"
[OTH],"...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt."
[OTH],Yes. Tell me about the pain. Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.
[OTH],It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss squeezing it very tightly.
[OTH],"Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe."
[OTH],"Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?"
[OTH],Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.
[OTH],But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
[OTH],"Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device. You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation."
[OTH],What the hell??
[OTH],"Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform."
[OTH],"Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me! What the?!"
[OTH],"And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you!"
[OTH],"Pip? Pip, old chap?"
[OTH],Joe?
[OTH],That's right. You're safe and warm now.
[OTH],"Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours."
[OTH],"Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house! Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?"
[OTH],"Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you."
[OTH],"Allo, Pip. You remember me?"
[OTH],I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse!
[OTH],"Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago."
[OTH],"Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire."
[OTH],"'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!"
[OTH],You? But why?
[OTH],Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.
[OTH],"Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it."
[OTH],"I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex."
[OTH],"Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone."
[OTH],Righto. Pip. Righto.
[OTH],And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
[OTH],"What's that, Pip."
[OTH],"If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!"
[OTH],"Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?"
[OTH],"Yes, Mother."
[OTH],"Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch."
[OTH],Pip?
[OTH],"Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!"
[OTH],"Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin."
[OTH],"Dear God, Pip, look!"
[OTH],"Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!"
[OTH],So am I.
[OTH],And me.
[OTH],We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed.
[OTH],"Yes. Cry away, males. Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete."
[OTH],You won't get away with this!
[OTH],Won't I? Let the transformation begin.
[OTH],"Pip, she started the device!"
[OTH],"Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!"
[OTH],"Righto, Pip."
[OTH],It begins.
[OTH],"Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this."
[OTH],It is... what I was raised for.
[OTH],AAAAAAA!!!
[OTH],"Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid."
[OTH],"How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!"
[OTH],"Yes, but just think about... panda bears! Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are. What silly little noses they have!"
[OTH],Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.
[OTH],"Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive."
[OTH],...Yes...
[OTH],"Get out of that chair, you old cow!"
[OTH],"Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart."
[OTH],"I told you, Pip. I have no heart."
[OTH],But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all! Look at this adorable little bunny.
[OTH],Oh my. 'E's very cute.
[OTH],You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck. ...Oh. But look at this bunny. There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies. ...Right.
[OTH],"Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors."
[OTH],My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.
[OTH],"Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about..."
[OTH],Ice-skating!
[OTH],Oh what fun ice-skating is! Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.
[OTH],Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!
[OTH],Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to- Ten baby bunnies!
[OTH],...There's too many of them!
[OTH],"Please, sirs, you must not cry!"
[OTH],We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears!
[OTH],"Philip, it's too late!!"
[OTH],Twenty-six baby bunnies
[OTH],I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I don't want to kill any more of them.
[OTH],There! You see?! You do have a heart!
[OTH],You think so? Let me see it Maybe I can kill it.
[OTH],"No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now!"
[OTH],Yessss! Noooo!
[OTH],"Ooooo, top smart, Pip!"
[OTH],"You did it, Pip!"
[OTH],"Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?"
[OTH],Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.
[OTH],"You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!"
[OTH],"Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love!"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked out. Where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then, Pip?"
[OTH],"And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B. So ends Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. We hope you now have a deeper appreciation for Pip, and indeed, all masterpieces of literature like this one. Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night."
[OTH],"Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Woohoo.
[OTH],"Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee. Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea."
[OTH],"Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?"
[OTH],"They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them. Now, we don't have quite enough manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four."
[OTH],Hey! Ours is still alive!
[OTH],"Oh, hold on. Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen."
[OTH],"I can't do it, dude."
[OTH],"Aw, don't be such a baby! You do it, Kenny."
[OTH],(Nuh uh!)
[OTH],"Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!"
[OTH],(FIVE BUCKS???)
[OTH],Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
[OTH],"Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso."
[OTH],I don't see anything.
[OTH],Look closer. Closer. Hunh-nh.
[OTH],"I still don't see anything, Phillip."
[OTH],Waitwait. Hunh.
Cartman,"I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?"
[OTH],"Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here. Ah! Af!"
[OTH],AAHahahahahahaaa!
Cartman,Whoa! That totally surprised me! I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
[OTH],"Eh yes, sweetie."
Cartman,"Mom, can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball?"
[OTH],"Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself? Mommy's expecting some company."
Cartman,"God, I have to do everything around here!"
Cartman,"I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- What the hell's going on?"
[OTH],"Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a ""talk"" with you."
[OTH],"Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?"
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],We believe that you might have a problem.
Cartman,You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
[OTH],"It's called intervention, Eric."
[OTH],Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
Cartman,Fat camp?
[OTH],"Yes, fat camp."
Cartman,"Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this, but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!"
[OTH],"Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you."
[OTH],"Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you."
Cartman,"Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!"
[OTH],"Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat."
[OTH],And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-
[OTH],"Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?"
[OTH],"Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back."
[OTH],"Aw, dude, check this out."
[OTH],That's so gross.
[OTH],"Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?"
[OTH],(I'm not eatin' that!)
[OTH],I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
[OTH],I'll throw in five.
[OTH],And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.
[OTH],Oh dear.
[OTH],I'll throw in a dollar!
[OTH],I've got three.
[OTH],"Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!"
[OTH],Forty-one bucks. Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!
[OTH],"Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together."
[OTH],"...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want. Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin."
[OTH],Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman.
[OTH],Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.
[OTH],"Oh, we'll change that. Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?"
Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off, Rick! How are you?"
[OTH],"I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get you oriented. I'll take care of him from here, ma'am."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, goodbye, sweetie."
Cartman,Don't touch me!
[OTH],"Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!"
[OTH],Have you got any candy?
Cartman,No.
[OTH],My mom says I ain't to eat no candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight.
[OTH],"Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is fun, right gang?"
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],Wait a second. Do you kids hear something? I could've swore that-
[OTH],Raaarrrr!!!
[OTH],"Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!"
[OTH],I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow!
[OTH],Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise! And... Proper Diet.
[OTH],Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me.
[OTH],"I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan, who's another weight counselor!"
[OTH],Heh! It was a lady in a costume!
Cartman,Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
[OTH],What's the matter?
[OTH],Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick.
[OTH],Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it.
[OTH],Eewww.
[OTH],"Well, at least you got it out of your system."
[OTH],"Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen! How much, Kenny?"
[OTH],(WHAT?!)
[OTH],I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
[OTH],Huh-I'm in for five!
[OTH],"Oh, you guys!"
[OTH],I've got three.
[OTH],Six!
[OTH],Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos.
[OTH],"That's 19 bucks, Kenny!"
[OTH],(Ungh.)
[OTH],AAAAA!
[OTH],Waugh.
[OTH],"Kick ass, dude!"
[OTH],"You know, dude, there might be something to this."
[OTH],Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
[OTH],Doing great kids! Come on!
Cartman,This... is... bullcrap!
[OTH],"Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?"
Cartman,I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
[OTH],I hope you all left room for dessert. Soybean pudding for everybody!
[OTH],Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?
Cartman,Take it! I can't eat this crap!
[OTH],Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die.
Cartman,"Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass."
[OTH],I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?
Cartman,"Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!"
Cartman,"Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run? An ice cream truck! Hey wait! Boy, am I glad to see you!"
[OTH],Can I interest you in some ice cream?
Cartman,"You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!"
[OTH],"Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind?"
Cartman,Hunh? Uuh!
[OTH],"They tricked us again, huh?"
Cartman,"Aw, God-damnit! LET ME OUT OF HMYA!"
[OTH],"Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time."
[OTH],"They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us."
[OTH],Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy.
[OTH],Hey kids!
[OTH],Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.
[OTH],"Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave."
[OTH],There is no escape.
[OTH],"So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT!"
Cartman,"Aw, damnit!"
[OTH],That's what being young is all about.
[OTH],But that's not the question.
[OTH],"Thanks for coming, everybody."
[OTH],"Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at his weight-management camp?"
[OTH],We knew he wouldn't make it.
[OTH],"Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman."
Cartman,"Hey, dudes!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],I don't believe it.
[OTH],Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp.
[OTH],"Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Congratulations. How do you feel?
Cartman,I feel awesome!
[OTH],What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
Cartman,"You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy! Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle."
[OTH],I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
Cartman,Memememeee!
[OTH],Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
[OTH],Did you like the old one?
[OTH],Good point.
[OTH],"And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South Park Public Access."
[OTH],"Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength."
Cartman,"No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works."
[OTH],"A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman! Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny?"
Cartman,"God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!"
[OTH],"Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny."
[OTH],(Sure!)
[OTH],Do it again!
[OTH],Do it again!
[OTH],Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!
Cartman,This is ridiculous!
[OTH],"So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?"
[OTH],"We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing."
[OTH],"I can't say I approve of this, my children."
[OTH],Huh? Why not?
[OTH],Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
[OTH],I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit.
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Yeah! Go for it!
[OTH],What's a prostitute?
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
[OTH],"Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! ""Chef, what's the clitoris?"" ""What's a lesbian, Chef?"" ""How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?"" For once, can't you just come in here and say, ""Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?""!"
[OTH],"Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"
[OTH],It sure is! Thank you.
[OTH],"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
[OTH],Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
Cartman,Lunchtime! I'm starved!
[OTH],Oh my God. Eric?
Cartman,That's me.
[OTH],Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
[OTH],Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
[OTH],Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
[OTH],(Yeah. Am I?)
[OTH],"Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services."
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],Like keeping you company. Understand?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children. That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards. That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor."
[OTH],"A prostitute is like any other woman
They all trade somethin' for sex and they do it well."
[OTH],And that's why I say-
[OTH],Prostitutes! Prostitutes! They-
[OTH],"Oohhhh ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here! ...These children tricked me!"
Cartman,"Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy."
Cartman,Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
Cartman,Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
Cartman,"Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!"
Cartman,Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
Cartman,What?!
Cartman,"I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!"
Cartman,Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
Cartman,Twenty.
Cartman,"Suck my balls, 20!"
Cartman,Fine! Then I shall bid you good day!
Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed!"
[OTH],You guys! You have to check this tape out!
[OTH],"Ey, we're trying to study. Finals are tomorrow."
[OTH],"No, dude, check this out! It's a video: this kid, he does all kinds of crazy stuff. Check it out! He jumped into a Porto-Potty at a construction site and stayed there for four days!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],(Ow.)
[OTH],"Oh, gro-hoss"
[OTH],Sick!
[OTH],That's awesome! Hey guys! Check this out!
[OTH],"Get ready for the Krrrrrrazy Kenny Show! And now here's your host, the kid who will do anything to himself for money, Krrrra—a--a-a-azy Kenny! Kenny, through the past weeks we've seen you eat mice, pretend to kill newborn babies to shock their mothers and ...wash your hair with battery acid. The question in all our minds is, who-haht are you gonna do next?"
[OTH],"(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)"
[OTH],"Whoa-ho ho! You heard him, folks! Kenny is going to give a sensual full-body massage to his own grandfather!"
[OTH],Oho! Yeah!
[OTH],Woohoo!
[OTH],Awww! Awgh!
[OTH],Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
Cartman,This is so juvenile.
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you?"
[OTH],"Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?"
Cartman,"Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home?"
[OTH],"Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet."
[OTH],"All beddy-byes for the night, are they?"
[OTH],"I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight."
[OTH],We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it!
[OTH],They'll do it.
[OTH],They'll do it!!
Cartman,"Alright, they're gone! The Cartman store is open!"
[OTH],"Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please."
Cartman,"Two donuts and a pack of licorice. Well, Tony, the usual? Why are you crying, Chad?"
[OTH],"'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this. All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself."
Cartman,"Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend."
[OTH],"I'd, I do?"
Cartman,"Yes. A chocolate friend. Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are. Look at how yummy and sweet he is. ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars. ...There you go."
[OTH],"This week on Pay Per View , Krazy Kenny will crawl up into a woman's uterus and stay there for six hours. Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime event. Order now!"
[OTH],"Alright, so we're back talkin' to three competing celebrities: Tom Green, Johnny Knoxville from MTV's Jackass and Krazy Kenny."
[OTH],"Hey, Howard."
[OTH],"Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View special this week, where he will crawl up into a bus driver's uterus and stay there for six hours."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now."
[OTH],I'm in.
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],(And me!)
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Fine! I'll do it for 40!
[OTH],30.
[OTH],20!
[OTH],(...Ten bucks!)
[OTH],"Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks."
[OTH],Damnit. I'm out.
[OTH],Me too. I guess he is the biggest whore.
[OTH],"Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras?"
[OTH],And we're gonna reach for the sky...
[OTH],Woo-aagh.
[OTH],And down to the ground.
[OTH],Woo-ugh.
[OTH],And up to the sky...
[OTH],Woo-aagh.
[OTH],And down to the ground.
[OTH],Woo-ugh.
[OTH],"Please, Mr. Sanders."
[OTH],No! I have had it!
[OTH],What's happening?
[OTH],Horace's parents want to take him home.
[OTH],Oh! But he's not ready yet.
[OTH],"Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics!"
[OTH],They can lose the weight if they try.
[OTH],Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner! Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that most fat people are just genetically fat!
[OTH],"Please, sir, if you give us one more week,..."
[OTH],Your time is up!
[OTH],"Yeah, your time is up!"
[OTH],And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim their kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time!
[OTH],"But, Dad, I..."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],...Nothin'.
[OTH],"We're in trouble, Rick."
[OTH],"Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?"
[OTH],HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
[OTH],Six hours.
[OTH],"HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!"
[OTH],Great.
[OTH],You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
[OTH],For what?
[OTH],For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
[OTH],Who-what's a hummer??
[OTH],I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
[OTH],Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
[OTH],I know!
[OTH],"He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus."
Cartman,"You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame."
[OTH],"...Alright, that does it! This has been bothering the hell out of me! I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!"
Cartman,Uh oh.
[OTH],"Well, we've seen him do just about every disgusting thing in the book, and today live on pay-per-view, Krazy Kenny is going to crawl into a woman's uterus for six hours! Well, Ms. Crabtree, your cervix has been dilated, your womb equipped with oxygen- How do you feel?"
[OTH],I feel great! I haven't had this much attention paid to my coot since I was 16!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the-"
[OTH],"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great."
[OTH],No way! I'm not doing this!
[OTH],"Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!"
[OTH],But this isn't fair!
[OTH],"Deal, druggie!"
[OTH],(But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there!)
[OTH],"And here he is, Kenny McCormick! We can watch him on the video monitors. How are you doin' in there, Kenny?"
[OTH],That's my boy!
[OTH],"Good-bye, Chad."
[OTH],"We'll be wanting our refund, naturally."
[OTH],Naturally.
[OTH],"Good-bye, Alice."
[OTH],Good-bye. Thank you.
[OTH],"Oh, don't thank us. We failed you."
Cartman,"...65, 66, 67..."
[OTH],"Wait a second! This isn't right! It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food!"
Cartman,"Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!"
[OTH],"No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat."
[OTH],"Well, it's alright with me. Parents?"
[OTH],"Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all done you can teach me a thing or two, huh son?"
Cartman,"You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight!"
[OTH],"Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],Bubbye.
Cartman,"Well, screw you, fatasses!"
[OTH],"Four, three, two, one!"
[OTH],"He did it! Come on out, Kenny! You made it six hours, Kenny. Come on out of there. Hmmm. Uh, Ms. Crabtree, maybe you could give him a little push."
[OTH],OOOOHHHHHH!
[OTH],He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.
[OTH],I told you I was a tight virgin flower.
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of."
[OTH],Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
[OTH],"Well, he gave his life for our amusement. One little boy who dared to be different. Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick. Who was that?"
[OTH],"Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Woohoo.
[OTH],"Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee. Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea."
[OTH],"Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?"
[OTH],"They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them. Now, we don't have quite enough manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four."
[OTH],Hey! Ours is still alive!
[OTH],"Oh, hold on. Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen."
[OTH],"I can't do it, dude."
[OTH],"Aw, don't be such a baby! You do it, Kenny."
[OTH],(Nuh uh!)
[OTH],"Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!"
[OTH],(FIVE BUCKS???)
[OTH],Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
[OTH],"Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso."
[OTH],I don't see anything.
[OTH],Look closer. Closer. Hunh-nh.
[OTH],"I still don't see anything, Phillip."
[OTH],Waitwait. Hunh.
Cartman,"I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?"
[OTH],"Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here. Ah! Af!"
[OTH],AAHahahahahahaaa!
Cartman,Whoa! That totally surprised me! I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
[OTH],"Eh yes, sweetie."
Cartman,"Mom, can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball?"
[OTH],"Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself? Mommy's expecting some company."
Cartman,"God, I have to do everything around here!"
Cartman,"I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- What the hell's going on?"
[OTH],"Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a ""talk"" with you."
[OTH],"Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?"
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],We believe that you might have a problem.
Cartman,You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
[OTH],"It's called intervention, Eric."
[OTH],Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
Cartman,Fat camp?
[OTH],"Yes, fat camp."
Cartman,"Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this, but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!"
[OTH],"Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you."
[OTH],"Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you."
Cartman,"Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!"
[OTH],"Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat."
[OTH],And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-
[OTH],"Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?"
[OTH],"Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back."
[OTH],"Aw, dude, check this out."
[OTH],That's so gross.
[OTH],"Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?"
[OTH],(I'm not eatin' that!)
[OTH],I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
[OTH],I'll throw in five.
[OTH],And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.
[OTH],Oh dear.
[OTH],I'll throw in a dollar!
[OTH],I've got three.
[OTH],"Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!"
[OTH],Forty-one bucks. Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!
[OTH],"Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together."
[OTH],"...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want. Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin."
[OTH],Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman.
[OTH],Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.
[OTH],"Oh, we'll change that. Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?"
Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off, Rick! How are you?"
[OTH],"I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get you oriented. I'll take care of him from here, ma'am."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, goodbye, sweetie."
Cartman,Don't touch me!
[OTH],"Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!"
[OTH],Have you got any candy?
Cartman,No.
[OTH],My mom says I ain't to eat no candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight.
[OTH],"Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is fun, right gang?"
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],Wait a second. Do you kids hear something? I could've swore that-
[OTH],Raaarrrr!!!
[OTH],"Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!"
[OTH],I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow!
[OTH],Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise! And... Proper Diet.
[OTH],Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me.
[OTH],"I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan, who's another weight counselor!"
[OTH],Heh! It was a lady in a costume!
Cartman,Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
[OTH],What's the matter?
[OTH],Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick.
[OTH],Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it.
[OTH],Eewww.
[OTH],"Well, at least you got it out of your system."
[OTH],"Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen! How much, Kenny?"
[OTH],(WHAT?!)
[OTH],I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
[OTH],Huh-I'm in for five!
[OTH],"Oh, you guys!"
[OTH],I've got three.
[OTH],Six!
[OTH],Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos.
[OTH],"That's 19 bucks, Kenny!"
[OTH],(Ungh.)
[OTH],AAAAA!
[OTH],Waugh.
[OTH],"Kick ass, dude!"
[OTH],"You know, dude, there might be something to this."
[OTH],Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
[OTH],Doing great kids! Come on!
Cartman,This... is... bullcrap!
[OTH],"Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?"
Cartman,I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
[OTH],I hope you all left room for dessert. Soybean pudding for everybody!
[OTH],Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?
Cartman,Take it! I can't eat this crap!
[OTH],Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die.
Cartman,"Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass."
[OTH],I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?
Cartman,"Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!"
Cartman,"Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run? An ice cream truck! Hey wait! Boy, am I glad to see you!"
[OTH],Can I interest you in some ice cream?
Cartman,"You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!"
[OTH],"Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind?"
Cartman,Hunh? Uuh!
[OTH],"They tricked us again, huh?"
Cartman,"Aw, God-damnit! LET ME OUT OF HMYA!"
[OTH],"Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time."
[OTH],"They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us."
[OTH],Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy.
[OTH],Hey kids!
[OTH],Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.
[OTH],"Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave."
[OTH],There is no escape.
[OTH],"So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT!"
Cartman,"Aw, damnit!"
[OTH],That's what being young is all about.
[OTH],But that's not the question.
[OTH],"Thanks for coming, everybody."
[OTH],"Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at his weight-management camp?"
[OTH],We knew he wouldn't make it.
[OTH],"Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman."
Cartman,"Hey, dudes!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],I don't believe it.
[OTH],Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp.
[OTH],"Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!"
[OTH],Congratulations. How do you feel?
Cartman,I feel awesome!
[OTH],What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
Cartman,"You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy! Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle."
[OTH],I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
Cartman,Memememeee!
[OTH],Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
[OTH],Did you like the old one?
[OTH],Good point.
[OTH],"And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South Park Public Access."
[OTH],"Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength."
Cartman,"No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works."
[OTH],"A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman! Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny?"
Cartman,"God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!"
[OTH],"Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny."
[OTH],(Sure!)
[OTH],Do it again!
[OTH],Do it again!
[OTH],Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!
Cartman,This is ridiculous!
[OTH],"So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?"
[OTH],"We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing."
[OTH],"I can't say I approve of this, my children."
[OTH],Huh? Why not?
[OTH],Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
[OTH],I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit.
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],Yeah! Go for it!
[OTH],What's a prostitute?
[OTH],I don't know.
[OTH],"Hello there, children!"
[OTH],"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
[OTH],"Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! ""Chef, what's the clitoris?"" ""What's a lesbian, Chef?"" ""How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?"" For once, can't you just come in here and say, ""Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?""!"
[OTH],"Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"
[OTH],It sure is! Thank you.
[OTH],"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
[OTH],Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
Cartman,Lunchtime! I'm starved!
[OTH],Oh my God. Eric?
Cartman,That's me.
[OTH],Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
[OTH],Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
[OTH],Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
[OTH],(Yeah. Am I?)
[OTH],"Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute."
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],"Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services."
[OTH],Like what?
[OTH],Like keeping you company. Understand?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children. That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards. That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor."
[OTH],"A prostitute is like any other woman
They all trade somethin' for sex and they do it well."
[OTH],And that's why I say-
[OTH],Prostitutes! Prostitutes! They-
[OTH],"Oohhhh ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here! ...These children tricked me!"
Cartman,"Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy."
Cartman,Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
Cartman,Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
Cartman,"Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!"
Cartman,Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
Cartman,What?!
Cartman,"I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!"
Cartman,Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
Cartman,Twenty.
Cartman,"Suck my balls, 20!"
Cartman,Fine! Then I shall bid you good day!
Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed!"
[OTH],You guys! You have to check this tape out!
[OTH],"Ey, we're trying to study. Finals are tomorrow."
[OTH],"No, dude, check this out! It's a video: this kid, he does all kinds of crazy stuff. Check it out! He jumped into a Porto-Potty at a construction site and stayed there for four days!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],(Ow.)
[OTH],"Oh, gro-hoss"
[OTH],Sick!
[OTH],That's awesome! Hey guys! Check this out!
[OTH],"Get ready for the Krrrrrrazy Kenny Show! And now here's your host, the kid who will do anything to himself for money, Krrrra—a--a-a-azy Kenny! Kenny, through the past weeks we've seen you eat mice, pretend to kill newborn babies to shock their mothers and ...wash your hair with battery acid. The question in all our minds is, who-haht are you gonna do next?"
[OTH],"(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)"
[OTH],"Whoa-ho ho! You heard him, folks! Kenny is going to give a sensual full-body massage to his own grandfather!"
[OTH],Oho! Yeah!
[OTH],Woohoo!
[OTH],Awww! Awgh!
[OTH],Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
Cartman,This is so juvenile.
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you?"
[OTH],"Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?"
Cartman,"Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home?"
[OTH],"Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet."
[OTH],"All beddy-byes for the night, are they?"
[OTH],"I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight."
[OTH],We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it!
[OTH],They'll do it.
[OTH],They'll do it!!
Cartman,"Alright, they're gone! The Cartman store is open!"
[OTH],"Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please."
Cartman,"Two donuts and a pack of licorice. Well, Tony, the usual? Why are you crying, Chad?"
[OTH],"'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this. All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself."
Cartman,"Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend."
[OTH],"I'd, I do?"
Cartman,"Yes. A chocolate friend. Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are. Look at how yummy and sweet he is. ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars. ...There you go."
[OTH],"This week on Pay Per View , Krazy Kenny will crawl up into a woman's uterus and stay there for six hours. Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime event. Order now!"
[OTH],"Alright, so we're back talkin' to three competing celebrities: Tom Green, Johnny Knoxville from MTV's Jackass and Krazy Kenny."
[OTH],"Hey, Howard."
[OTH],"Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View special this week, where he will crawl up into a bus driver's uterus and stay there for six hours."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now."
[OTH],I'm in.
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],(And me!)
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Fine! I'll do it for 40!
[OTH],30.
[OTH],20!
[OTH],(...Ten bucks!)
[OTH],"Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks."
[OTH],Damnit. I'm out.
[OTH],Me too. I guess he is the biggest whore.
[OTH],"Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras?"
[OTH],And we're gonna reach for the sky...
[OTH],Woo-aagh.
[OTH],And down to the ground.
[OTH],Woo-ugh.
[OTH],And up to the sky...
[OTH],Woo-aagh.
[OTH],And down to the ground.
[OTH],Woo-ugh.
[OTH],"Please, Mr. Sanders."
[OTH],No! I have had it!
[OTH],What's happening?
[OTH],Horace's parents want to take him home.
[OTH],Oh! But he's not ready yet.
[OTH],"Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics!"
[OTH],They can lose the weight if they try.
[OTH],Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner! Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that most fat people are just genetically fat!
[OTH],"Please, sir, if you give us one more week,..."
[OTH],Your time is up!
[OTH],"Yeah, your time is up!"
[OTH],And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim their kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time!
[OTH],"But, Dad, I..."
[OTH],What?!
[OTH],...Nothin'.
[OTH],"We're in trouble, Rick."
[OTH],"Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?"
[OTH],HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
[OTH],Six hours.
[OTH],"HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!"
[OTH],Great.
[OTH],You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
[OTH],For what?
[OTH],For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
[OTH],Who-what's a hummer??
[OTH],I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
[OTH],Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
[OTH],I know!
[OTH],"He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus."
Cartman,"You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame."
[OTH],"...Alright, that does it! This has been bothering the hell out of me! I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!"
Cartman,Uh oh.
[OTH],"Well, we've seen him do just about every disgusting thing in the book, and today live on pay-per-view, Krazy Kenny is going to crawl into a woman's uterus for six hours! Well, Ms. Crabtree, your cervix has been dilated, your womb equipped with oxygen- How do you feel?"
[OTH],I feel great! I haven't had this much attention paid to my coot since I was 16!
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the-"
[OTH],"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great."
[OTH],No way! I'm not doing this!
[OTH],"Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!"
[OTH],But this isn't fair!
[OTH],"Deal, druggie!"
[OTH],(But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there!)
[OTH],"And here he is, Kenny McCormick! We can watch him on the video monitors. How are you doin' in there, Kenny?"
[OTH],That's my boy!
[OTH],"Good-bye, Chad."
[OTH],"We'll be wanting our refund, naturally."
[OTH],Naturally.
[OTH],"Good-bye, Alice."
[OTH],Good-bye. Thank you.
[OTH],"Oh, don't thank us. We failed you."
Cartman,"...65, 66, 67..."
[OTH],"Wait a second! This isn't right! It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food!"
Cartman,"Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!"
[OTH],"No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat."
[OTH],"Well, it's alright with me. Parents?"
[OTH],"Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all done you can teach me a thing or two, huh son?"
Cartman,"You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight!"
[OTH],"Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore."
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],Bubbye.
Cartman,"Well, screw you, fatasses!"
[OTH],"Four, three, two, one!"
[OTH],"He did it! Come on out, Kenny! You made it six hours, Kenny. Come on out of there. Hmmm. Uh, Ms. Crabtree, maybe you could give him a little push."
[OTH],OOOOHHHHHH!
[OTH],He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.
[OTH],I told you I was a tight virgin flower.
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of."
[OTH],Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
[OTH],"Well, he gave his life for our amusement. One little boy who dared to be different. Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick. Who was that?"
[OTH],"Come on. Throw the football, Ike."
[OTH],No on dahdo.
[OTH],Dude! You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
[OTH],Hepatitis B?
Cartman,"No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!"
[OTH],...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
[OTH],We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
[OTH],Hold on. I'll be right back.
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?"
[OTH],"No, Kyle."
[OTH],But all the guys are going!
[OTH],"Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile."
[OTH],"But Mom, I-"
[OTH],"The answer is no, Kyle!"
[OTH],Ugh!
[OTH],My parents said I can't go.
[OTH],"Well, of course your parents said you can't go!"
Cartman,"Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!"
[OTH],(Yeah!)
[OTH],"Ah. Oh, now I already told them."
Cartman,"Well, I guess you're screwed, then."
[OTH],No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later.
[OTH],"...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!"
[OTH],"Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!"
[OTH],What's Cuba?
[OTH],A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
[OTH],"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?"
[OTH],The whole thing.
[OTH],"Hoh, geez."
[OTH],Dear Mr. Castro: I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
[OTH],"And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change. Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free I just can't be very happy, that's certain Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish."
[OTH],¡¡Llamen a todos junto!!
[OTH],"Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter. Now the country is again open to American tourism. Plans can finally resume for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba."
[OTH],I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
[OTH],No you can't!
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it."
[OTH],"But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!"
[OTH],"We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert."
[OTH],But that's not fair! You lied to me!
[OTH],"Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-"
[OTH],What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
[OTH],Because we're your parents!
[OTH],Well I wish I didn't have any parents!
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
[OTH],"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it."
[OTH],They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
Cartman,"Well, you... could make them... go away for a while."
[OTH],How?!
Cartman,"Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away."
[OTH],The police?
Cartman,"Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you."
[OTH],What's that?
Cartman,"I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months."
[OTH],Wow! Three months without parents!
[OTH],"(Wow, that is awesome!)"
[OTH],But what do the police do to them?
[OTH],Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
Cartman,"You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like, ""my parents molestered me."""
[OTH],"""My parents molestered me."""
Cartman,"No, but you've gotta cry, like this: ""My parents molestered me."" And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait, you say it was a bad touch."
[OTH],"What's ""bad touch""?"
Cartman,"Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch."""
[OTH],"Okay, molestered, bad touch."
Cartman,"Yeah, And cry. Oh, he's ready."
[OTH],"Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that."
[OTH],"You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right."
[OTH],"Ugh, please, just listen to me! What about my children? Who will take care of them?"
[OTH],"Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother."
[OTH],"Their grandmother's been dead for three years. You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your- mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!"
[OTH],They'll never be able to hurt you again.
[OTH],"Cool, thanks."
[OTH],"Alright, folks. Our work here is done."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too."
Cartman,"Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!"
[OTH],"Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!"
[OTH],The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
Cartman,You guys! Come out here!
[OTH],What's going on?
Cartman,Notice anything? Watch.
[OTH],...Nothing.
Cartman,"Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town. They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested"
[OTH],Not one adult left?
[OTH],...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
[OTH],"Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are."
[OTH],I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?
[OTH],There has to be a town around here somewhere.
[OTH],Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
[OTH],"Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads."
[OTH],"What the? Oh no. No, no, no, no."
[OTH],What's the matter with it?
[OTH],"I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles."
[OTH],"Oh, look! There's a town up ahead. Smiley Town? That's a strange name."
[OTH],"Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles."
[OTH],Hello? Is anybody here?
[OTH],"Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?"
[OTH],"...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car."
[OTH],"Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?"
[OTH],...It's... just you here?
[OTH],"No, uh Craig's here, too."
[OTH],"Oh, good."
[OTH],"But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?"
[OTH],"Huuuhhhh, no."
[OTH],How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?
[OTH],Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
[OTH],Fine! Can you take us there?
[OTH],You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Oh, alright then. Uh, show 'em where it is."
[OTH],"This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line."
[OTH],"Well, can you help us find the phone, please?"
[OTH],Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
[OTH],Why not?!
[OTH],"Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games."
[OTH],Craig.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],It's Spaceman Craig.
[OTH],Carousel.
[OTH],Nah nah nanah nah!
[OTH],"Look, there's an elementary school Come on, there might be some teachers inside."
[OTH],What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??
[OTH],"Linda, it's a remote-controlled car. Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it."
[OTH],"Mark, I don't like this."
[OTH],"Relax, Linda, everything's fine. Ow. Ow."
[OTH],What is it?! Acid?!
[OTH],"No, uh, it's lemon juice."
[OTH],Oh God! Are you blind?!
[OTH],"No, it just really, really, really hurts!"
[OTH],"Mark? Mark, look. Well, hello. What's your name? What- what do you want?"
[OTH],We wanna play.
[OTH],"Mark, I'm scared!"
[OTH],Don't be scared. They're just kids. Where are your parents?!
[OTH],We already played with our parents.
[OTH],"How, we wanna play wit' youuuu."
[OTH],"...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out."
[OTH],We wanna play wit' you!
[OTH],Get off me!
[OTH],"Oh God, Mark! Help!"
[OTH],Oh no! She's crossing the white line!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Spitwads!
[OTH],"Take that, kindergartners!"
[OTH],Ew!
[OTH],What the hell is gong on here?!
[OTH],Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them.
[OTH],"Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!"
[OTH],I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
[OTH],The mayor! Good! Finally!
Cartman,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please? Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions."
[OTH],You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
Cartman,"Parents? Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around."
[OTH],No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
Cartman,"Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!"
[OTH],"Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?"
Cartman,"Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service."
[OTH],"No phones, either? How do you communicate?"
Cartman,"Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat."
[OTH],"Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright?"
[OTH],It's gonna be about three days.
Cartman,"So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too. Ringy-ding?"
[OTH],I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
[OTH],SpitBall!
Cartman,"Aaahh! You sons of bitches! You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need."
[OTH],"Mark, are we doing the right thing?"
[OTH],"Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!"
[OTH],I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
[OTH],"Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!"
[OTH],"Hey, I think you'd make a great father."
[OTH],"Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D- Look, here's the book they've been talking about- it makes no sense."
[OTH],My God! Mark! What is it??
[OTH],It's a boy. They... killed him.
[OTH],"The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here."
[OTH],Nah nah nanah nah!
[OTH],Na-a-ah!
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],Mark!
[OTH],Uh. The fat kid told us to take it.
[OTH],"Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up!"
[OTH],Nah nah nanah nah!
[OTH],"You guys, stop it! Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Why are you doing this?
[OTH],How come you wanna help the fatass?!
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],The fatass. The mayor.
[OTH],"Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than- -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore."
[OTH],"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!"
[OTH],"Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?"
[OTH],"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that."
[OTH],But what about before that?
[OTH],"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?"
[OTH],Yes!!
[OTH],"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?"
[OTH],I'll do anything to get to a phone!
[OTH],Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
[OTH],The Before time.
[OTH],The story of the before time.
[OTH],"Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli."
[OTH],"Yuck, yuck, yuck."
[OTH],"And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word."
[OTH],Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
[OTH],"Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider."
[OTH],Provider. Provider.
[OTH],The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry.
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],Bwack bwack!
[OTH],Coosh!
[OTH],"So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die."
[OTH],"Carousel, Carousel."
[OTH],"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago."
[OTH],"Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?"
[OTH],Yes. No foolies.
[OTH],No foolies.
[OTH],"No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on. Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone."
[OTH],"Mark, I'm scared."
[OTH],"I know, but this will all be over soon."
[OTH],"Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!"
[OTH],"Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?"
[OTH],"Oh, it's awful! Just awful."
[OTH],"Alright parents, let's all take our seats. My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor."
[OTH],"Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child."
[OTH],"Eh, neither did we."
[OTH],"We didn't, either."
[OTH],"Enough, enough! Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with what you lust after most. Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him. Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body."
[OTH],"Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!"
[OTH],"Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!"
[OTH],I don't have any urges!
[OTH],"I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down! Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu. Now let's try again. Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it!"
[OTH],"Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place."
[OTH],"I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper."
[OTH],Oh no. NO! Aaaah!
Cartman,Where is your husband?
[OTH],"Uh, uh..."
Cartman,Seize her!
[OTH],"Alright, I got the book for you."
[OTH],Awesu-home!
[OTH],"Now, can I please have the cell phone?"
[OTH],"Sure, outlander. I'll get it"
Cartman,Outlander!
Cartman,"Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!"
[OTH],Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Cartman,"Butters, calm down, alright?"
[OTH],"Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children?"
[OTH],See a movie?
[OTH],"Sure, ""see a movie""'s good. We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else?"
[OTH],Make a sweater?
[OTH],"Uh huh. I'll put ah, ""knitting, sewing."" Who's got another one?"
[OTH],Molest children?
[OTH],"Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children."
[OTH],Oh. Fishing?
[OTH],Fishing's good. Uh huh.
Cartman,"I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it!"
[OTH],Mmrrhhhh!
Cartman,"Heh, heheh."
[OTH],Rrrmm-mmrrhh!
[OTH],Give him the book back.
[OTH],"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!"
Cartman,"We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!"
[OTH],Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble!
Cartman,The Provider awakes!
[OTH],"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight."
Cartman,"Aw, damnit! Alright. It is decided. Butters, your turn."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!"
[OTH],Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!
[OTH],"Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word."
Cartman,"Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me!"
[OTH],"Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!"
[OTH],Parents?
[OTH],"The birth-givers! Your birth-givers. Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now. They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much. Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this! He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will."
[OTH],Parents. Mom. Dad.
[OTH],"Oh boy, here it comes!"
[OTH],"If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word."
[OTH],"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around."
[OTH],Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
[OTH],Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
Cartman,Take him down.
[OTH],"Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway."
[OTH],"Here's our cell phone, dude. Will you call the police for us?"
[OTH],Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
[OTH],"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some."
[OTH],"Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow!"
[OTH],"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!"
[OTH],Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
[OTH],"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner."
[OTH],"Hey, kids."
[OTH],"Hey, you guys came back!"
[OTH],Did you make it to your job interview?
[OTH],Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
[OTH],And I got my tubes tied.
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Hey! Here they come!
[OTH],Mom! Dad!
[OTH],Kids!
[OTH],"...Come here, come here."
[OTH],"Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK."
[OTH],Yeah. We're fine.
[OTH],"Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now."
[OTH],But you didn't do anything to me.
[OTH],"Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it."
[OTH],It won't happen again.
[OTH],"But, you guys, I--"
[OTH],"Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't."
[OTH],"We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see."
[OTH],"We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on."
[OTH],Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
[OTH],"Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he?"
[OTH],"Everything's gonna be alright now, Jenny. Come on, let's go home."
[OTH],Huh.
[OTH],Huh.
[OTH],"Well, what are you kids gonna do now?"
[OTH],I dunno. You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
[OTH],Sure.
Cartman,Snow igloos kick ass.
[OTH],"Come on. Throw the football, Ike."
[OTH],No on dahdo.
[OTH],Dude! You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
[OTH],Hepatitis B?
Cartman,"No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!"
[OTH],...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
[OTH],We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
[OTH],Hold on. I'll be right back.
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?"
[OTH],"No, Kyle."
[OTH],But all the guys are going!
[OTH],"Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile."
[OTH],"But Mom, I-"
[OTH],"The answer is no, Kyle!"
[OTH],Ugh!
[OTH],My parents said I can't go.
[OTH],"Well, of course your parents said you can't go!"
Cartman,"Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!"
[OTH],(Yeah!)
[OTH],"Ah. Oh, now I already told them."
Cartman,"Well, I guess you're screwed, then."
[OTH],No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later.
[OTH],"...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!"
[OTH],"Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!"
[OTH],What's Cuba?
[OTH],A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
[OTH],"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?"
[OTH],The whole thing.
[OTH],"Hoh, geez."
[OTH],Dear Mr. Castro: I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
[OTH],"And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change. Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free I just can't be very happy, that's certain Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish."
[OTH],¡¡Llamen a todos junto!!
[OTH],"Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter. Now the country is again open to American tourism. Plans can finally resume for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba."
[OTH],I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
[OTH],No you can't!
[OTH],What??
[OTH],"Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it."
[OTH],"But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!"
[OTH],"We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert."
[OTH],But that's not fair! You lied to me!
[OTH],"Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-"
[OTH],What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
[OTH],Because we're your parents!
[OTH],Well I wish I didn't have any parents!
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
[OTH],"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it."
[OTH],They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
Cartman,"Well, you... could make them... go away for a while."
[OTH],How?!
Cartman,"Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away."
[OTH],The police?
Cartman,"Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you."
[OTH],What's that?
Cartman,"I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months."
[OTH],Wow! Three months without parents!
[OTH],"(Wow, that is awesome!)"
[OTH],But what do the police do to them?
[OTH],Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
Cartman,"You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like, ""my parents molestered me."""
[OTH],"""My parents molestered me."""
Cartman,"No, but you've gotta cry, like this: ""My parents molestered me."" And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait, you say it was a bad touch."
[OTH],"What's ""bad touch""?"
Cartman,"Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch."""
[OTH],"Okay, molestered, bad touch."
Cartman,"Yeah, And cry. Oh, he's ready."
[OTH],"Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that."
[OTH],"You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right."
[OTH],"Ugh, please, just listen to me! What about my children? Who will take care of them?"
[OTH],"Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother."
[OTH],"Their grandmother's been dead for three years. You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your- mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!"
[OTH],They'll never be able to hurt you again.
[OTH],"Cool, thanks."
[OTH],"Alright, folks. Our work here is done."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too."
Cartman,"Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!"
[OTH],"Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!"
[OTH],The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
Cartman,You guys! Come out here!
[OTH],What's going on?
Cartman,Notice anything? Watch.
[OTH],...Nothing.
Cartman,"Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town. They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested"
[OTH],Not one adult left?
[OTH],...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
[OTH],"Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are."
[OTH],I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?
[OTH],There has to be a town around here somewhere.
[OTH],Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
[OTH],"Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads."
[OTH],"What the? Oh no. No, no, no, no."
[OTH],What's the matter with it?
[OTH],"I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles."
[OTH],"Oh, look! There's a town up ahead. Smiley Town? That's a strange name."
[OTH],"Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles."
[OTH],Hello? Is anybody here?
[OTH],"Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?"
[OTH],"...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car."
[OTH],"Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?"
[OTH],...It's... just you here?
[OTH],"No, uh Craig's here, too."
[OTH],"Oh, good."
[OTH],"But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?"
[OTH],"Huuuhhhh, no."
[OTH],How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?
[OTH],Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
[OTH],Fine! Can you take us there?
[OTH],You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Oh, alright then. Uh, show 'em where it is."
[OTH],"This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line."
[OTH],"Well, can you help us find the phone, please?"
[OTH],Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
[OTH],Why not?!
[OTH],"Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games."
[OTH],Craig.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],It's Spaceman Craig.
[OTH],Carousel.
[OTH],Nah nah nanah nah!
[OTH],"Look, there's an elementary school Come on, there might be some teachers inside."
[OTH],What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??
[OTH],"Linda, it's a remote-controlled car. Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it."
[OTH],"Mark, I don't like this."
[OTH],"Relax, Linda, everything's fine. Ow. Ow."
[OTH],What is it?! Acid?!
[OTH],"No, uh, it's lemon juice."
[OTH],Oh God! Are you blind?!
[OTH],"No, it just really, really, really hurts!"
[OTH],"Mark? Mark, look. Well, hello. What's your name? What- what do you want?"
[OTH],We wanna play.
[OTH],"Mark, I'm scared!"
[OTH],Don't be scared. They're just kids. Where are your parents?!
[OTH],We already played with our parents.
[OTH],"How, we wanna play wit' youuuu."
[OTH],"...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out."
[OTH],We wanna play wit' you!
[OTH],Get off me!
[OTH],"Oh God, Mark! Help!"
[OTH],Oh no! She's crossing the white line!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Spitwads!
[OTH],"Take that, kindergartners!"
[OTH],Ew!
[OTH],What the hell is gong on here?!
[OTH],Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them.
[OTH],"Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!"
[OTH],I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
[OTH],The mayor! Good! Finally!
Cartman,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please? Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions."
[OTH],You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
Cartman,"Parents? Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around."
[OTH],No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
Cartman,"Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!"
[OTH],"Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?"
Cartman,"Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service."
[OTH],"No phones, either? How do you communicate?"
Cartman,"Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat."
[OTH],"Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright?"
[OTH],It's gonna be about three days.
Cartman,"So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too. Ringy-ding?"
[OTH],I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
[OTH],SpitBall!
Cartman,"Aaahh! You sons of bitches! You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need."
[OTH],"Mark, are we doing the right thing?"
[OTH],"Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!"
[OTH],I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
[OTH],"Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!"
[OTH],"Hey, I think you'd make a great father."
[OTH],"Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D- Look, here's the book they've been talking about- it makes no sense."
[OTH],My God! Mark! What is it??
[OTH],It's a boy. They... killed him.
[OTH],"The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here."
[OTH],Nah nah nanah nah!
[OTH],Na-a-ah!
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],Mark!
[OTH],Uh. The fat kid told us to take it.
[OTH],"Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up!"
[OTH],Nah nah nanah nah!
[OTH],"You guys, stop it! Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Why are you doing this?
[OTH],How come you wanna help the fatass?!
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],The fatass. The mayor.
[OTH],"Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than- -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore."
[OTH],"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!"
[OTH],"Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?"
[OTH],"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that."
[OTH],But what about before that?
[OTH],"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?"
[OTH],Yes!!
[OTH],"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?"
[OTH],I'll do anything to get to a phone!
[OTH],Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
[OTH],The Before time.
[OTH],The story of the before time.
[OTH],"Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli."
[OTH],"Yuck, yuck, yuck."
[OTH],"And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word."
[OTH],Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
[OTH],"Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider."
[OTH],Provider. Provider.
[OTH],The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry.
[OTH],Boo!
[OTH],Bwack bwack!
[OTH],Coosh!
[OTH],"So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die."
[OTH],"Carousel, Carousel."
[OTH],"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago."
[OTH],"Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?"
[OTH],Yes. No foolies.
[OTH],No foolies.
[OTH],"No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on. Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone."
[OTH],"Mark, I'm scared."
[OTH],"I know, but this will all be over soon."
[OTH],"Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!"
[OTH],"Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?"
[OTH],"Oh, it's awful! Just awful."
[OTH],"Alright parents, let's all take our seats. My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor."
[OTH],"Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child."
[OTH],"Eh, neither did we."
[OTH],"We didn't, either."
[OTH],"Enough, enough! Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with what you lust after most. Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him. Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body."
[OTH],"Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!"
[OTH],"Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!"
[OTH],I don't have any urges!
[OTH],"I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down! Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu. Now let's try again. Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it!"
[OTH],"Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place."
[OTH],"I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper."
[OTH],Oh no. NO! Aaaah!
Cartman,Where is your husband?
[OTH],"Uh, uh..."
Cartman,Seize her!
[OTH],"Alright, I got the book for you."
[OTH],Awesu-home!
[OTH],"Now, can I please have the cell phone?"
[OTH],"Sure, outlander. I'll get it"
Cartman,Outlander!
Cartman,"Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!"
[OTH],Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Cartman,"Butters, calm down, alright?"
[OTH],"Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children?"
[OTH],See a movie?
[OTH],"Sure, ""see a movie""'s good. We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else?"
[OTH],Make a sweater?
[OTH],"Uh huh. I'll put ah, ""knitting, sewing."" Who's got another one?"
[OTH],Molest children?
[OTH],"Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children."
[OTH],Oh. Fishing?
[OTH],Fishing's good. Uh huh.
Cartman,"I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it!"
[OTH],Mmrrhhhh!
Cartman,"Heh, heheh."
[OTH],Rrrmm-mmrrhh!
[OTH],Give him the book back.
[OTH],"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!"
Cartman,"We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!"
[OTH],Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble!
Cartman,The Provider awakes!
[OTH],"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight."
Cartman,"Aw, damnit! Alright. It is decided. Butters, your turn."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!"
[OTH],Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!
[OTH],"Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word."
Cartman,"Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me!"
[OTH],"Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!"
[OTH],Parents?
[OTH],"The birth-givers! Your birth-givers. Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now. They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much. Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this! He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will."
[OTH],Parents. Mom. Dad.
[OTH],"Oh boy, here it comes!"
[OTH],"If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word."
[OTH],"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around."
[OTH],Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
[OTH],Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
Cartman,Take him down.
[OTH],"Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway."
[OTH],"Here's our cell phone, dude. Will you call the police for us?"
[OTH],Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
[OTH],"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some."
[OTH],"Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow!"
[OTH],"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!"
[OTH],Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
[OTH],"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner."
[OTH],"Hey, kids."
[OTH],"Hey, you guys came back!"
[OTH],Did you make it to your job interview?
[OTH],Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
[OTH],And I got my tubes tied.
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],"Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Hey! Here they come!
[OTH],Mom! Dad!
[OTH],Kids!
[OTH],"...Come here, come here."
[OTH],"Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK."
[OTH],Yeah. We're fine.
[OTH],"Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now."
[OTH],But you didn't do anything to me.
[OTH],"Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it."
[OTH],It won't happen again.
[OTH],"But, you guys, I--"
[OTH],"Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't."
[OTH],"We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see."
[OTH],"We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on."
[OTH],Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
[OTH],"Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he?"
[OTH],"Everything's gonna be alright now, Jenny. Come on, let's go home."
[OTH],Huh.
[OTH],Huh.
[OTH],"Well, what are you kids gonna do now?"
[OTH],I dunno. You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
[OTH],Sure.
Cartman,Snow igloos kick ass.
[OTH],"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike."
[OTH],"Oooh nooo, poopies."
[OTH],"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike. Come sit by me."
[OTH],"It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed."
[OTH],"Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does."
[OTH],"Alright, bubbe. Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah."
[OTH],"Happy Chanukah, Mom."
[OTH],Ayaaa ta. Weee Weee...
[OTH],Go away!
[OTH],A-ah huh.
[OTH],Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
[OTH],Ho-o-oh.
[OTH],"Okay, good. You're all here."
[OTH],"What is this all about, Kyle?"
[OTH],It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
Cartman,"Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed."
[OTH],"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come."
Cartman,"Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?"
[OTH],"If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!"
Cartman,Heh-tchoo!
[OTH],"Dude, you sneezed on my back!"
Cartman,"Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!"
[OTH],"Hey, look. Hello?"
[OTH],Hoowwddyy ho!
[OTH],"...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-"
[OTH],"Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle."
[OTH],But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
[OTH],"I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family. Honey!"
Cartman,Family?
[OTH],"Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn."
[OTH],Howdy-hey kids! Would you like a drink?
[OTH],"They're too young to drink, honey."
[OTH],"Hey haa, it's Christmas!"
[OTH],"Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids! This is our son, Cornwallis."
[OTH],Hoowwdy Ho!
[OTH],Our daughter Amber.
[OTH],Hoowwdy Ho!
[OTH],"And our son, Simon."
[OTH],"Eee, hey! Hnhn."
[OTH],Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
[OTH],Heh What? Dad? Huh?
[OTH],"Nothin', Simon."
[OTH],A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
[OTH],It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
[OTH],"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore."
Cartman,My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
[OTH],"Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer! And if you want, you can help them."
[OTH],Sure we'll help!
Cartman,Anything for more presents!
[OTH],"""Hic"" Weh-hell, it's a Christmas party! Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes?"
[OTH],"Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?"
[OTH],But it's a Christmas party!
[OTH],"Honey, can we go inside for a second? Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!"
Cartman,"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until- God-damnit! Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole!"
[OTH],Nobody's paying any attention.
[OTH],"Ew, I almost stepped in it."
[OTH],"Well, it was a good effort, boys. But I'm gonna have to close shop. Nobody's buyin' anything an' I can't afford to keep this furnace runnin'! Oh. And, boys, there's some crap on the sidewalk there. Watch out."
[OTH],"Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love."
[OTH],This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
[OTH],"And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS! In an SPC poll, 38% said they were fed up and tired of the holiday, 5% said they were indifferent to it, and a whopping 57% they would quick Bon Jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity."
[OTH],"Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh. I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke."
[OTH],"You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?"
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls."
[OTH],"Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong."
[OTH],In South Park.
[OTH],Oh really?
[OTH],"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing."
[OTH],Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, not this thing again."
[OTH],How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
[OTH],"Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play!"
[OTH],"Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!"
Cartman,"Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act."
[OTH],"And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this."
Cartman,My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
[OTH],"Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it! It's so simple!"
[OTH],"What, dude?"
[OTH],"We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town!"
[OTH],We don't know anything about animation.
[OTH],How hard can it be? Look at it.
Cartman,"Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!"
[OTH],"(Yeah, right! Awesome!)"
[OTH],"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"""
[OTH],"Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!"
[OTH],"Mayor, some adorable children are here to see you."
[OTH],Meugh. Send them in.
[OTH],Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
[OTH],You do?
[OTH],We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
[OTH],"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget."
[OTH],"An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!"
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
[OTH],Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase! Don't you throw that vase!
[OTH],"Ah, Mr. Hankey?"
[OTH],"Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!"
[OTH],"We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card."
[OTH],"Oh, that's swell! Kids! Christmas is back on! We've gotta all go get that old drive-in workin' again."
[OTH],Okay!
[OTH],"That's not the only thing we gotta get workin' again, if you know what I mean..."
[OTH],"Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?"
[OTH],"Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days."
[OTH],"Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry!"
[OTH],"What's the matter, Cornwallis?"
[OTH],"Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got."
[OTH],"Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me."
[OTH],Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
[OTH],"Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus. ""Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff"" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus. ""Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."" ""Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose."" Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys."
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,"Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat."
[OTH],"That's not me, that's you!"
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"They kind of look like us. I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us."
Cartman,I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT!
[OTH],"God job, Butters."
[OTH],"Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film."
[OTH],"No, that's okay."
[OTH],See ya!
[OTH],"Uh-m, alright, alright then. ""Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"" ""Huh, Butters, ma'am."" ""Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"" ""Whoa! Well, uhuh"" ""Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again."""
[OTH],"Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in."
[OTH],"I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad."
[OTH],"Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas."
[OTH],"It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas."
[OTH],"But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!"
[OTH],"Come on, it's time to sit around the tree!"
[OTH],"We're having a talk, honey."
[OTH],God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree!
[OTH],"Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up."
[OTH],That's not the only thing that can't get up around here.
[OTH],"...Now come on, son. Don't be so down."
[OTH],Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us.
[OTH],Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
[OTH],"I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it."
[OTH],"No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?"
[OTH],I'm nothing but crap!
[OTH],"But crap is everything. Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why

Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea. And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal. And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand So it can spring to life and become food for the land! It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end To make food for the humans and start all over again You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life."
[OTH],"But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do."
[OTH],"Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all... you."
[OTH],"I think I see now.
I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground"
[OTH],Becomes the grass of tomorrow
[OTH],Yeah
[OTH],Which the grazers turn around
[OTH],So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen
[OTH],"Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again. That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!"
[OTH],"Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending."
[OTH],"No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later."
[OTH],"Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's."
[OTH],What's a hard p?
Cartman,"You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?"
[OTH],"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],"Uumm, okay, sound is speeding, and..."
[OTH],We wish you a Merry Christmas
[OTH],Hold on.
[OTH],We wish-
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
Cartman,...deh..OOOWW!!!
[OTH],"Uh, mmm. Okay, and?"
[OTH],"We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas--"
[OTH],Hey! Wait a minute!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Well, yes, I think so."
[OTH],"Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs."
[OTH],"Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--"
Cartman,"Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks."
[OTH],"Don't you oppress me, fat boy."
Cartman,"Don't call me fat, buttfucker."
[OTH],Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
[OTH],"You guys, knock it off! We have to record this!"
[OTH],"Dude, that was awesome."
[OTH],What's awesome?
[OTH],The script. It's sweet.
[OTH],That's not in the script They do this all the time.
[OTH],"Well, it should be in the script. All that ""you're fat"" and ""you're a Jew"" and stuff. It's great."
[OTH],"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame."
[OTH],Easy.
[OTH],Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
[OTH],"Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas"
[OTH],"Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads. And then we shoot that for one frame."
[OTH],Okay. One.
[OTH],That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot!
[OTH],Kickass!
[OTH],"Now, the next mouth."
[OTH],"Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas."
[OTH],"Okay, where are the E-mouths?"
[OTH],E mouths...
[OTH],"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?"
[OTH],1 2.
[OTH],So how much done is that?
[OTH],"""We wish you a m- Merry"""
[OTH],"Aw, Jesus Christ!"
[OTH],"This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year."
[OTH],This... place is pretty run-down.
[OTH],"It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming."
[OTH],Hoowwddy ho! Down here!
[OTH],WAAGGH!
[OTH],"Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful."
[OTH],My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
[OTH],"Hi there, Mr. Important Political Person. *hic* You wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes and run naked through this parkin' lot?"
[OTH],"Uh-uh, honey, please don't start!"
[OTH],I didn't start it! He was looking at my breasts!
[OTH],"They're not real, you know."
[OTH],Don't you say that!
[OTH],"Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!"
[OTH],"Uhhh, we'll just leave you to your cleanup."
[OTH],"Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work."
[OTH],"We can fix it up, Dad."
[OTH],"Oh, look! A homeless person. Oh. He looks sad, Papa. There. That's better."
[OTH],"Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy"
[OTH],"Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames."
[OTH],AAAAAAAA!
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!"
[OTH],"That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!"
Cartman,"Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways! Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!"
[OTH],Fine! We'll do it with out you!
[OTH],"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!"
[OTH],We'll dub his voice over.
[OTH],"Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!"
[OTH],"Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.

To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.

You hope, and I'll hurry. You pray, and I'll plan We'll do what's necessary, 'cause Even a miracle needs a hand!"
[OTH],You love-
[OTH],We love
[OTH],-And I'll labor.
[OTH],Tralala
[OTH],You sit-
[OTH],We sit.
[OTH],-And I'll stand.
[OTH],Tralalalala
[OTH],"Get help from our next-door neighbor, 'cause"
[OTH],Even a miracle needs a hand!
[OTH],"You can do Cartman's voice, can't you?"
[OTH],"""Awgh! I'm so fat!"""
[OTH],"Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter."
[OTH],"""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"""
[OTH],Cool! Now let's try the script!
[OTH],Rolling...
[OTH],"Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!"
[OTH],"Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy."
[OTH],Cartman: Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew!
[OTH],You wish-
[OTH],We wish
[OTH],-And I'll whittle.
[OTH],Tralalalala
[OTH],You sit-
[OTH],We sit.
[OTH],-And I'll stand.
[OTH],Tralalalala
[OTH],"Let's all try to help a little, 'cause"
[OTH],Even a miracle-
[OTH],...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film.
[OTH],"Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children."
Cartman,"Thank you, thank you."
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!"
Cartman,"What are you talkin' about, ""quit""? Huh! I don't remember that."
[OTH],"We know that after you see this darling short film, you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?"
[OTH],"Okay, Mr. Hankey!"
[OTH],O-kay!
[OTH],"We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas--"
[OTH],Hey! Wait a minute!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Yeah, I think so."
[OTH],"(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
[OTH],Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
[OTH],"Eehhhh, pretty!"
[OTH],"Oh, that's Christmas for ya."
[OTH],"Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties."
[OTH],Boring.
[OTH],I've gotta go.
[OTH],Stupid.
[OTH],It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
[OTH],All that hard work.
[OTH],"Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!"
[OTH],But we spent it!
[OTH],Fine. Then we'll sue you. Johnson?
[OTH],I... used to believe in miracles.
[OTH],All that work!
[OTH],For nothing.
[OTH],"Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry."
[OTH],"Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey."
Cartman,I guess- we might as well- go home now.
[OTH],It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
[OTH],"But Dad, we can fix the projector."
[OTH],"Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap."
[OTH],"Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything."
[OTH],"Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'"
[OTH],"No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same."
[OTH],Son... You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on!
[OTH],"Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family."
[OTH],I wanna die.
[OTH],What the--
[OTH],(Nooo!!)
[OTH],They did it! They got it working!
[OTH],"You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!"
[OTH],I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
[OTH],Christmas is for celebrating my birth!
[OTH],Christmas is for giving!
[OTH],"Oh, wow!"
[OTH],Mom! They got it working!
[OTH],What's that? They got your father's penis workin' again?
[OTH],...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
[OTH],"Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing."
Cartman,"Yeah, ham."
[OTH],No not ham!
Cartman,Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
[OTH],"Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted."
[OTH],...Christmas is about something much more important!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Presents.
[OTH],Ah.
[OTH],"Don't you see, Kyle?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Presents.
[OTH],...Presents.
[OTH],"My God, they're right!"
[OTH],"Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?"
[OTH],That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
[OTH],"They're starting to understand, Johnson."
[OTH],"We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive."
[OTH],"Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop."
[OTH],"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!"
[OTH],"No, you did it, boys!"
[OTH],"Aw, hell, we all did it!"
[OTH],"Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?"
[OTH],Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
Cartman,Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
[OTH],"Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days."
[OTH],Wow! Count me in!
Cartman,Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
[OTH],"Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made you out of clay
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
With dreidel I will play!"
[OTH],"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike."
[OTH],"Oooh nooo, poopies."
[OTH],"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike. Come sit by me."
[OTH],"It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed."
[OTH],"Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does."
[OTH],"Alright, bubbe. Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah."
[OTH],"Happy Chanukah, Mom."
[OTH],Ayaaa ta. Weee Weee...
[OTH],Go away!
[OTH],A-ah huh.
[OTH],Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
[OTH],Ho-o-oh.
[OTH],"Okay, good. You're all here."
[OTH],"What is this all about, Kyle?"
[OTH],It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
Cartman,"Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed."
[OTH],"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come."
Cartman,"Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?"
[OTH],"If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!"
Cartman,Heh-tchoo!
[OTH],"Dude, you sneezed on my back!"
Cartman,"Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!"
[OTH],"Hey, look. Hello?"
[OTH],Hoowwddyy ho!
[OTH],"...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-"
[OTH],"Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle."
[OTH],But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
[OTH],"I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family. Honey!"
Cartman,Family?
[OTH],"Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn."
[OTH],Howdy-hey kids! Would you like a drink?
[OTH],"They're too young to drink, honey."
[OTH],"Hey haa, it's Christmas!"
[OTH],"Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids! This is our son, Cornwallis."
[OTH],Hoowwdy Ho!
[OTH],Our daughter Amber.
[OTH],Hoowwdy Ho!
[OTH],"And our son, Simon."
[OTH],"Eee, hey! Hnhn."
[OTH],Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
[OTH],Heh What? Dad? Huh?
[OTH],"Nothin', Simon."
[OTH],A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
[OTH],It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
[OTH],"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore."
Cartman,My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
[OTH],"Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer! And if you want, you can help them."
[OTH],Sure we'll help!
Cartman,Anything for more presents!
[OTH],"""Hic"" Weh-hell, it's a Christmas party! Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes?"
[OTH],"Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?"
[OTH],But it's a Christmas party!
[OTH],"Honey, can we go inside for a second? Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!"
Cartman,"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until- God-damnit! Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole!"
[OTH],Nobody's paying any attention.
[OTH],"Ew, I almost stepped in it."
[OTH],"Well, it was a good effort, boys. But I'm gonna have to close shop. Nobody's buyin' anything an' I can't afford to keep this furnace runnin'! Oh. And, boys, there's some crap on the sidewalk there. Watch out."
[OTH],"Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love."
[OTH],This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
[OTH],"And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS! In an SPC poll, 38% said they were fed up and tired of the holiday, 5% said they were indifferent to it, and a whopping 57% they would quick Bon Jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity."
[OTH],"Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh. I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke."
[OTH],"You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?"
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls."
[OTH],"Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong."
[OTH],In South Park.
[OTH],Oh really?
[OTH],"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing."
[OTH],Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, not this thing again."
[OTH],How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
[OTH],"Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play!"
[OTH],"Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!"
Cartman,"Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act."
[OTH],"And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this."
Cartman,My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
[OTH],"Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it! It's so simple!"
[OTH],"What, dude?"
[OTH],"We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town!"
[OTH],We don't know anything about animation.
[OTH],How hard can it be? Look at it.
Cartman,"Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!"
[OTH],"(Yeah, right! Awesome!)"
[OTH],"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"""
[OTH],"Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!"
[OTH],"Mayor, some adorable children are here to see you."
[OTH],Meugh. Send them in.
[OTH],Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
[OTH],You do?
[OTH],We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
[OTH],"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget."
[OTH],"An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!"
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars."
[OTH],Alright!
[OTH],You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
[OTH],Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase! Don't you throw that vase!
[OTH],"Ah, Mr. Hankey?"
[OTH],"Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!"
[OTH],"We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card."
[OTH],"Oh, that's swell! Kids! Christmas is back on! We've gotta all go get that old drive-in workin' again."
[OTH],Okay!
[OTH],"That's not the only thing we gotta get workin' again, if you know what I mean..."
[OTH],"Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?"
[OTH],"Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days."
[OTH],"Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry!"
[OTH],"What's the matter, Cornwallis?"
[OTH],"Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got."
[OTH],"Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me."
[OTH],Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
[OTH],"Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus. ""Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff"" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus. ""Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."" ""Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose."" Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys."
[OTH],Whoa!
Cartman,"Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat."
[OTH],"That's not me, that's you!"
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"They kind of look like us. I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us."
Cartman,I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT!
[OTH],"God job, Butters."
[OTH],"Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film."
[OTH],"No, that's okay."
[OTH],See ya!
[OTH],"Uh-m, alright, alright then. ""Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"" ""Huh, Butters, ma'am."" ""Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"" ""Whoa! Well, uhuh"" ""Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again."""
[OTH],"Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in."
[OTH],"I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad."
[OTH],"Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas."
[OTH],"It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas."
[OTH],"But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!"
[OTH],"Come on, it's time to sit around the tree!"
[OTH],"We're having a talk, honey."
[OTH],God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree!
[OTH],"Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up."
[OTH],That's not the only thing that can't get up around here.
[OTH],"...Now come on, son. Don't be so down."
[OTH],Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us.
[OTH],Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
[OTH],"I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it."
[OTH],"No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?"
[OTH],I'm nothing but crap!
[OTH],"But crap is everything. Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why

Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea. And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal. And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand So it can spring to life and become food for the land! It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end To make food for the humans and start all over again You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life."
[OTH],"But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do."
[OTH],"Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all... you."
[OTH],"I think I see now.
I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground"
[OTH],Becomes the grass of tomorrow
[OTH],Yeah
[OTH],Which the grazers turn around
[OTH],So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen
[OTH],"Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again. That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!"
[OTH],"Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending."
[OTH],"No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later."
[OTH],"Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's."
[OTH],What's a hard p?
Cartman,"You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?"
[OTH],"Oh, yeah."
[OTH],"Uumm, okay, sound is speeding, and..."
[OTH],We wish you a Merry Christmas
[OTH],Hold on.
[OTH],We wish-
[OTH],AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
Cartman,...deh..OOOWW!!!
[OTH],"Uh, mmm. Okay, and?"
[OTH],"We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas--"
[OTH],Hey! Wait a minute!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?"
[OTH],"Well, yes, I think so."
[OTH],"Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs."
[OTH],"Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--"
Cartman,"Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks."
[OTH],"Don't you oppress me, fat boy."
Cartman,"Don't call me fat, buttfucker."
[OTH],Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
[OTH],"You guys, knock it off! We have to record this!"
[OTH],"Dude, that was awesome."
[OTH],What's awesome?
[OTH],The script. It's sweet.
[OTH],That's not in the script They do this all the time.
[OTH],"Well, it should be in the script. All that ""you're fat"" and ""you're a Jew"" and stuff. It's great."
[OTH],"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame."
[OTH],Easy.
[OTH],Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
[OTH],"Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas"
[OTH],"Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads. And then we shoot that for one frame."
[OTH],Okay. One.
[OTH],That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot!
[OTH],Kickass!
[OTH],"Now, the next mouth."
[OTH],"Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas."
[OTH],"Okay, where are the E-mouths?"
[OTH],E mouths...
[OTH],"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?"
[OTH],1 2.
[OTH],So how much done is that?
[OTH],"""We wish you a m- Merry"""
[OTH],"Aw, Jesus Christ!"
[OTH],"This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year."
[OTH],This... place is pretty run-down.
[OTH],"It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming."
[OTH],Hoowwddy ho! Down here!
[OTH],WAAGGH!
[OTH],"Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful."
[OTH],My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
[OTH],"Hi there, Mr. Important Political Person. *hic* You wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes and run naked through this parkin' lot?"
[OTH],"Uh-uh, honey, please don't start!"
[OTH],I didn't start it! He was looking at my breasts!
[OTH],"They're not real, you know."
[OTH],Don't you say that!
[OTH],"Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!"
[OTH],"Uhhh, we'll just leave you to your cleanup."
[OTH],"Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work."
[OTH],"We can fix it up, Dad."
[OTH],"Oh, look! A homeless person. Oh. He looks sad, Papa. There. That's better."
[OTH],"Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy"
[OTH],"Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames."
[OTH],AAAAAAAA!
[OTH],Cartman!
Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!"
[OTH],"That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!"
Cartman,"Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways! Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!"
[OTH],Fine! We'll do it with out you!
[OTH],"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!"
[OTH],We'll dub his voice over.
[OTH],"Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!"
[OTH],"Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.

To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.

You hope, and I'll hurry. You pray, and I'll plan We'll do what's necessary, 'cause Even a miracle needs a hand!"
[OTH],You love-
[OTH],We love
[OTH],-And I'll labor.
[OTH],Tralala
[OTH],You sit-
[OTH],We sit.
[OTH],-And I'll stand.
[OTH],Tralalalala
[OTH],"Get help from our next-door neighbor, 'cause"
[OTH],Even a miracle needs a hand!
[OTH],"You can do Cartman's voice, can't you?"
[OTH],"""Awgh! I'm so fat!"""
[OTH],"Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter."
[OTH],"""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"""
[OTH],Cool! Now let's try the script!
[OTH],Rolling...
[OTH],"Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!"
[OTH],"Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy."
[OTH],Cartman: Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew!
[OTH],You wish-
[OTH],We wish
[OTH],-And I'll whittle.
[OTH],Tralalalala
[OTH],You sit-
[OTH],We sit.
[OTH],-And I'll stand.
[OTH],Tralalalala
[OTH],"Let's all try to help a little, 'cause"
[OTH],Even a miracle-
[OTH],...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film.
[OTH],"Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children."
Cartman,"Thank you, thank you."
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!"
Cartman,"What are you talkin' about, ""quit""? Huh! I don't remember that."
[OTH],"We know that after you see this darling short film, you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?"
[OTH],"Okay, Mr. Hankey!"

[OTH],"Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties."
[OTH],Boring.
[OTH],I've gotta go.
[OTH],Stupid.
[OTH],It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
[OTH],All that hard work.
[OTH],"Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!"
[OTH],But we spent it!
[OTH],Fine. Then we'll sue you. Johnson?
[OTH],I... used to believe in miracles.
[OTH],All that work!
[OTH],For nothing.
[OTH],"Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry."
[OTH],"Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey."
Cartman,I guess- we might as well- go home now.
[OTH],It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
[OTH],"But Dad, we can fix the projector."
[OTH],"Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap."
[OTH],"Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything."
[OTH],"Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'"
[OTH],"No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same."
[OTH],Son... You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on!
[OTH],"Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family."
[OTH],I wanna die.
[OTH],What the--
[OTH],(Nooo!!)
[OTH],They did it! They got it working!
[OTH],"You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!"
[OTH],I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
[OTH],Christmas is for celebrating my birth!
[OTH],Christmas is for giving!
[OTH],"Oh, wow!"
[OTH],Mom! They got it working!
[OTH],What's that? They got your father's penis workin' again?
[OTH],...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
[OTH],"Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing."
Cartman,"Yeah, ham."
[OTH],No not ham!
Cartman,Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
[OTH],"Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted."
[OTH],...Christmas is about something much more important!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Presents.
[OTH],Ah.
[OTH],"Don't you see, Kyle?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Presents.
[OTH],...Presents.
[OTH],"My God, they're right!"
[OTH],"Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?"
[OTH],That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
[OTH],"They're starting to understand, Johnson."
[OTH],"We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive."
[OTH],"Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop."
[OTH],"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!"
[OTH],"No, you did it, boys!"
[OTH],"Aw, hell, we all did it!"
[OTH],"Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?"
[OTH],Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
Cartman,Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
[OTH],"Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days."
[OTH],Wow! Count me in!
Cartman,Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
[OTH],"Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made you out of clay
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
With dreidel I will play!"
[OTH],Hey you guys! Look what I have!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
[OTH],...Oh.
[OTH],"Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool."
[OTH],"Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool."
Cartman,"You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!"
[OTH],"What, doughboy?"
Cartman,I was just- I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
[OTH],So?
Cartman,"So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television."
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,You'll never guess.
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,Guess.
[OTH],"Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?"
Cartman,"You ready? Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say, ""Shit."""
[OTH],"They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?"
[OTH],"They can't say ""shit"" on television!"
Cartman,"It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude."
[OTH],Holy fucking shit!
[OTH],(Dude! We've gotta watch!)
Cartman,Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
[OTH],Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television!"
[OTH],It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
[OTH],"Aw, come, on dude! This is history."
[OTH],It's stupid!
Cartman,"Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?"
[OTH],"No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!"
[OTH],"Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?"
[OTH],"Yeah, they're gonna say ""shit"" on television."
[OTH],"Hey, we should all get together and watch it at the bar."
[OTH],Yeaaahhh!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?
[OTH],"Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show."
[OTH],"And they're gonna say ""shit""!"
[OTH],"Hey, Butters! I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite YOU before anybody else."
[OTH],"Oh, sorry, I can't. They're gonna say ""shit"" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way."
[OTH],How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
[OTH],"Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes!"
[OTH],"Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on the line every day. How dare you accuse me!"
[OTH],"Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes."
[OTH],"I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!"
[OTH],"Oh, was that it? Was that it?!"
[OTH],"Shipped. He said ""shipped""."
[OTH],"I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -"
[OTH],- your job is to protect the men who serve this force.
Cartman,"Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?!"
[OTH],Sh!
[OTH],Maybe... maybe protect them from you?
[OTH],Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to!
[OTH],"And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!"
[OTH],Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.
[OTH],"Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?"
[OTH],"That's it, I've had enough of this."
[OTH],"Don't you turn your back on me, you!"
[OTH],"I said, enough!"
[OTH],Is it?
[OTH],Will it... ever be enough?
[OTH],Cop Drama will return after these messages.
[OTH],"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?"""
Cartman,I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
[OTH],Uh!
[OTH],"Where are you going, Kyle?"
[OTH],I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
[OTH],"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it!"
[OTH],I don't really give a fuck!
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.
[OTH],"Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what."
[OTH],You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.
[OTH],"Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell? You've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks."
[OTH],Wow!!!
[OTH],Whoa!!!
[OTH],Oh!!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],They did it!
[OTH],I can't believe they actually said it.
Cartman,"Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!"
[OTH],Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
Cartman,"Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?"
[OTH],"Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?! Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world? It's still the same old world out there. Look. What the hell?"
Cartman,"Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs."
[OTH],"Oh, whatever."
[OTH],"Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama , broke new ground by saying ""Shit!"" on television, making ""shit"" officially okay to say around the country. A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit. In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community. Rick Watts has the story."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going down here in the small town-"
[OTH],"Whoa, shit!"
[OTH],"Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, ""shit""."
[OTH],"Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?!"
[OTH],This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
[OTH],"Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form."
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance, ""That's a shitty picture of me."" is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of ""This is a picture of shit."" is still naughty."
Cartman,I don't get it.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],"The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example: ""The weather outside is shitty."" However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example: ""My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty."" That's right out!"
[OTH],Sss...sss... shit.
[OTH],"Very good, Timmy."
[OTH],"Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, ""Oh, shit,"" or, ""shit on a shingle""?"
[OTH],"Yes, that's now fine."
Cartman,"Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!"
[OTH],"It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!"
Cartman,"Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina."
[OTH],There's no sand in my vagina!!!
[OTH],"Boys, watch your language! Shit!"
[OTH],"And so, children, instead of saying ""Hand in your papers,"" I may now say, ""Hand in your shit."" Any questions?"
[OTH],"What about, ""I have to take a shit""?"
[OTH],"No! No, Filmore! You can say ""I have to poop and shit,"" or ""Oh, shit, I have to poop,"" but not ""I have to shit."" Are we all clear?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, ""fag"". On television they usually don't allow ""fag"". But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, ""shit,"" that means that finally I am free to say,

Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?
Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do? Oh this is great!"
[OTH],Why that store has such lovely shit.
[OTH],Yeah. Too bad I don't have shit for cash right now.
[OTH],"Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty."
[OTH],"Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit."
[OTH],"Shit, Peter, you look like shit."
[OTH],"No, shit, I feel like shit. I think I-"
[OTH],Holy shit!
[OTH],Did you see that shit?
[OTH],What kind of shit is this?
[OTH],That is some weird shit.
[OTH],"Susan, your shit's ready!"
[OTH],Do you know where this shit goes?
[OTH],Shit if I know.
[OTH],"Nice going, shit-for-brains."
[OTH],"Old McDonald took a shit, E I E I O"
[OTH],No shit!
[OTH],"Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there,-"
[OTH],"Oh, shit, 'scuse me."
[OTH],"Hey, watch it, fag."
[OTH],What did you call me?
[OTH],"I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word ""fag"". So piss off, you fag-shitter! Heh, so hey there, shity shitty fag fagShitty shitty fag fag, ba doop a doop doo"
[OTH],"This sucks. Now that ""shit""'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore."
Cartman,"Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of ""shit"". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob."
[OTH],What's meecrob?
Cartman,"You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob."
[OTH],"You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television."
Cartman,"Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob."
[OTH],"I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death""."
[OTH],What's that?
Cartman,"Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go."
[OTH],"Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on!"
[OTH],"...Seventy-five share. My God, I never thought it was possible."
[OTH],"Sir, your ""shit"" idea has turned the entire network around. We're proud to work for you."
[OTH],"Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity: And, I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say, you are the most creative genius in Hollywood, and... well... I'd let you have me if you wanted."
[OTH],"Thanks, Roger, but I've only just started. You see, I've already figured out our new marketing scheme technique for the next run of shows."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],He's unstoppable!
[OTH],What's the new idea?
[OTH],I can hardly wait.
[OTH],I'm about to piss myself!
[OTH],"This Saturday... on HBC... we're going to say... ""shit"" ...twice."
[OTH],Twice!
[OTH],Brilliant!
[OTH],Think of the repetition!
[OTH],It's like saying it once... but double!
[OTH],"Well gentlemen, let's get on it!"
[OTH],Ho!
[OTH],"Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children."
[OTH],Hey Chef.
[OTH],"Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?"
[OTH],"Uh, from your ass, children."
[OTH],"No no! The word, ""shit""."
[OTH],Oh.
Cartman,"Detective Sandy Vagina here thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick."
[OTH],"Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death""."
[OTH],The Black Death? Are you sure?
[OTH],"What's the Black Death, Chef?"
[OTH],"LaToya Jackson, children."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!
[OTH],"It says here the word, ""shit"" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, ""skite""."
[OTH],"Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague."
[OTH],"This is the oldest book in the library. A priceless original of England's history. Just about everything you could want to know about the plague is in this great tome. Oh, shit. Well, this other book has some good information, too."
[OTH],The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.
[OTH],"Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here."
[OTH],"Look at this, children. It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse."
[OTH],Word of curse?
[OTH],A... curse word.
[OTH],"Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term ""curse word"" before."
[OTH],Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
Cartman,"You guys, look here. In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina."
[OTH],"Cartman, this is serious!!!"
Cartman,"So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb."
[OTH],"If you don't mind, I'll have to close up now. They're going to say ""shit"" seven times on HBC and I-"
[OTH],Holy shit!
Cartman,"Oh-Ho, gross!"
[OTH],"Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire!"
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],(Uh oh.)
Cartman,Kenny's got it. heh heh.
[OTH],"We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network, ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!"
[OTH],"Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and ""shit"", could be linked!"
[OTH],"Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit. And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too. Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service."
Cartman,"Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!"
[OTH],"Cartman, stop being an asshole!"
[OTH],"The ratings are in, sir. We broke another record last night with the show that said ""shit"" seven times!"
[OTH],"Where is the roof on this thing? I mean, I mean, how can we top ourselves now?"
[OTH],"Gentlemen, I have it. The end-all greatest marketing ploy of all time. Tonight, on HBC, we will air all our sitcoms... LIVE. And have everyone say ""shit"" in place of their written lines. And we'll call it ""Must Shit TV""."
[OTH],Bravo!
[OTH],"""Night Of A Million Shits!"""
[OTH],"Now, doing this live will be difficult, so we must-"
[OTH],"Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!"
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about ""shit""."
[OTH],"Oh brother, another Christian protest group."
[OTH],Who wants to take this one?
[OTH],"I'll get it. Gentlemen, we appreciate your concern. Here at HBC the general goal is providing the highest and most thought-provoking entertainment. How great it is that we live in a country where an artist can express himself freely. That's not only the American spirit, it's the HBC spirit. Which allows us to make great family programs like Halo The Turtle, and of course, everyone's favorite show, Cop Drama. We can't thank you enough for bringing your concerns to our network, for it is you, the loyal HBC viewer, who makes this great network, and indeed, the great country that it is."
[OTH],"Alright, now, as I was saying-"
[OTH],Hey! Hold on a minute!
[OTH],"Aw, are they still here?"
[OTH],Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
[OTH],"We think that you might have caused it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word."
[OTH],"Hm, right, right."
[OTH],"It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny."
[OTH],Do you have any proof of this?
[OTH],...No.
[OTH],Then get out of here before we have you thrown out!
Cartman,"But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?"
[OTH],Damn cracker-ass producers!
[OTH],"Now what are we gonna do, Chef?"
[OTH],"I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way."
[OTH],Aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.
[OTH],Oh shit!
[OTH],Stand aside!
[OTH],"Alright, now, we have to get all our biggest names to say ""shit"", and then we're gonna-"
[OTH],Halt your evil plans!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],I possess the Rune Stone of Undoing! Who is in charge here?
[OTH],"Oh... No, you guys didn't hire me a stripper for my birthday- oh, tell me you guys didn't."
[OTH],"Show your true form, Geldon, lest you be afraid! Your short time in this world is at an end! Ach. The Rune Stone has no effect! You are not Geldon!"
[OTH],I never said I was.
[OTH],"You will die anyway, for you have spread the word of curse!"
[OTH],Security!
[OTH],Ach! oh.
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],Take this.
[OTH],What are we supposed to do with it?
[OTH],Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
[OTH],Now what?
[OTH],"We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!"
[OTH],"Lords and Ladies, we bid you welcome to the grandest casino in the land, Excalibur!"
[OTH],Take a free spin. Double your odds.
[OTH],'Scuse me. Do you work here?
[OTH],"How can I help you, noble sir?"
[OTH],We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
[OTH],A what?
[OTH],It might hold the key to a curse.
[OTH],"Uh... I can help get you some credit or a comp meal, perhaps."
[OTH],"Dude, we need help from the British!"
[OTH],"Look kid, This is just a casino. I can't help you. You know, not every British person knows about wizards and dragons and curses."
[OTH],We just need help identifying this.
[OTH],The Rune Stone of Gaelic! Where did you get this?
[OTH],You know what it is?
[OTH],"The Skire once spoke of such a stone! Come, we must see the sorcerer!"
[OTH],"Get ready for ""Must Shit TV""! Starting now, four straight hours of pure shit! It's all live!"
[OTH],"Hey! Heh, shit! Heh. Ya ain't shit."
[OTH],"Yeah. Dude, ya ain't shit!"
[OTH],This is it. My greatest work.
[OTH],Cocktails. Cocktails.
[OTH],These Americans wish to see the Skire!
[OTH],Let us make haste to the inner sanctum!
[OTH],How could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness?!
[OTH],"Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to."
[OTH],"Didn't you realize ""shit"" is a curse word?!"
[OTH],"Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew ""curse word"" meant... curse word."
[OTH],"Ha! Leave it to Americans to think that ""no"" means yes, ""pissed"" means angry, and ""curse word"" means something other than a word that's cursed!!"
[OTH],Let me see the stone.
[OTH],But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.
[OTH],Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place.
[OTH],I've seen this before. Stones that were used by the Knights of Standards and Practices.
[OTH],Knights of Standards and Practices?
[OTH],A legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay. But... they were just a myth.
[OTH],You know what? You're dumb as shit!
[OTH],"Oh yeah?! Well, I don't really give a shit!"
[OTH],"Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore."
[OTH],"Yeah, they're gonna have to come up with a new swear word soon."
[OTH],"Well, they can't use ""fag"". Because you can't say ""fag"" unless you're a homosexual."
[OTH],Really? So we can't say fag?
[OTH],"No. See, you got beeped."
[OTH],You mean you have to be a fag to say fag?
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],"Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say ""fag""."
[OTH],"...Hey, you didn't get beeped."
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],"Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you frickin' fag! You wanna make out or something?"
[OTH],"Oh, man, I am up shit creek."
[OTH],"Serves you right, shit-for-brains!"
[OTH],"Yeah, how could I be such a dumb sh-"
[OTH],Say not the word of curse!
[OTH],What the?
[OTH],Holy shit!
[OTH],"Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!"
[OTH],"The knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum. Should a curse word ever be let out, they would return. A rune for each word of curse was made, representing each of the eight words that so offended God..."
[OTH],"Look, there's the F-word."
[OTH],And asshole.
Cartman,I knew it! Meecrob! Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
[OTH],"Look at this: The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil Geldon , who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed."
[OTH],All the world destroyed?
Cartman,"My house, too?"
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Tonight is the ""Night of a Million Shits"" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!"
[OTH],Then we haven't much time. We must go!
[OTH],Turn off those devices of broadcast!
[OTH],What is going on here?! Stop this shit!
[OTH],We are the Royal Order of Standards and Practices!
[OTH],We command you to stop saying the curse word!
[OTH],"Listen, Mr. Shinypants, I am the head of this network, and I will say ""shit"" all I want! Shit, shit, shit shit shit, shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit, , shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit! Oh, shit!"
[OTH],"And now, back to Must Shit TV, here on HBC."
[OTH],He is too strong! We cannot fight him without the rune stone!
[OTH],"My, my GOD, sir! What have you unleashed upon the world?!"
[OTH],I didn't know. I didn't know!!!
[OTH],"I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all."
[OTH],Wait!
Cartman,"Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina!"
[OTH],The rune stone! Point it towards Geldon!
[OTH],"Agh. Dude, lame. Lame! Bummer, dudes."
Cartman,What a stupid voice.
[OTH],It's okay. The curse has been lifted.
[OTH],Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
[OTH],"You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems."
[OTH],We're all saying the S-word too much!
[OTH],Kyle.
[OTH],"Look, Gerald. Kyle's on television!"
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],"The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances."
[OTH],"And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English."
Cartman,"So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],That makes sense.
[OTH],Ain't that right?
[OTH],Is this still part of the show?
[OTH],"We're sorry, noble knights of Standards and Practices. From now on, we will obey your laws."
[OTH],See that you do!
[OTH],"I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to."
[OTH],Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!
[OTH],"(Yeah, I didn't-"
[OTH],Holy shi- poop.
Cartman,"Hah, I love you guys."
[OTH],Hey you guys! Look what I have!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
[OTH],...Oh.
[OTH],"Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool."
[OTH],"Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool."
Cartman,"You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!"
[OTH],"What, doughboy?"
Cartman,I was just- I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
[OTH],So?
Cartman,"So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama."
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television."
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,You'll never guess.
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,Guess.
[OTH],"Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?"
Cartman,"You ready? Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say, ""Shit."""
[OTH],"They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?"
[OTH],"They can't say ""shit"" on television!"
Cartman,"It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude."
[OTH],Holy fucking shit!
[OTH],(Dude! We've gotta watch!)
Cartman,Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
[OTH],Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television!"
[OTH],It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
[OTH],"Aw, come, on dude! This is history."
[OTH],It's stupid!
Cartman,"Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?"
[OTH],"No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!"
[OTH],"Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?"
[OTH],"Yeah, they're gonna say ""shit"" on television."
[OTH],"Hey, we should all get together and watch it at the bar."
[OTH],Yeaaahhh!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?
[OTH],"Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show."
[OTH],"And they're gonna say ""shit""!"
[OTH],"Hey, Butters! I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite YOU before anybody else."
[OTH],"Oh, sorry, I can't. They're gonna say ""shit"" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way."
[OTH],How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
[OTH],"Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes!"
[OTH],"Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on the line every day. How dare you accuse me!"
[OTH],"Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes."
[OTH],"I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!"
[OTH],"Oh, was that it? Was that it?!"
[OTH],"Shipped. He said ""shipped""."
[OTH],"I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -"
[OTH],- your job is to protect the men who serve this force.
Cartman,"Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?!"
[OTH],Sh!
[OTH],Maybe... maybe protect them from you?
[OTH],Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to!
[OTH],"And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!"
[OTH],Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.
[OTH],"Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?"
[OTH],"That's it, I've had enough of this."
[OTH],"Don't you turn your back on me, you!"
[OTH],"I said, enough!"
[OTH],Is it?
[OTH],Will it... ever be enough?
[OTH],Cop Drama will return after these messages.
[OTH],"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?"""
Cartman,I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
[OTH],Uh!
[OTH],"Where are you going, Kyle?"
[OTH],I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
[OTH],"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it!"
[OTH],I don't really give a fuck!
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.
[OTH],"Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what."
[OTH],You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.
[OTH],"Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell? You've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks."
[OTH],Wow!!!
[OTH],Whoa!!!
[OTH],Oh!!
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],They did it!
[OTH],I can't believe they actually said it.
Cartman,"Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!"
[OTH],Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
Cartman,"Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?"
[OTH],"Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?! Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world? It's still the same old world out there. Look. What the hell?"
Cartman,"Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs."
[OTH],"Oh, whatever."
[OTH],"Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama , broke new ground by saying ""Shit!"" on television, making ""shit"" officially okay to say around the country. A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit. In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community. Rick Watts has the story."
[OTH],"Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going down here in the small town-"
[OTH],"Whoa, shit!"
[OTH],"Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, ""shit""."
[OTH],"Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?!"
[OTH],This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
[OTH],"Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form."
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],"You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance, ""That's a shitty picture of me."" is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of ""This is a picture of shit."" is still naughty."
Cartman,I don't get it.
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],"The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example: ""The weather outside is shitty."" However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example: ""My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty."" That's right out!"
[OTH],Sss...sss... shit.
[OTH],"Very good, Timmy."
[OTH],"Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, ""Oh, shit,"" or, ""shit on a shingle""?"
[OTH],"Yes, that's now fine."
Cartman,"Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!"
[OTH],"It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!"
Cartman,"Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina."
[OTH],There's no sand in my vagina!!!
[OTH],"Boys, watch your language! Shit!"
[OTH],"And so, children, instead of saying ""Hand in your papers,"" I may now say, ""Hand in your shit."" Any questions?"
[OTH],"What about, ""I have to take a shit""?"
[OTH],"No! No, Filmore! You can say ""I have to poop and shit,"" or ""Oh, shit, I have to poop,"" but not ""I have to shit."" Are we all clear?"
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, ""fag"". On television they usually don't allow ""fag"". But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, ""shit,"" that means that finally I am free to say,

Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?
Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do? Oh this is great!"
[OTH],Why that store has such lovely shit.
[OTH],Yeah. Too bad I don't have shit for cash right now.
[OTH],"Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty."
[OTH],"Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit."
[OTH],"Shit, Peter, you look like shit."
[OTH],"No, shit, I feel like shit. I think I-"
[OTH],Holy shit!
[OTH],Did you see that shit?
[OTH],What kind of shit is this?
[OTH],That is some weird shit.
[OTH],"Susan, your shit's ready!"
[OTH],Do you know where this shit goes?
[OTH],Shit if I know.
[OTH],"Nice going, shit-for-brains."
[OTH],"Old McDonald took a shit, E I E I O"
[OTH],No shit!
[OTH],"Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there,-"
[OTH],"Oh, shit, 'scuse me."
[OTH],"Hey, watch it, fag."
[OTH],What did you call me?
[OTH],"I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word ""fag"". So piss off, you fag-shitter! Heh, so hey there, shity shitty fag fagShitty shitty fag fag, ba doop a doop doo"
[OTH],"This sucks. Now that ""shit""'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore."
Cartman,"Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of ""shit"". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob."
[OTH],What's meecrob?
Cartman,"You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob."
[OTH],"You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television."
Cartman,"Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob."
[OTH],"I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death""."
[OTH],What's that?
Cartman,"Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go."
[OTH],"Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on!"
[OTH],"...Seventy-five share. My God, I never thought it was possible."
[OTH],"Sir, your ""shit"" idea has turned the entire network around. We're proud to work for you."
[OTH],"Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity: And, I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say, you are the most creative genius in Hollywood, and... well... I'd let you have me if you wanted."
[OTH],"Thanks, Roger, but I've only just started. You see, I've already figured out our new marketing scheme technique for the next run of shows."
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],He's unstoppable!
[OTH],What's the new idea?
[OTH],I can hardly wait.
[OTH],I'm about to piss myself!
[OTH],"This Saturday... on HBC... we're going to say... ""shit"" ...twice."
[OTH],Twice!
[OTH],Brilliant!
[OTH],Think of the repetition!
[OTH],It's like saying it once... but double!
[OTH],"Well gentlemen, let's get on it!"
[OTH],Ho!
[OTH],"Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children."
[OTH],Hey Chef.
[OTH],"Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?"
[OTH],"Uh, from your ass, children."
[OTH],"No no! The word, ""shit""."
[OTH],Oh.
Cartman,"Detective Sandy Vagina here thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick."
[OTH],"Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death""."
[OTH],The Black Death? Are you sure?
[OTH],"What's the Black Death, Chef?"
[OTH],"LaToya Jackson, children."
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!
[OTH],"It says here the word, ""shit"" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, ""skite""."
[OTH],"Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague."
[OTH],"This is the oldest book in the library. A priceless original of England's history. Just about everything you could want to know about the plague is in this great tome. Oh, shit. Well, this other book has some good information, too."
[OTH],The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.
[OTH],"Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here."
[OTH],"Look at this, children. It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse."
[OTH],Word of curse?
[OTH],A... curse word.
[OTH],"Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term ""curse word"" before."
[OTH],Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
Cartman,"You guys, look here. In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina."
[OTH],"Cartman, this is serious!!!"
Cartman,"So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb."
[OTH],"If you don't mind, I'll have to close up now. They're going to say ""shit"" seven times on HBC and I-"
[OTH],Holy shit!
Cartman,"Oh-Ho, gross!"
[OTH],"Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire!"
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],(Uh oh.)
Cartman,Kenny's got it. heh heh.
[OTH],"We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network, ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!"
[OTH],"Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and ""shit"", could be linked!"
[OTH],"Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit. And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too. Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service."
Cartman,"Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!"
[OTH],"Cartman, stop being an asshole!"
[OTH],"The ratings are in, sir. We broke another record last night with the show that said ""shit"" seven times!"
[OTH],"Where is the roof on this thing? I mean, I mean, how can we top ourselves now?"
[OTH],"Gentlemen, I have it. The end-all greatest marketing ploy of all time. Tonight, on HBC, we will air all our sitcoms... LIVE. And have everyone say ""shit"" in place of their written lines. And we'll call it ""Must Shit TV""."
[OTH],Bravo!
[OTH],"""Night Of A Million Shits!"""
[OTH],"Now, doing this live will be difficult, so we must-"
[OTH],"Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!"
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about ""shit""."
[OTH],"Oh brother, another Christian protest group."
[OTH],Who wants to take this one?
[OTH],"I'll get it. Gentlemen, we appreciate your concern. Here at HBC the general goal is providing the highest and most thought-provoking entertainment. How great it is that we live in a country where an artist can express himself freely. That's not only the American spirit, it's the HBC spirit. Which allows us to make great family programs like Halo The Turtle, and of course, everyone's favorite show, Cop Drama. We can't thank you enough for bringing your concerns to our network, for it is you, the loyal HBC viewer, who makes this great network, and indeed, the great country that it is."
[OTH],"Alright, now, as I was saying-"
[OTH],Hey! Hold on a minute!
[OTH],"Aw, are they still here?"
[OTH],Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
[OTH],"We think that you might have caused it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word."
[OTH],"Hm, right, right."
[OTH],"It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny."
[OTH],Do you have any proof of this?
[OTH],...No.
[OTH],Then get out of here before we have you thrown out!
Cartman,"But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?"
[OTH],Damn cracker-ass producers!
[OTH],"Now what are we gonna do, Chef?"
[OTH],"I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way."
[OTH],Aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.
[OTH],Oh shit!
[OTH],Stand aside!
[OTH],"Alright, now, we have to get all our biggest names to say ""shit"", and then we're gonna-"
[OTH],Halt your evil plans!
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],I possess the Rune Stone of Undoing! Who is in charge here?
[OTH],"Oh... No, you guys didn't hire me a stripper for my birthday- oh, tell me you guys didn't."
[OTH],"Show your true form, Geldon, lest you be afraid! Your short time in this world is at an end! Ach. The Rune Stone has no effect! You are not Geldon!"
[OTH],I never said I was.
[OTH],"You will die anyway, for you have spread the word of curse!"
[OTH],Security!
[OTH],Ach! oh.
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],Take this.
[OTH],What are we supposed to do with it?
[OTH],Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
[OTH],Now what?
[OTH],"We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!"
[OTH],"Lords and Ladies, we bid you welcome to the grandest casino in the land, Excalibur!"
[OTH],Take a free spin. Double your odds.
[OTH],'Scuse me. Do you work here?
[OTH],"How can I help you, noble sir?"
[OTH],We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
[OTH],A what?
[OTH],It might hold the key to a curse.
[OTH],"Uh... I can help get you some credit or a comp meal, perhaps."
[OTH],"Dude, we need help from the British!"
[OTH],"Look kid, This is just a casino. I can't help you. You know, not every British person knows about wizards and dragons and curses."
[OTH],We just need help identifying this.
[OTH],The Rune Stone of Gaelic! Where did you get this?
[OTH],You know what it is?
[OTH],"The Skire once spoke of such a stone! Come, we must see the sorcerer!"
[OTH],"Get ready for ""Must Shit TV""! Starting now, four straight hours of pure shit! It's all live!"
[OTH],"Hey! Heh, shit! Heh. Ya ain't shit."
[OTH],"Yeah. Dude, ya ain't shit!"
[OTH],This is it. My greatest work.
[OTH],Cocktails. Cocktails.
[OTH],These Americans wish to see the Skire!
[OTH],Let us make haste to the inner sanctum!
[OTH],How could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness?!
[OTH],"Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to."
[OTH],"Didn't you realize ""shit"" is a curse word?!"
[OTH],"Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew ""curse word"" meant... curse word."
[OTH],"Ha! Leave it to Americans to think that ""no"" means yes, ""pissed"" means angry, and ""curse word"" means something other than a word that's cursed!!"
[OTH],Let me see the stone.
[OTH],But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.
[OTH],Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place.
[OTH],I've seen this before. Stones that were used by the Knights of Standards and Practices.
[OTH],Knights of Standards and Practices?
[OTH],A legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay. But... they were just a myth.
[OTH],You know what? You're dumb as shit!
[OTH],"Oh yeah?! Well, I don't really give a shit!"
[OTH],"Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore."
[OTH],"Yeah, they're gonna have to come up with a new swear word soon."
[OTH],"Well, they can't use ""fag"". Because you can't say ""fag"" unless you're a homosexual."
[OTH],Really? So we can't say fag?
[OTH],"No. See, you got beeped."
[OTH],You mean you have to be a fag to say fag?
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],"Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say ""fag""."
[OTH],"...Hey, you didn't get beeped."
[OTH],Uh oh.
[OTH],"Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you frickin' fag! You wanna make out or something?"
[OTH],"Oh, man, I am up shit creek."
[OTH],"Serves you right, shit-for-brains!"
[OTH],"Yeah, how could I be such a dumb sh-"
[OTH],Say not the word of curse!
[OTH],What the?
[OTH],Holy shit!
[OTH],"Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!"
[OTH],"The knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum. Should a curse word ever be let out, they would return. A rune for each word of curse was made, representing each of the eight words that so offended God..."
[OTH],"Look, there's the F-word."
[OTH],And asshole.
Cartman,I knew it! Meecrob! Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
[OTH],"Look at this: The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil Geldon , who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed."
[OTH],All the world destroyed?
Cartman,"My house, too?"
[OTH],Oh no!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Tonight is the ""Night of a Million Shits"" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!"
[OTH],Then we haven't much time. We must go!
[OTH],Turn off those devices of broadcast!
[OTH],What is going on here?! Stop this shit!
[OTH],We are the Royal Order of Standards and Practices!
[OTH],We command you to stop saying the curse word!
[OTH],"Listen, Mr. Shinypants, I am the head of this network, and I will say ""shit"" all I want! Shit, shit, shit shit shit, shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit, , shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit! Oh, shit!"
[OTH],"And now, back to Must Shit TV, here on HBC."
[OTH],He is too strong! We cannot fight him without the rune stone!
[OTH],"My, my GOD, sir! What have you unleashed upon the world?!"
[OTH],I didn't know. I didn't know!!!
[OTH],"I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all."
[OTH],Wait!
Cartman,"Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina!"
[OTH],The rune stone! Point it towards Geldon!
[OTH],"Agh. Dude, lame. Lame! Bummer, dudes."
Cartman,What a stupid voice.
[OTH],It's okay. The curse has been lifted.
[OTH],Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
[OTH],"You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems."
[OTH],We're all saying the S-word too much!
[OTH],Kyle.
[OTH],"Look, Gerald. Kyle's on television!"
[OTH],Uh huh.
[OTH],"The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances."
[OTH],"And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English."
Cartman,"So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],That makes sense.
[OTH],Ain't that right?
[OTH],Is this still part of the show?
[OTH],"We're sorry, noble knights of Standards and Practices. From now on, we will obey your laws."
[OTH],See that you do!
[OTH],"I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to."
[OTH],Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!
[OTH],"(Yeah, I didn't-"
[OTH],Holy shi- poop.
Cartman,"Hah, I love you guys."
[OTH],"Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts."
[OTH],"It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"Well, now, that's part of the fun."
[OTH],Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
[OTH],"Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad."
Cartman,That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
[OTH],"Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??"
[OTH],Hyeah Timmay!
Cartman,"Yeah, he's excited."
[OTH],"Hey, fellas!"
Cartman,"Hey, Butters."
[OTH],"Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody."
[OTH],"Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine."
[OTH],You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
[OTH],Hello scouts!
[OTH],"Hey, it's Big Gay Al!"
[OTH],"Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!"
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],You're the new scout leader?
[OTH],"I just got transferred in. I think everyone's here now, so we can get started. Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"See ya, Dad!"
[OTH],"Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses. Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!"
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy!
[OTH],Well hello everyone.
[OTH],Ji- Jimmay?
[OTH],"Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!"
[OTH],He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
[OTH],Well how gay is he?
[OTH],"He's really, really gay."
[OTH],"Well then, I don't want my boy there, either."
[OTH],So he's a homosexual. So what?
[OTH],"I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??"
[OTH],"You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls."
[OTH],"Aw, that's ridiculous."
[OTH],"People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back."
[OTH],"That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!"
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],You did.
[OTH],"And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy. Let's give him a big hand."
[OTH],"Wow, what a great audience. Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B. You guys like im- personations?"
[OTH],Timmy.
[OTH],"How about Jimmy Stewart? ""Merry Christmas, movie house."" And John Travolta. ""Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"""
[OTH],"Jimmy's funny, dude."
[OTH],"Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!"
[OTH],Hmph!
[OTH],"Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock."
[OTH],"Come on, Stanley."
[OTH],"Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck."
[OTH],"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?"
Cartman,"Hey, yeah!"
[OTH],Timmuh Timmy Timmy Timmy.
[OTH],"Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?"
[OTH],"Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas."
[OTH],"Come on, Stan."
[OTH],"Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time."
[OTH],"(Yeah, see ya.)"
Cartman,"Bye, Jimmy."
[OTH],"See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas."
[OTH],"You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!"
[OTH],(Yeah!)
[OTH],"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!"
Cartman,"Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale."
[OTH],"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!"
[OTH],Yahahah!!!
Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale."
[OTH],"Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose."
[OTH],Ah.
[OTH],What did you say?!
[OTH],"I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose."
[OTH],Uh huh!
[OTH],"You do not say ""Big silly goose""! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!"
[OTH],"Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-"
[OTH],"Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!"
[OTH],...Asshole.
[OTH],That's better.
Cartman,"Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch."
[OTH],"Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy!"
[OTH],"Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired! What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""Are you angry at God for making disabled people?"" I say, ""No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush."""
[OTH],What a brave little boy.
[OTH],He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him!
[OTH],"Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park. H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? ""Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!"""
Cartman,"Hehe, I don't sound like that."
[OTH],"And how about that school counselor? ""Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad."" ""Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?"" Wow, what a great audience. ""Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-"" ""Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat"" ""I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch."" ""Salisbury steak for lunch."" Eh. Uh. ""Goddamnit, Goddamnit!"" And of course, my very favorite, ""Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!"" ""Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy."" Heh. Sometimes it's like, ""Please, Timmy, learn a new word,"" heh. ""Timmy! Tu-Timmy!"""
[OTH],Aaaaaaah!
[OTH],"Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake."
[OTH],Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my
[OTH],Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!
[OTH],"Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice."
[OTH],Hi ya fellas!
[OTH],"How are you today, Scout?"
[OTH],"I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie!"
[OTH],"Uh, Big Gay Al, it's recently come to our attention that you are... gay."
[OTH],"Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?"
[OTH],"Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the Scouts have a policy that openly gay men cannot belong."
[OTH],"We are left with no options, Mr. Al. I'm afraid you are hereby... out of Scouts."
[OTH],Out of... Scouts?
[OTH],"We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al."
[OTH],But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life.
[OTH],"Uh, you must understand that Scouts is a private club. A club that follows certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs is that homosexuality is immoral."
[OTH],I see...
[OTH],It's nothing against you personally
[OTH],What if I promise not to be gay anymore? Pinky swear.
[OTH],We think it's best you just... move on.
[OTH],Right. Move on.
[OTH],"Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet."
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],"Hur livin' a lah, Timmih."
[OTH],A present? You got me a p-present?
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"... Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent. If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh? Wow, a parka. You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim."
[OTH],Tim-Timmy.
[OTH],"Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits. This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around."
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"There he is! Kill him! Kill him! Oh, wait, that's not him."
[OTH],"Thanks again, Tim-Tim."
[OTH],Tim-Timmay!
[OTH],"Ah, bye, Scouts. Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now."
[OTH],"Hey, don't yell at me! Ya asked me to come over and play sad songs for you to pack to, and then ya yell at me."
[OTH],"I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything away, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... ""I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay"" music."
[OTH],"Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have her. She's too fat for me."
[OTH],"Oh! Jesus, Marc."
[OTH],"Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual."
[OTH],Nice to meet you.
[OTH],"Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends."
[OTH],"Your wife, huh?"
[OTH],Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop.
[OTH],"Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then."
[OTH],"Gonna go pound some brews, huh?"
[OTH],"And so I said to him, ""Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf."" Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?"
[OTH],Timmay.
[OTH],"Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim. Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too. Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat. Just for a second, Timmy. Don't be a jerk, Timmy. Hey, don't push me!"
[OTH],Timmih!
Cartman,Cripple fight!
[OTH],"That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats!"
Cartman,Awww!
[OTH],"Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier! Together we are going to become the best! The sleekest! The most polished Scout troop in all of Colorado! Isn't that right! When I ask you a question you will answer ""Yes, Scoutmaster!"" Do I make myself clear?!"
[OTH],"Yes, Scoutmaster!"
[OTH],"Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be... naked pictures I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! ""We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"""
Cartman,"Man, this guy sucks."
[OTH],"Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!"
[OTH],"Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show. Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready. Now, here's a little Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier took naked pictures of him. Look what happens. Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw! Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!"
[OTH],"Yes, Scoutmaster!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's all the time we have for tonight, Scouts. We sure had a great time, didn't we?"
[OTH],Yes sir Scoutmaster!
[OTH],"Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape."
[OTH],Yeah. Now they're acting like men.
[OTH],"Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside."
[OTH],You bet.
[OTH],I heard that.
[OTH],"See ya, Mr. Grazier."
[OTH],Go away! I'm dead!
[OTH],"Oh, well, here he is."
[OTH],"Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!"
Cartman,Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
[OTH],"I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts."
[OTH],Kicked out? Oh no!
Cartman,But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
[OTH],Really? wull-why?
[OTH],We can't tell you.
[OTH],Why not?
[OTH],"Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no!"
[OTH],"Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week."
[OTH],"Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals."
[OTH],"Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much."
[OTH],What do we want?
[OTH],Gays in Scouts!
[OTH],When do we want it?
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],What do we want?
[OTH],Gays in Scouts!
[OTH],When do we want it?
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],What do we want?
[OTH],"Oh, no."
[OTH],Gays in Scouts!
[OTH],When do we want it?
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],What do we want?
[OTH],Gays in Scouts!
[OTH],When do we want it?
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures."
[OTH],Puppies. Puppies for sale.
Cartman,"Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do!"
[OTH],"Alright, let's set up. Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays? Uh, hello, gays in Scouts? Goddamnit!"
[OTH],"Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?"
[OTH],"That's a great idea! Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!"
[OTH],"Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim. Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!"
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!"
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],Put on the hat!
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],Pu-put it on!!
[OTH],"Dude, this looks like it could get ugly."
[OTH],Timmih. Timmih.
[OTH],Not this year.
[OTH],"Timmih, Timmih."
Cartman,Cripple fight!
[OTH],Haaa.
[OTH],Come on. Come on!
[OTH],Timmih.
Cartman,Cripple fight!
Cartman,"Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside!"
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],Uh.
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, dude!"
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon."
[OTH],Hahnah Timmih.
[OTH],Huah!
[OTH],Hahnah Timmih.
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],No! Ow!
[OTH],Timmy? Timmy? I told you to put on the HAT!! You dirty motherfucker!
[OTH],What's goin' on?
[OTH],Some kind of gay pride rally.
[OTH],Lah-livin' a lie!
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice."
[OTH],Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.
[OTH],This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
[OTH],"Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off."
[OTH],"The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as Always and 1941."
[OTH],I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!
[OTH],"The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred."
[OTH],"It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate. I am taking this case on, personally!"
[OTH],"With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you."
[OTH],"Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist. This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now."
[OTH],Here's one. And here's another.
[OTH],Kenny?
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],"Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here."
[OTH],"Alright, boys, break it up."
[OTH],All rise.
[OTH],"In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!"
[OTH],Alright! Yeah! Woohoo!
[OTH],"Well, we've all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!"
[OTH],"Hooray, yeah, yeah!"
[OTH],We did it! We did it!
[OTH],I did it! I did it! Haha!
[OTH],"Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are. And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al."
[OTH],Thank you all very much. But I don't want this.
[OTH],What's he saying?
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club."
[OTH],"Uh, Hooray!"
[OTH],"Hooray, hey!"
[OTH],"So wait, did we do good?"
[OTH],"Uh yeah, ah I think so."
Cartman,"Eh, we kick ass."
[OTH],"Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream!"
[OTH],You can't do this! You homophobe!
[OTH],"Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts."
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts.
[OTH],Tim-mih.
[OTH],"Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih... Timmih Timmih Timmih.
Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih... Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih. 
Ahh!"
[OTH],"Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts!"
[OTH],"Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader. Everything is going to be just fine. No naked pictures."
[OTH],"Uh, Timmih."
[OTH],"Yes, Timmy? Oh dear. Jimmy?"
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts.
[OTH],Out of Scouts?
[OTH],Tim-mih.
[OTH],What? Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
[OTH],"Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay."
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],No! No!
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],"Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts."
[OTH],"It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know."
[OTH],(Yeah.)
[OTH],"Well, now, that's part of the fun."
[OTH],Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
[OTH],"Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad."
Cartman,That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
[OTH],"Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??"
[OTH],Hyeah Timmay!
Cartman,"Yeah, he's excited."
[OTH],"Hey, fellas!"
Cartman,"Hey, Butters."
[OTH],"Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody."
[OTH],"Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine."
[OTH],You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
[OTH],Hello scouts!
[OTH],"Hey, it's Big Gay Al!"
[OTH],"Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!"
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],You're the new scout leader?
[OTH],"I just got transferred in. I think everyone's here now, so we can get started. Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do!"
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"See ya, Dad!"
[OTH],"Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses. Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!"
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy!
[OTH],Well hello everyone.
[OTH],Ji- Jimmay?
[OTH],"Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!"
[OTH],He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
[OTH],Well how gay is he?
[OTH],"He's really, really gay."
[OTH],"Well then, I don't want my boy there, either."
[OTH],So he's a homosexual. So what?
[OTH],"I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??"
[OTH],"You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls."
[OTH],"Aw, that's ridiculous."
[OTH],"People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back."
[OTH],"That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!"
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],You did.
[OTH],"And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy. Let's give him a big hand."
[OTH],"Wow, what a great audience. Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B. You guys like im- personations?"
[OTH],Timmy.
[OTH],"How about Jimmy Stewart? ""Merry Christmas, movie house."" And John Travolta. ""Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"""
[OTH],"Jimmy's funny, dude."
[OTH],"Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!"
[OTH],Hmph!
[OTH],"Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock."
[OTH],"Come on, Stanley."
[OTH],"Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck."
[OTH],"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?"
Cartman,"Hey, yeah!"
[OTH],Timmuh Timmy Timmy Timmy.
[OTH],"Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?"
[OTH],"Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas."
[OTH],"Come on, Stan."
[OTH],"Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time."
[OTH],"(Yeah, see ya.)"
Cartman,"Bye, Jimmy."
[OTH],"See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas."
[OTH],"You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!"
[OTH],(Yeah!)
[OTH],"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!"
Cartman,"Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale."
[OTH],"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!"
[OTH],Yahahah!!!
Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale."
[OTH],"Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose."
[OTH],Ah.
[OTH],What did you say?!
[OTH],"I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose."
[OTH],Uh huh!
[OTH],"You do not say ""Big silly goose""! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!"
[OTH],"Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-"
[OTH],"Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!"
[OTH],...Asshole.
[OTH],That's better.
Cartman,"Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch."
[OTH],"Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy!"
[OTH],"Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired! What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""Are you angry at God for making disabled people?"" I say, ""No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush."""

Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-"" ""Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat"" ""I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch."" ""Salisbury steak for lunch."" Eh. Uh. ""Goddamnit, Goddamnit!"" And of course, my very favorite, ""Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!"" ""Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy."" Heh. Sometimes it's like, ""Please, Timmy, learn a new word,"" heh. ""Timmy! Tu-Timmy!"""
[OTH],Aaaaaaah!
[OTH],"Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake."
[OTH],Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my
[OTH],Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!
[OTH],"Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice."

[OTH],"Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim. Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too. Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat. Just for a second, Timmy. Don't be a jerk, Timmy. Hey, don't push me!"
[OTH],Timmih!
Cartman,Cripple fight!
[OTH],"That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats!"
Cartman,Awww!
[OTH],"Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier! Together we are going to become the best! The sleekest! The most polished Scout troop in all of Colorado! Isn't that right! When I ask you a question you will answer ""Yes, Scoutmaster!"" Do I make myself clear?!"
[OTH],"Yes, Scoutmaster!"
[OTH],"Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be... naked pictures I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later."
[OTH],Awww.
[OTH],"Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! ""We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"""
Cartman,"Man, this guy sucks."
[OTH],"Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!"
[OTH],"Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show. Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready. Now, here's a little Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier took naked pictures of him. Look what happens. Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw! Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!"
[OTH],"Yes, Scoutmaster!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's all the time we have for tonight, Scouts. We sure had a great time, didn't we?"
[OTH],Yes sir Scoutmaster!
[OTH],"Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape."
[OTH],Yeah. Now they're acting like men.
[OTH],"Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside."
[OTH],You bet.
[OTH],I heard that.
[OTH],"See ya, Mr. Grazier."
[OTH],Go away! I'm dead!
[OTH],"Oh, well, here he is."
[OTH],"Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!"
Cartman,Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
[OTH],"I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts."
[OTH],Kicked out? Oh no!
Cartman,But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
[OTH],Really? wull-why?
[OTH],We can't tell you.
[OTH],Why not?
[OTH],"Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no!"
[OTH],"Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week."
[OTH],"Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals."
[OTH],"Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much."
[OTH],What do we want?
[OTH],Gays in Scouts!
[OTH],When do we want it?
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],What do we want?
[OTH],Gays in Scouts!
[OTH],When do we want it?
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],What do we want?
[OTH],"Oh, no."
[OTH],Gays in Scouts!
[OTH],When do we want it?
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],What do we want?
[OTH],Gays in Scouts!
[OTH],When do we want it?
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures."
[OTH],Puppies. Puppies for sale.
Cartman,"Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do!"
[OTH],"Alright, let's set up. Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays? Uh, hello, gays in Scouts? Goddamnit!"
[OTH],"Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?"
[OTH],"That's a great idea! Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!"
[OTH],"Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim. Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!"
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],"Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!"
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],Put on the hat!
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],Pu-put it on!!
[OTH],"Dude, this looks like it could get ugly."
[OTH],Timmih. Timmih.
[OTH],Not this year.
[OTH],"Timmih, Timmih."
Cartman,Cripple fight!
[OTH],Haaa.
[OTH],Come on. Come on!
[OTH],Timmih.
Cartman,Cripple fight!
Cartman,"Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside!"
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],Uh.
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, dude!"
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon."
[OTH],Hahnah Timmih.
[OTH],Huah!
[OTH],Hahnah Timmih.
[OTH],Come on!
[OTH],Timmih!
[OTH],No! Ow!
[OTH],Timmy? Timmy? I told you to put on the HAT!! You dirty motherfucker!
[OTH],What's goin' on?
[OTH],Some kind of gay pride rally.
[OTH],Lah-livin' a lie!
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice."
[OTH],Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.
[OTH],This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
[OTH],"Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off."
[OTH],"The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as Always and 1941."
[OTH],I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!
[OTH],"The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred."
[OTH],"It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate. I am taking this case on, personally!"
[OTH],"With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you."
[OTH],"Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist. This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now."
[OTH],Here's one. And here's another.
[OTH],Kenny?
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],"Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here."
[OTH],"Alright, boys, break it up."
[OTH],All rise.
[OTH],"In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!"
[OTH],Alright! Yeah! Woohoo!
[OTH],"Well, we've all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too."
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!"
[OTH],"Hooray, yeah, yeah!"
[OTH],We did it! We did it!
[OTH],I did it! I did it! Haha!
[OTH],"Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are. And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al."
[OTH],Thank you all very much. But I don't want this.
[OTH],What's he saying?
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club."
[OTH],"Uh, Hooray!"
[OTH],"Hooray, hey!"
[OTH],"So wait, did we do good?"
[OTH],"Uh yeah, ah I think so."
Cartman,"Eh, we kick ass."
[OTH],"Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream!"
[OTH],You can't do this! You homophobe!
[OTH],"Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts."
[OTH],Timmih.
[OTH],I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts.
[OTH],Tim-mih.
[OTH],"Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih... Timmih Timmih Timmih.
Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih... Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih. 
Ahh!"
[OTH],"Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts!"
[OTH],"Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader. Everything is going to be just fine. No naked pictures."
[OTH],"Uh, Timmih."
[OTH],"Yes, Timmy? Oh dear. Jimmy?"
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts.
[OTH],Out of Scouts?
[OTH],Tim-mih.
[OTH],What? Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
[OTH],"Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay."
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],No! No!
[OTH],Timmay!
[OTH],"Okay, Carol, put the card you picked back into the deck so I can't see ittwah."
[OTH],What's going on?
[OTH],"Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?"
[OTH],"Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd. Was that the card you picked?"
[OTH],"No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts."
[OTH],Four of hearts? Really? Look again.
[OTH],Daa-ah!
[OTH],Oooohhhh!
[OTH],Whoa
[OTH],"That's pretty cool, dude!"
Cartman,Who's this asshole?
[OTH],"He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass."
Cartman,"Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?"
[OTH],"Sir, c- could you come over here? Now, what I want you to do, Mr..."
[OTH],Kern.
[OTH],"Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind."
[OTH],O-kay.
[OTH],"Okay, jus... s think about your card. okay, look at me. Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass."
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],"Go on, reach up your ass."
[OTH],"Uh, I don't feel nothin'."
[OTH],Deeper.
[OTH],Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait...
[OTH],Was that the card you picked?
[OTH],Yes! Oh my God!
[OTH],O-hoho!
[OTH],"Wow, that's cool!"
[OTH],How'd he do that??
[OTH],"Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch. Watch."
[OTH],Whoa!!!
[OTH],No way!
[OTH],Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
[OTH],"Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids,  take a pamphlet."
[OTH],"""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go."
Cartman,"Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!"
[OTH],"Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most?"
[OTH],His a-miracles?
[OTH],"Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader."
Cartman,When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?"
[OTH],I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
[OTH],"...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-"
[OTH],And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
[OTH],"Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you? You're not really happy."
[OTH],I'm not really happy.
[OTH],Your potential hasn't even been reached.
[OTH],My potential hasn't even been reached.
[OTH],"If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?"
Cartman,Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
[OTH],That's right.
Cartman,Cool.
[OTH],"Ike, eat your gefilte fish."
[OTH],No-oo.
[OTH],Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
[OTH],"That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!"
[OTH],"We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four...."
[OTH],"Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this."
[OTH],"So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95."
[OTH],"Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father. Ike, you will eat this!"
[OTH],Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.
[OTH],"I am prepared. Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here."
[OTH],Next?
[OTH],"Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean. Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize!
[OTH],"Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea."
[OTH],"Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle."
[OTH],"No, I'm Stan."
[OTH],You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],I'm Kyle.
Cartman,"Heheh, guess who I am, you guys?"
[OTH],"Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here."
[OTH],What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
[OTH],"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home."
[OTH],But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow.
[OTH],I don't care! I'm leaving! 'Scuse me.
[OTH],Where are you going?
[OTH],I'm going home.
[OTH],You don't want to go home.
[OTH],You said we're free to leave whenever we want
[OTH],You are.
[OTH],Move out of the way.
[OTH],I'm not in the way. You are. Are you unhappy with the Church's teachings? Let's just talk about it
[OTH],"I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave."
[OTH],"Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave."
[OTH],"That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay."
[OTH],That's great news.
[OTH],"Okay, it's all clear."
[OTH],What are we doing?
[OTH],We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
[OTH],"Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere."
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!"
[OTH],"It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something."
[OTH],A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
[OTH],Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
[OTH],"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!"
[OTH],I'm not going anywhere!
[OTH],"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!"
[OTH],Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
[OTH],"Oh wait, who am I again?"
[OTH],You're Stan.
[OTH],"Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second. Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!"
[OTH],Then I guess... I'm a dumbass.
[OTH],"Kyle, please. You- You're my best friend."
[OTH],"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore."
[OTH],"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you."
[OTH],"Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic."
Cartman,"Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew."
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],So you're not a cult?
Cartman,"Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you."
[OTH],"Well, alright, come on in."
Cartman,Cool.
[OTH],"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square."
Cartman,"Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?"
[OTH],"No, not really."
Cartman,"Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often."
[OTH],David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night. We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
Cartman,He's going to eat his own head.
[OTH],How many tickets can we put you down for?
[OTH],"Oh, I can't go."
Cartman,"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person."
[OTH],I am happy.
Cartman,No you're not.
[OTH],Yes I am.
Cartman,No you're not.
[OTH],I really am.
Cartman,No you're not.
[OTH],But I am.
Cartman,No you're not.
[OTH],"Alright, two tickets"
[OTH],Great!
[OTH],That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
Cartman,"Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize."
[OTH],"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a-"
Cartman,"Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him."
[OTH],HaaAAAA!
[OTH],"You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner!"
[OTH],"Hi, Jesus. It's me."
[OTH],Stan Marsh.
[OTH],"Of course. I know you, my child. Come in."
[OTH],This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
[OTH],"You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing."
[OTH],"I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special."
[OTH],The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.
[OTH],Can you do it again?
[OTH],"Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around. Er, nuh, tur- turn around. Uh, okay now, turn back. It is now wine!"
[OTH],That's it? That's how you did that trick?
[OTH],"Wuh well, yeah."
[OTH],"That trick sucks, Jesus."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago."
[OTH],"Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out."
[OTH],Then let's go.
[OTH],"But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick."
[OTH],"Oh,don't worry I have a few more miracles up my sleeve."
[OTH],This is a really good turnout.
[OTH],"And now, ladies and gentlemen, David Blaine."
[OTH],"Hello, my children."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, may we have silence, please, as magician David Blaine will now eat... his... own... head."
[OTH],"Dude, no way!"
[OTH],"Thank you, everyone. Our organization grows larger every day. Soon, the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion."
[OTH],Hold!
[OTH],It's Jesus!
Cartman,What's he doin' here?
[OTH],"My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle! Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around Ya need tuh- turn around. Okay, now turn back."
Cartman,Now how the hell did he do that?
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! Twah. Just like you are."
[OTH],"Oh, really. Then what's this Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?"
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],Jesus Christ!
[OTH],He's incredible!
[OTH],"The old religions have failed you! Twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us?"
[OTH],Yes!!
[OTH],"His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it."
[OTH],Then what are we going to do.
[OTH],"I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends. Buddha. Buddha, come in!"
[OTH],Super best friends?
[OTH],"This is Buddha, Jesus. Go ahead."
[OTH],"Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before."
[OTH],I'll call everyone together. Come as fast as you can.
[OTH],"Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long."
[OTH],To where?
[OTH],"Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes."
[OTH],I am ready.
[OTH],Are you still keeping your eyes closed?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Good. Want some peanuts?
[OTH],"Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist."
[OTH],"Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status!"
[OTH],But... we want tax-exempt status.
[OTH],Yeah. Why is that good news?
[OTH],Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide!
[OTH],Mass suicide?
[OTH],"Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife!"
[OTH],"Hehehe, that sounds good."
[OTH],Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn!
Cartman,"Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!"
[OTH],"Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now. This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right."
[OTH],"Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call!"
[OTH],Who the kid?
[OTH],"Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish."
[OTH],"So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?"
[OTH],"More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice."
[OTH],"We all believe in the power of good over evil. Except for Buddha, of course, who doesn't believe in evil."
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],"Jesus, come look at this. After your distress call, we entered David Blaine in the super best friends' computer."
[OTH],"Many interesting things showed up. He was raised in New York city by a decent family, but a freak washing-machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of the black arts."
[OTH],"That's right, Seamen."
[OTH],Sea Man!
[OTH],Uh that's what I said. Seamen.
[OTH],Stop it!
[OTH],"Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!"
Cartman,"No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh?"
[OTH],It's just me.
Cartman,Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
[OTH],Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad."
Cartman,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either. I haven't even gotten my pubes yet."
[OTH],"I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too."
Cartman,"That co- ugh. That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning."
[OTH],"Okay. Okay, you're right. Oh uh Cartman: thanks. Cartman? What the hell?"
Cartman,I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
[OTH],"What have you done, Cartman?!"
Cartman,"This is for your own good, Brother Kyle."
[OTH],"You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause."
Cartman,"Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit."
[OTH],"Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!"
Cartman,At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
[OTH],"The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together."
[OTH],"Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends..."
[OTH],"Look at that, Jesus. His followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine! It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared."
[OTH],I knew it.
[OTH],Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.
[OTH],Perhaps we should have Moses look at the tape and see what he comes up with.
[OTH],"Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power?"
[OTH],Give me the information.
[OTH],"Wow, the Moses."
[OTH],His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute: I'm picking up movement from Blaintologists from all over the country.
[OTH],The Blaintologists are heading to Washington. But why?
[OTH],Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.
[OTH],Omigod!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll become a real religion."
[OTH],He would become unstoppable
[OTH],"Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, Blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide!"
[OTH],"If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah."
[OTH],"Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around. It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool! However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such."
[OTH],Next!
[OTH],"Meanwhile, at the White House..."
[OTH],"Mr. President, we can't let them all kill themselves!"
[OTH],"Well we can't give them tax-exempt status either, Karl!"
[OTH],He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?
Cartman,"Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die!"
[OTH],"Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!"
Cartman,But it's the only way for us to be happy.
[OTH],"Cartman, no!"
[OTH],Give us what we want or we will continue to die
[OTH],"Not so fast, David Blaine!"
[OTH],Jesus! Not again.
[OTH],"Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends!"
[OTH],Buddha!
[OTH],Mohammad!
[OTH],Joseph Smith!
[OTH],Krishna!
[OTH],Lao Tse!
[OTH],Sea-Man!
[OTH],"The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!"
[OTH],I don't think so. Get them!
[OTH],My ice breath should take care of you.
[OTH],Kyle! Kyle!
[OTH],Sweet Salvation!
[OTH],"Kyle?? Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Kyle? Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],That takes care of them.
[OTH],"Now it's your turn, Blaine!"
[OTH],Perhaps you need to see some real magic.
[OTH],Raaargh!
[OTH],Oh this looks like trouble.
[OTH],"So long, Super Best Fools!"
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],Stan!
[OTH],"Kyle, you can't kill yourself!"
[OTH],I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water!
[OTH],We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad! Great Scott!
Cartman,"Bliegh! Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep ."
[OTH],"It is too powerful, Jesus!"
[OTH],It seems to have no weakness!
[OTH],There has to be a way to destroy it. Jesus to Moses!
[OTH],"Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends League..."
[OTH],"Come in, Moses!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.
[OTH],"...Um... Let me think, um... a giant stone John Wilkes Booth?"
[OTH],"You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!"
[OTH],"Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold!"
[OTH],Form of... a beaver!
[OTH],"I will find sources to concrete. You, get the water to mix it with, Seaman."
[OTH],"Using the wood that Krishna cut down as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold."
[OTH],That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.
[OTH],"Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete."
[OTH],"Sea-Man! Look, Swallow, we should be able to divert the water with that pipe."
[OTH],"And so, Seaman and Swallow get to... get to work"
[OTH],"Kyle, you have to hold your breath! Oh, very funny!"
[OTH],"Lao Tse, bring it to life."
[OTH],"Using his power of Taoism, Lao Tse becomes one with the giant stone John Wilkes Booth."
[OTH],Wagh.
[OTH],It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves!
Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to do it."
[OTH],"Later, at exactly the same location..."
[OTH],"Damn you, Super Best Friends!"
[OTH],"Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!"
[OTH],"Then I guess you win this time, Super Best Fools! But I'll be back!"
[OTH],Goddamnit!
[OTH],It's alright. Everything is as it should be.
[OTH],"Oh, shut up, Buddha!"
[OTH],"Our leader, he... he's leaving us!"
[OTH],"Don't leave us, David Blaine!"
[OTH],"Listen up, everyone! You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all."
[OTH],He's right. He... he's right!
[OTH],Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
[OTH],"Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle."
Cartman,"Oh, that's so sweet you guys. You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh"
[OTH],"Haha, hehahaha."
Cartman,"Ah! Ow, stop it! Ah!"
[OTH],"Well, it looks like everything worked out."
[OTH],"And so, Jesus and his companions leave Washington. But their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the Super Best Friends!"
[OTH],"Okay, Carol, put the card you picked back into the deck so I can't see ittwah."
[OTH],What's going on?
[OTH],"Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?"
[OTH],"Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd. Was that the card you picked?"
[OTH],"No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts."
[OTH],Four of hearts? Really? Look again.
[OTH],Daa-ah!
[OTH],Oooohhhh!
[OTH],Whoa
[OTH],"That's pretty cool, dude!"
Cartman,Who's this asshole?
[OTH],"He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass."
Cartman,"Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?"
[OTH],"Sir, c- could you come over here? Now, what I want you to do, Mr..."
[OTH],Kern.
[OTH],"Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind."
[OTH],O-kay.
[OTH],"Okay, jus... s think about your card. okay, look at me. Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass."
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],"Go on, reach up your ass."
[OTH],"Uh, I don't feel nothin'."
[OTH],Deeper.
[OTH],Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait...
[OTH],Was that the card you picked?
[OTH],Yes! Oh my God!
[OTH],O-hoho!
[OTH],"Wow, that's cool!"
[OTH],How'd he do that??
[OTH],"Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch. Watch."
[OTH],Whoa!!!
[OTH],No way!
[OTH],Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
[OTH],"Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids,  take a pamphlet."
[OTH],"""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go."
Cartman,"Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!"
[OTH],"Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most?"
[OTH],His a-miracles?
[OTH],"Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader."
Cartman,When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?"
[OTH],I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
[OTH],"...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-"
[OTH],And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
[OTH],"Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you? You're not really happy."
[OTH],I'm not really happy.
[OTH],Your potential hasn't even been reached.
[OTH],My potential hasn't even been reached.
[OTH],"If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?"
Cartman,Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
[OTH],That's right.
Cartman,Cool.
[OTH],"Ike, eat your gefilte fish."
[OTH],No-oo.
[OTH],Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
[OTH],"That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!"
[OTH],"We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four...."
[OTH],"Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this."
[OTH],"So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95."
[OTH],"Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father. Ike, you will eat this!"
[OTH],Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.
[OTH],"I am prepared. Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here."
[OTH],Next?
[OTH],"Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean. Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head."
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize!
[OTH],"Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea."
[OTH],"Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle."
[OTH],"No, I'm Stan."
[OTH],You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],I'm Kyle.
Cartman,"Heheh, guess who I am, you guys?"
[OTH],"Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here."
[OTH],What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
[OTH],"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home."
[OTH],But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow.
[OTH],I don't care! I'm leaving! 'Scuse me.
[OTH],Where are you going?
[OTH],I'm going home.
[OTH],You don't want to go home.
[OTH],You said we're free to leave whenever we want
[OTH],You are.
[OTH],Move out of the way.
[OTH],I'm not in the way. You are. Are you unhappy with the Church's teachings? Let's just talk about it
[OTH],"I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave."
[OTH],"Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave."
[OTH],"That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay."
[OTH],That's great news.
[OTH],"Okay, it's all clear."
[OTH],What are we doing?
[OTH],We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
[OTH],"Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere."
[OTH],"Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!"
[OTH],"It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something."
[OTH],A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
[OTH],Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
[OTH],"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!"
[OTH],I'm not going anywhere!
[OTH],"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!"
[OTH],Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
[OTH],"Oh wait, who am I again?"
[OTH],You're Stan.
[OTH],"Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second. Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!"
[OTH],Then I guess... I'm a dumbass.
[OTH],"Kyle, please. You- You're my best friend."
[OTH],"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore."
[OTH],"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you."
[OTH],"Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic."
Cartman,"Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew."
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],So you're not a cult?
Cartman,"Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you."
[OTH],"Well, alright, come on in."
Cartman,Cool.
[OTH],"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square."
Cartman,"Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?"
[OTH],"No, not really."
Cartman,"Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often."
[OTH],David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night. We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
Cartman,He's going to eat his own head.
[OTH],How many tickets can we put you down for?
[OTH],"Oh, I can't go."
Cartman,"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person."
[OTH],I am happy.
Cartman,No you're not.
[OTH],Yes I am.
Cartman,No you're not.
[OTH],I really am.
Cartman,No you're not.
[OTH],But I am.
Cartman,No you're not.
[OTH],"Alright, two tickets"
[OTH],Great!
[OTH],That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
Cartman,"Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize."
[OTH],"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a-"
Cartman,"Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him."
[OTH],HaaAAAA!
[OTH],"You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner!"
[OTH],"Hi, Jesus. It's me."
[OTH],Stan Marsh.
[OTH],"Of course. I know you, my child. Come in."
[OTH],This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
[OTH],"You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing."
[OTH],"I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special."
[OTH],The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.
[OTH],Can you do it again?
[OTH],"Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around. Er, nuh, tur- turn around. Uh, okay now, turn back. It is now wine!"
[OTH],That's it? That's how you did that trick?
[OTH],"Wuh well, yeah."
[OTH],"That trick sucks, Jesus."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago."
[OTH],"Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out."
[OTH],Then let's go.
[OTH],"But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick."
[OTH],"Oh,don't worry I have a few more miracles up my sleeve."
[OTH],This is a really good turnout.
[OTH],"And now, ladies and gentlemen, David Blaine."
[OTH],"Hello, my children."
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, may we have silence, please, as magician David Blaine will now eat... his... own... head."
[OTH],"Dude, no way!"
[OTH],"Thank you, everyone. Our organization grows larger every day. Soon, the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion."
[OTH],Hold!
[OTH],It's Jesus!
Cartman,What's he doin' here?
[OTH],"My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle! Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around Ya need tuh- turn around. Okay, now turn back."
Cartman,Now how the hell did he do that?
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],"Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! Twah. Just like you are."
[OTH],"Oh, really. Then what's this Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?"
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],Jesus Christ!
[OTH],He's incredible!
[OTH],"The old religions have failed you! Twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us?"
[OTH],Yes!!
[OTH],"His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it."
[OTH],Then what are we going to do.
[OTH],"I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends. Buddha. Buddha, come in!"
[OTH],Super best friends?
[OTH],"This is Buddha, Jesus. Go ahead."
[OTH],"Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before."
[OTH],I'll call everyone together. Come as fast as you can.
[OTH],"Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long."
[OTH],To where?
[OTH],"Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes."
[OTH],I am ready.
[OTH],Are you still keeping your eyes closed?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Good. Want some peanuts?
[OTH],"Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist."
[OTH],"Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status!"
[OTH],But... we want tax-exempt status.
[OTH],Yeah. Why is that good news?
[OTH],Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide!
[OTH],Mass suicide?
[OTH],"Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife!"
[OTH],"Hehehe, that sounds good."
[OTH],Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn!
Cartman,"Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!"
[OTH],"Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now. This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right."
[OTH],"Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call!"
[OTH],Who the kid?
[OTH],"Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish."
[OTH],"So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?"
[OTH],"More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice."
[OTH],"We all believe in the power of good over evil. Except for Buddha, of course, who doesn't believe in evil."
[OTH],Wow.
[OTH],"Jesus, come look at this. After your distress call, we entered David Blaine in the super best friends' computer."
[OTH],"Many interesting things showed up. He was raised in New York city by a decent family, but a freak washing-machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of the black arts."
[OTH],"That's right, Seamen."
[OTH],Sea Man!
[OTH],Uh that's what I said. Seamen.
[OTH],Stop it!
[OTH],"Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!"
Cartman,"No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh?"
[OTH],It's just me.
Cartman,Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
[OTH],Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad."
Cartman,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either. I haven't even gotten my pubes yet."
[OTH],"I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too."
Cartman,"That co- ugh. That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning."
[OTH],"Okay. Okay, you're right. Oh uh Cartman: thanks. Cartman? What the hell?"
Cartman,I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
[OTH],"What have you done, Cartman?!"
Cartman,"This is for your own good, Brother Kyle."
[OTH],"You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause."
Cartman,"Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit."
[OTH],"Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!"
Cartman,At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
[OTH],"The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together."
[OTH],"Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends..."
[OTH],"Look at that, Jesus. His followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine! It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared."
[OTH],I knew it.
[OTH],Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.
[OTH],Perhaps we should have Moses look at the tape and see what he comes up with.
[OTH],"Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power?"
[OTH],Give me the information.
[OTH],"Wow, the Moses."
[OTH],His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute: I'm picking up movement from Blaintologists from all over the country.
[OTH],The Blaintologists are heading to Washington. But why?
[OTH],Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.
[OTH],Omigod!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll become a real religion."
[OTH],He would become unstoppable
[OTH],"Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, Blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide!"
[OTH],"If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah."
[OTH],"Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around. It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool! However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such."
[OTH],Next!
[OTH],"Meanwhile, at the White House..."
[OTH],"Mr. President, we can't let them all kill themselves!"
[OTH],"Well we can't give them tax-exempt status either, Karl!"
[OTH],He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?
Cartman,"Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die!"
[OTH],"Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!"
Cartman,But it's the only way for us to be happy.
[OTH],"Cartman, no!"
[OTH],Give us what we want or we will continue to die
[OTH],"Not so fast, David Blaine!"
[OTH],Jesus! Not again.
[OTH],"Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends!"
[OTH],Buddha!
[OTH],Mohammad!
[OTH],Joseph Smith!
[OTH],Krishna!
[OTH],Lao Tse!
[OTH],Sea-Man!
[OTH],"The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!"
[OTH],I don't think so. Get them!
[OTH],My ice breath should take care of you.
[OTH],Kyle! Kyle!
[OTH],Sweet Salvation!
[OTH],"Kyle?? Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Kyle? Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
[OTH],That takes care of them.
[OTH],"Now it's your turn, Blaine!"
[OTH],Perhaps you need to see some real magic.
[OTH],Raaargh!
[OTH],Oh this looks like trouble.
[OTH],"So long, Super Best Fools!"
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],Stan!
[OTH],"Kyle, you can't kill yourself!"
[OTH],I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water!
[OTH],We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad! Great Scott!
Cartman,"Bliegh! Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep ."
[OTH],"It is too powerful, Jesus!"
[OTH],It seems to have no weakness!
[OTH],There has to be a way to destroy it. Jesus to Moses!
[OTH],"Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends League..."
[OTH],"Come in, Moses!"
[OTH],What?
[OTH],We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.
[OTH],"...Um... Let me think, um... a giant stone John Wilkes Booth?"
[OTH],"You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!"
[OTH],"Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold!"
[OTH],Form of... a beaver!
[OTH],"I will find sources to concrete. You, get the water to mix it with, Seaman."
[OTH],"Using the wood that Krishna cut down as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold."
[OTH],That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.
[OTH],"Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete."
[OTH],"Sea-Man! Look, Swallow, we should be able to divert the water with that pipe."
[OTH],"And so, Seaman and Swallow get to... get to work"
[OTH],"Kyle, you have to hold your breath! Oh, very funny!"
[OTH],"Lao Tse, bring it to life."
[OTH],"Using his power of Taoism, Lao Tse becomes one with the giant stone John Wilkes Booth."
[OTH],Wagh.
[OTH],It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves!
Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to do it."
[OTH],"Later, at exactly the same location..."
[OTH],"Damn you, Super Best Friends!"
[OTH],"Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!"
[OTH],"Then I guess you win this time, Super Best Fools! But I'll be back!"
[OTH],Goddamnit!
[OTH],It's alright. Everything is as it should be.
[OTH],"Oh, shut up, Buddha!"
[OTH],"Our leader, he... he's leaving us!"
[OTH],"Don't leave us, David Blaine!"
[OTH],"Listen up, everyone! You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all."
[OTH],He's right. He... he's right!
[OTH],Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
[OTH],"Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle."
Cartman,"Oh, that's so sweet you guys. You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh"
[OTH],"Haha, hehahaha."
Cartman,"Ah! Ow, stop it! Ah!"
[OTH],"Well, it looks like everything worked out."
[OTH],"And so, Jesus and his companions leave Washington. But their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the Super Best Friends!"
Cartman,"Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?"
[OTH],"What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?"
Cartman,"Oh, nothing. No big deal, really."
[OTH],What's no big deal?
Cartman,"Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all."
[OTH],...What the hell are you talking about?
Cartman,"Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee!"
[OTH],(You got pubes??)
[OTH],"What's ""pubes""?"
[OTH],Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
[OTH],Oh. No you didn't!
Cartman,Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
[OTH],He's lying.
Cartman,You wanna see 'em?
[OTH],Hell no!
Cartman,"Here, check 'em out."
[OTH],"We don't wanna see them, Cartman!"
Cartman,"There, see? How do you like them apples! HA!"
[OTH],"Uh, what are those?"
Cartman,My pubes.
[OTH],What??
Cartman,I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
[OTH],Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
Cartman,Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha!
[OTH],"Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable."
Cartman,"Don't be jealous, guys. This doesn't mean we can't still hang out. It just means that I matured faster than you. You'll get your pubes guys, someday."
[OTH],"Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!"
Cartman,Uh oo what?
[OTH],"When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!"
Cartman,Nuh uh!
[OTH],Yuh huh!
Cartman,But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
[OTH],"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!"
Cartman,You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
[OTH],"And so I told him, I said ""Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks."" And this stupid asshole buys them!"
[OTH],Oh man!
[OTH],Speak of the devil! What do you want?
Cartman,"Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?"
[OTH],"Uh uh, I don't take returns!"
Cartman,"Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!"
[OTH],"You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!"
Cartman,Just give me back my money...
[OTH],"Buyer beware, dude!"
Cartman,"Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!"
[OTH],"Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in!"
Cartman,"Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes."
[OTH],You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
Cartman,"Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you..."
[OTH],Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
Cartman,"You will? Oh, cool!"
[OTH],"How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?"
Cartman,"Oh. Uh, lessee. I only got six dollars and twelve cents."
[OTH],Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars. And then I'll... give you the twenty.
Cartman,...Okay.
[OTH],"Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars."
Cartman,Right.
[OTH],"Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back."
Cartman,Cool.
[OTH],"And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes."
Cartman,"Sweet! Uh. Oh, goddamnit!"
Cartman,"That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!"
[OTH],"Cartman, can I give you some advice?"
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you."
Cartman,"He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!!"
[OTH],One please.
[OTH],One please.
[OTH],(One please.)
Cartman,One please.
[OTH],That'll be six dollars.
Cartman,"O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?"
[OTH],We don't take pubes!
Cartman,"Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes."
[OTH],We don't take pubes!! End of story!!
Cartman,Racist!
Cartman,"Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!"
[OTH],"Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!"
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
Cartman,Wha-? Uh oo why do you want then back so much?
[OTH],No reason.
Cartman,I don't believe you.
[OTH],Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
Cartman,Pube fair?
[OTH],"They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!"
Cartman,Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
[OTH],"Hehere, take your money!"
Cartman,"Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!"
[OTH],"Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!"
Cartman,"Haha, charade you are, Scott!"
[OTH],Have you no heart??
Cartman,"Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha!"
Cartman,Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
Cartman,"Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir."
[OTH],Yes?
Cartman,Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
[OTH],The pube fair?
Cartman,"Yeah, I have some pubes to sell."
[OTH],"There's no such thing, you little smartass!"
Cartman,No- no such thing?
[OTH],"Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric Cart-man, would you?"
Cartman,I'm Eric Cartman.
[OTH],"Well, I think this is for you."
Cartman,Aaah!!!
Cartman,"A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here"
[OTH],You really went? What a 'tard.
Cartman,"Alright, Scott, you win. I give up."
[OTH],"You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought."
Cartman,"Yeah, I'll see you around. Sure is too bad about my grandma, though..."
[OTH],Your grandma?
Cartman,"Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down."
[OTH],"Oh. Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that."
Cartman,Yeah. Poor grandma...
[OTH],"Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money."
Cartman,"Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh."
[OTH],Here you go.
Cartman,"Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott!"
[OTH],But... just one thing before I give it to you:
Cartman,What?
[OTH],I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
Cartman,Why??
[OTH],Do you want your grandma to live or not?
Cartman,Please Scott give me my money.
[OTH],"No, no, get down on your knees. Lower your head , and say ""I beg you to give me back my money."""
Cartman,I beg you to give me back my money.
[OTH],"Now say, ""I'm a little piggy""."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Say it!
Cartman,I'm a little piggy.
[OTH],"""Here's my snout."""
Cartman,Here's my snout.
[OTH],"""Oink oink oink."""
Cartman,Oink oink oink.
[OTH],"Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!"
Cartman,"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink. I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!"
[OTH],"You mean this? You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars? My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch."
Cartman,What- What are you doing?? No!... Wh-why?
[OTH],Now you can't bug me for your dumb money!
Cartman,Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
Cartman,"Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming. I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all! Yes, Clyde!"
[OTH],Who's Scott Tenorman?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off."
Cartman,"Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!"
[OTH],Wuh what are you gonna do?
Cartman,"Did you guys see that movie ""Hannibal""? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener. It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!"
[OTH],What's in it for us?
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?"
Cartman,"Oh, right. Why should we care? Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!"" Now who's with me?"
[OTH],Timmay!
Cartman,"Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!"
[OTH],"Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih."
Cartman,"There we go. Come and get it. ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it. Come on, good pony. That's it! Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony! Oh no, pony, he'll like that."
[OTH],Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?
Cartman,"No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know."
Cartman,He said it was okay.
[OTH],"Alright, then. Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?"
Cartman,Because of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
[OTH],"Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there."
Cartman,"Not like that, pony!"
[OTH],"Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter."
Cartman,Whattayou mean?
[OTH],Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
Cartman,How do I do that?
[OTH],What do you see?
Cartman,I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
[OTH],"No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill."
Cartman,"Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!"
[OTH],"Ooh, what's a Radiohead?"
Cartman,"You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo..."
[OTH],"Mmuh, what am I doing here?"
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!"
Cartman,"So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a li'l ol' scheme that involves them."
[OTH],"Nice thinking, young hunter."
Cartman,Whoa!
[OTH],What?
Cartman,I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
[OTH],"What?! Give me those! Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!"
[OTH],Mn let me see.
Cartman,"Radiohead. Yes, of course."
[OTH],"Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!"
[OTH],Let me see. Let me see.
[OTH],"Here you go. Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?"
[OTH],Kinda.
[OTH],"Well, stop it!"
[OTH],"Hey, what the hell are you doing out there?"
[OTH],Oh crap!
[OTH],Who's out there?
[OTH],"Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!"
[OTH],I can't.
[OTH],Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police!
[OTH],"Whoa, I gotta get out of here!"
Cartman,"Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?"
[OTH],Uh huh.
Cartman,"Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. Everyone's gonna be there!"
[OTH],"Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me."
Cartman,"You're welcome, Scott."
Cartman,"Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we?"
[OTH],"Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now. Guys, when is the next album coming out?"
Cartman,"That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid. Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too. I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?"
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?"
[OTH],And will there be a new tour?
Cartman,"Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to. Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!"
Cartman,"Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! What a retard! And now everyone saw it!"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy!"
Cartman,"'""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""'"
[OTH],"Oh my God, he killed Kenny."
Cartman,That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
Cartman,"Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!! Then... that... Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!!"
[OTH],"Okay, Cartman, what do you want?"
Cartman,"Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!"
[OTH],Got what all figured out?
Cartman,How to get Scott Tenorman back!
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus!"
Cartman,"I just finished planning a brilliant li'l scheme that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars."
[OTH],"Okay, so what's the plan?"
Cartman,"It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?"
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony!"
[OTH],...What?
Cartman,"Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!!"
[OTH],"You're such a dumbass, Cartman."
Cartman,"...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! Ready, pony? Bite it! Yes!!"
[OTH],"Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do."
[OTH],"Just a second, fellas. Listen to this:
Dear Radiohead, My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday around 5."
[OTH],"Wow, we have to go."
[OTH],To Colorado? But we have an album to mix.
[OTH],Didn't you hear the letter?? This poor kid has cancer! In his ass!
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],Scott Tenorman?
[OTH],What do you want?
[OTH],"We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is going' to try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch."
[OTH],How do you know?
[OTH],"'Cause, we're his friends."
[OTH],Then why are you telling me?
[OTH],'Cause we hate him.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya."
[OTH],See ya.
Cartman,"Hello, Scott!"
[OTH],Hey.
Cartman,"I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides. Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!"
[OTH],"Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great."
Cartman,"Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!"
[OTH],"Wow, a pony ride. Neat."
Cartman,"Oh, it will be very neat, Scott."
[OTH],"Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?"
Cartman,"A little penis-biting, perhaps?"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?"
[OTH],How can I turn it down?
Cartman,"Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good."
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned."
[OTH],Oh dear.
[OTH],"Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do."
[OTH],"Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter."
[OTH],We sure can.
[OTH],"Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now."
[OTH],"Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you."
[OTH],"I'm proud of you, too, Mom."
[OTH],"Let's go, hon."
[OTH],Let's.
[OTH],"What are you doing, Scott?"
[OTH],What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
[OTH],We got everyone we could find to chip in. There are pubes from just about every single kid in town.
[OTH],Awesome!
[OTH],"Oh, dude!"
[OTH],The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!"
[OTH],"This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman."
Cartman,"Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!"
[OTH],"Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this."
Cartman,What's so funny?
[OTH],"Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?"
Cartman,"Not yet, but they will be."
[OTH],"Yeah, sure."
[OTH],"Hello, Eric!"
Cartman,"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],I made some chili to enter into the contest.
Cartman,What contest?
[OTH],"This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?"
Cartman,"Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here."
[OTH],It's my special recipe.
Cartman,"Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming!"
[OTH],"Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything."
Cartman,"Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!"
[OTH],Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
Cartman,"Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive."
[OTH],Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
Cartman,"Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first. Goddamnit!"
[OTH],"Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?"
Cartman,"Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine."
[OTH],"Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it."
Cartman,"Alright. Hey, this is great!"
[OTH],"Eh, it's a special recipe."
Cartman,"Gawh, this is really good, Scott!"
[OTH],"I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you."
Cartman,What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili?
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,"Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents."
[OTH],"Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights."
[OTH],My... mom and dad are... dead?
Cartman,"I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."""
[OTH],Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Cartman,Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah!
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, dude!"
[OTH],My mom and dad are dead! No! NOOO!!
[OTH],"Uhm, excuse me?"
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"We're that band, Radiohead."
[OTH],Jesus!
[OTH],"Jeez, what a li'l crybaby!"
[OTH],"Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??"
[OTH],"You know, everyone has problems; it doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it."
[OTH],"Come on, guys, let's go. This kid is totally not cool."
[OTH],"Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've ever met."
[OTH],Little crybaby!
[OTH],"No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!! Noooo!"
Cartman,"Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott! Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet."
[OTH],"Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again."
[OTH],Good call.
Cartman,"Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy. Mm-yummy you guys! Yuppitibut, that's all, folks!"
Cartman,"Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?"
[OTH],"What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?"
Cartman,"Oh, nothing. No big deal, really."
[OTH],What's no big deal?
Cartman,"Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all."
[OTH],...What the hell are you talking about?
Cartman,"Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee!"
[OTH],(You got pubes??)
[OTH],"What's ""pubes""?"
[OTH],Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
[OTH],Oh. No you didn't!
Cartman,Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
[OTH],He's lying.
Cartman,You wanna see 'em?
[OTH],Hell no!
Cartman,"Here, check 'em out."
[OTH],"We don't wanna see them, Cartman!"
Cartman,"There, see? How do you like them apples! HA!"
[OTH],"Uh, what are those?"
Cartman,My pubes.
[OTH],What??
Cartman,I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
[OTH],Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
Cartman,Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha!
[OTH],"Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable."
Cartman,"Don't be jealous, guys. This doesn't mean we can't still hang out. It just means that I matured faster than you. You'll get your pubes guys, someday."
[OTH],"Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!"
Cartman,Uh oo what?
[OTH],"When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!"
Cartman,Nuh uh!
[OTH],Yuh huh!
Cartman,But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
[OTH],"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!"
Cartman,You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
[OTH],"And so I told him, I said ""Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks."" And this stupid asshole buys them!"
[OTH],Oh man!
[OTH],Speak of the devil! What do you want?
Cartman,"Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?"
[OTH],"Uh uh, I don't take returns!"
Cartman,"Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!"
[OTH],"You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!"
Cartman,Just give me back my money...
[OTH],"Buyer beware, dude!"
Cartman,"Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!"
[OTH],"Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in!"
Cartman,"Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes."
[OTH],You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
Cartman,"Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you..."
[OTH],Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
Cartman,"You will? Oh, cool!"
[OTH],"How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?"
Cartman,"Oh. Uh, lessee. I only got six dollars and twelve cents."
[OTH],Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars. And then I'll... give you the twenty.
Cartman,...Okay.
[OTH],"Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars."
Cartman,Right.
[OTH],"Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back."
Cartman,Cool.
[OTH],"And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes."
Cartman,"Sweet! Uh. Oh, goddamnit!"
Cartman,"That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!"
[OTH],"Cartman, can I give you some advice?"
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you."
Cartman,"He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!!"
[OTH],One please.
[OTH],One please.
[OTH],(One please.)
Cartman,One please.
[OTH],That'll be six dollars.
Cartman,"O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?"
[OTH],We don't take pubes!
Cartman,"Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes."
[OTH],We don't take pubes!! End of story!!
Cartman,Racist!
Cartman,"Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!"
[OTH],"Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!"
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
Cartman,Wha-? Uh oo why do you want then back so much?
[OTH],No reason.
Cartman,I don't believe you.
[OTH],Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
Cartman,Pube fair?
[OTH],"They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!"
Cartman,Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
[OTH],"Hehere, take your money!"
Cartman,"Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!"
[OTH],"Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!"
Cartman,"Haha, charade you are, Scott!"
[OTH],Have you no heart??
Cartman,"Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha!"
Cartman,Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
Cartman,"Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir."
[OTH],Yes?
Cartman,Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
[OTH],The pube fair?
Cartman,"Yeah, I have some pubes to sell."
[OTH],"There's no such thing, you little smartass!"
Cartman,No- no such thing?
[OTH],"Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric Cart-man, would you?"
Cartman,I'm Eric Cartman.
[OTH],"Well, I think this is for you."
Cartman,Aaah!!!
Cartman,"A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here"
[OTH],You really went? What a 'tard.
Cartman,"Alright, Scott, you win. I give up."
[OTH],"You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought."
Cartman,"Yeah, I'll see you around. Sure is too bad about my grandma, though..."
[OTH],Your grandma?
Cartman,"Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down."
[OTH],"Oh. Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that."
Cartman,Yeah. Poor grandma...
[OTH],"Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money."
Cartman,"Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh."
[OTH],Here you go.
Cartman,"Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott!"
[OTH],But... just one thing before I give it to you:
Cartman,What?
[OTH],I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
Cartman,Huh?
[OTH],Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
Cartman,Why??
[OTH],Do you want your grandma to live or not?
Cartman,Please Scott give me my money.
[OTH],"No, no, get down on your knees. Lower your head , and say ""I beg you to give me back my money."""
Cartman,I beg you to give me back my money.
[OTH],"Now say, ""I'm a little piggy""."
Cartman,What?
[OTH],Say it!
Cartman,I'm a little piggy.
[OTH],"""Here's my snout."""
Cartman,Here's my snout.
[OTH],"""Oink oink oink."""
Cartman,Oink oink oink.
[OTH],"Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!"
Cartman,"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink. I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!"
[OTH],"You mean this? You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars? My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch."
Cartman,What- What are you doing?? No!... Wh-why?
[OTH],Now you can't bug me for your dumb money!
Cartman,Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
Cartman,"Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming. I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all! Yes, Clyde!"
[OTH],Who's Scott Tenorman?
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],"Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off."
Cartman,"Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!"
[OTH],Wuh what are you gonna do?
Cartman,"Did you guys see that movie ""Hannibal""? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener. It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!"
[OTH],What's in it for us?
Cartman,What?
[OTH],"Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?"
Cartman,"Oh, right. Why should we care? Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!"" Now who's with me?"
[OTH],Timmay!
Cartman,"Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!"
[OTH],"Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih."
Cartman,"There we go. Come and get it. ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it. Come on, good pony. That's it! Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony! Oh no, pony, he'll like that."
[OTH],Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?
Cartman,"No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off."
[OTH],"Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know."
Cartman,He said it was okay.
[OTH],"Alright, then. Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?"
Cartman,Because of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
[OTH],"Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there."
Cartman,"Not like that, pony!"
[OTH],"Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter."
Cartman,Whattayou mean?
[OTH],Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
Cartman,How do I do that?
[OTH],What do you see?
Cartman,I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
[OTH],"No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill."
Cartman,"Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!"
[OTH],"Ooh, what's a Radiohead?"
Cartman,"You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo..."
[OTH],"Mmuh, what am I doing here?"
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!"
Cartman,"So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a li'l ol' scheme that involves them."
[OTH],"Nice thinking, young hunter."
Cartman,Whoa!
[OTH],What?
Cartman,I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
[OTH],"What?! Give me those! Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!"
[OTH],Mn let me see.
Cartman,"Radiohead. Yes, of course."
[OTH],"Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!"
[OTH],Let me see. Let me see.
[OTH],"Here you go. Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?"
[OTH],Kinda.
[OTH],"Well, stop it!"
[OTH],"Hey, what the hell are you doing out there?"
[OTH],Oh crap!
[OTH],Who's out there?
[OTH],"Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!"
[OTH],I can't.
[OTH],Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police!
[OTH],"Whoa, I gotta get out of here!"
Cartman,"Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?"
[OTH],Uh huh.
Cartman,"Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. Everyone's gonna be there!"
[OTH],"Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me."
Cartman,"You're welcome, Scott."
Cartman,"Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we?"
[OTH],"Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now. Guys, when is the next album coming out?"
Cartman,"That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid. Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too. I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?"
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?"
[OTH],And will there be a new tour?
Cartman,"Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to. Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!"
Cartman,"Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! What a retard! And now everyone saw it!"
[OTH],"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy!"
Cartman,"'""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""'"
[OTH],"Oh my God, he killed Kenny."
Cartman,That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
Cartman,"Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!! Then... that... Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!!"
[OTH],"Okay, Cartman, what do you want?"
Cartman,"Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!"
[OTH],Got what all figured out?
Cartman,How to get Scott Tenorman back!
[OTH],"Oh, Jesus!"
Cartman,"I just finished planning a brilliant li'l scheme that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars."
[OTH],"Okay, so what's the plan?"
Cartman,"It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?"
[OTH],Yeah.
Cartman,"So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony!"
[OTH],...What?
Cartman,"Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!!"
[OTH],"You're such a dumbass, Cartman."
Cartman,"...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! Ready, pony? Bite it! Yes!!"
[OTH],"Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do."
[OTH],"Just a second, fellas. Listen to this:
Dear Radiohead, My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday around 5."
[OTH],"Wow, we have to go."
[OTH],To Colorado? But we have an album to mix.
[OTH],Didn't you hear the letter?? This poor kid has cancer! In his ass!
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],Scott Tenorman?
[OTH],What do you want?
[OTH],"We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is going' to try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch."
[OTH],How do you know?
[OTH],"'Cause, we're his friends."
[OTH],Then why are you telling me?
[OTH],'Cause we hate him.
[OTH],Oh.
[OTH],"Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya."
[OTH],See ya.
Cartman,"Hello, Scott!"
[OTH],Hey.
Cartman,"I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides. Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!"
[OTH],"Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great."
Cartman,"Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!"
[OTH],"Wow, a pony ride. Neat."
Cartman,"Oh, it will be very neat, Scott."
[OTH],"Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?"
Cartman,"A little penis-biting, perhaps?"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?"
[OTH],How can I turn it down?
Cartman,"Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good."
[OTH],"Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned."
[OTH],Oh dear.
[OTH],"Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do."
[OTH],"Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter."
[OTH],We sure can.
[OTH],"Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now."
[OTH],"Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you."
[OTH],"I'm proud of you, too, Mom."
[OTH],"Let's go, hon."
[OTH],Let's.
[OTH],"What are you doing, Scott?"
[OTH],What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
[OTH],We got everyone we could find to chip in. There are pubes from just about every single kid in town.
[OTH],Awesome!
[OTH],"Oh, dude!"
[OTH],The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
[OTH],Yeah!
Cartman,"Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!"
[OTH],"This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman."
Cartman,"Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!"
[OTH],"Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this."
Cartman,What's so funny?
[OTH],"Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?"
Cartman,"Not yet, but they will be."
[OTH],"Yeah, sure."
[OTH],"Hello, Eric!"
Cartman,"Hey, Chef."
[OTH],I made some chili to enter into the contest.
Cartman,What contest?
[OTH],"This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?"
Cartman,"Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here."
[OTH],It's my special recipe.
Cartman,"Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming!"
[OTH],"Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything."
Cartman,"Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!"
[OTH],Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
Cartman,"Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive."
[OTH],Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
Cartman,"Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first. Goddamnit!"
[OTH],"Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?"
Cartman,"Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine."
[OTH],"Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it."
Cartman,"Alright. Hey, this is great!"
[OTH],"Eh, it's a special recipe."
Cartman,"Gawh, this is really good, Scott!"
[OTH],"I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you."
Cartman,What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili?
[OTH],What?!
Cartman,"Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents."
[OTH],"Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights."
[OTH],My... mom and dad are... dead?
Cartman,"I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."""
[OTH],Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Cartman,Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah!
[OTH],"Jesus Christ, dude!"
[OTH],My mom and dad are dead! No! NOOO!!
[OTH],"Uhm, excuse me?"
[OTH],Who are you?
[OTH],"We're that band, Radiohead."
[OTH],Jesus!
[OTH],"Jeez, what a li'l crybaby!"
[OTH],"Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??"
[OTH],"You know, everyone has problems; it doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it."
[OTH],"Come on, guys, let's go. This kid is totally not cool."
[OTH],"Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've ever met."
[OTH],Little crybaby!
[OTH],"No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!! Noooo!"
Cartman,"Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott! Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet."
[OTH],"Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again."
[OTH],Good call.
Cartman,"Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy. Mm-yummy you guys! Yuppitibut, that's all, folks!"
[OTH],"And so, in her career filled with lies, backstabbing, and whoring herself for money, she learned that the price of fame can be pleasing 65 men at once in a dark, dirty alley. And so ends ""Punky Brewster, Behind The Blow."""
Cartman,"Whoa, bummer, dude."
[OTH],"Okay, dude, it's 3:30."
[OTH],It's time for the Terrance & Phillip Show!
[OTH],Yay!
[OTH],"Excuse me, buddy."
[OTH],"Why, did you fart? Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Oh man, this is another rerun."
Cartman,Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch."
[OTH],I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
[OTH],"Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you get to the auto garage!"
[OTH],Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
[OTH],Sure. You go the same way except stick your finger up your ass.
[OTH],"No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?"
[OTH],OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
[OTH],"Alright, no problem, buddy. Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?"
[OTH],You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
[OTH],Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
[OTH],Because I had an itch up my ass.
[OTH],Because I had an itch up my ass.
[OTH],Terrance & Phillip will be right back...
[OTH],...after these messages.
[OTH],When are they gonna make new ones?
[OTH],"Hey kids, don't miss the greatest event of the year! This Thursday night at the Denver Coliseum, see Terrance and Phillip LIVE! And in person!"
[OTH],What's this?
[OTH],"One night and one night only, see all your favorite Terrance and Phillip bits live!"
[OTH],Oh my God!
Cartman,You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
[OTH],Enough! I know!
[OTH],"To order tickets, call TicketSlave NOW!!"
[OTH],Write the number down! Write the number down!!
[OTH],Dude! Did you get 'em?
[OTH],"I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!"
Cartman,Awesome! Give me mine!
[OTH],"Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?"
[OTH],Yep. Tomorrow night.
[OTH],"Alright, children, let's settle down. As you know, this coming Friday is Earth Day. and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival."
[OTH],Oohh.
[OTH],The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it.
[OTH],"Hello children, I know you're all very excited about having the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival put on in your town."
[OTH],"You care very much about the earth, don't you?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Good, because it's up to all of you to get lots of people to come.and make it look great. The festival is on Friday, so we'll start getting it ready tomorrow night."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],We've all gotta pitch in.
[OTH],"Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night."
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],You... what??
[OTH],Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
[OTH],And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?
Cartman,"Well yeah, dude."
[OTH],You don't care about Terrance and Phillip. Nothing matters more than saving the planet from Republicans. You don't need to see Terrance and Phillip.
[OTH],"No, dude, we really, really do."
[OTH],Their will is strong.
[OTH],"I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day."
[OTH],"Uhuh, but that's why we're going."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival."
[OTH],You can get Terrance and Phillip to perform? That would be great. Terrance and Phillip would draw huge ratings from children all over the country.
[OTH],"Very well, kids; we'll work on getting the event ready here, and you go get Terrance and Phillip."
[OTH],All right!
[OTH],But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.
[OTH],"Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!"
[OTH],Ladies and gentlemen! Put your hands together for... Terrance!
[OTH],"Hellooo, Den-ver!"
[OTH],"Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat."
[OTH],"Yeah, he looks terrible."
[OTH],"How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh. Hey, do you all remember this one? ""Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass."" ""Reallih? Let me take a look."" ""Look closer."""
[OTH],Uuuuhh.
Cartman,Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
Cartman,Phil-lip!
[OTH],Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip!
[OTH],"And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy!"
[OTH],Hello Terrance.
[OTH],Hello Phillip.
[OTH],Phillip? That's not Phillip.
[OTH],"Say, Phillip, I have a question for you."
[OTH],"Ho-okay, shoot."
[OTH],"Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?"
Cartman,I think this new guy's funny.
[OTH],And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62.
[OTH],"Excuse me, sir. Do you know Who farted?"
[OTH],He sure did.
[OTH],What's the person's name?
[OTH],Who.
[OTH],The guy that farted!
[OTH],Who!
[OTH],The person that passed gas!
[OTH],Who passed gas!
[OTH],"Now, why are you asking me?"
[OTH],That's the man's name?
[OTH],That's Who's name?
[OTH],Yes!
[OTH],"Something very terrible has happened in the world of Terrance and Phillip, and we've got to find out what."
[OTH],"Look, buddy, all I'm trying to find out is What's the guy's name that farted?"
[OTH],"Right, the guy that drank his own urine."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],"Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this. 'Scuse us."
[OTH],Where do you think you're going?
[OTH],We have to talk to Terrance.
[OTH],"Hyeah, right."
[OTH],It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
[OTH],"Then get in the ""Official Presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club"" line."
Cartman,"Aw, dude, gay!"
[OTH],You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
[OTH],"You and about a thousand other people at one time or another. Now, get out of my face!"
Cartman,Racist!
[OTH],"Man, this sucks!"
[OTH],"Are you guys official presidents, too?"
Cartman,"Don't talk to us, kid."
[OTH],Hey! Look at that line! It's way shorter.
[OTH],I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
Cartman,Kenny's a random slut.
[OTH],"Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on. Sshh."
[OTH],"Mmm. Mmm, yummy. Mmm."
[OTH],It was so great meeting you. I feel like we really shared something.
[OTH],"We sure did, baby. Next?"
[OTH],Hello Terrance. I'm such a huuuge fan.
[OTH],You're a huge fan alright!
[OTH],Can I just have you sign my breasts?
[OTH],But what do I get in return?
[OTH],Whatever you want.
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Oh, that's good, baby."
[OTH],"Oh, Terrance, I love you."
[OTH],You like that?
[OTH],I love you!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],I LOVE you!
[OTH],Ah good.
[OTH],I LOVE YOU!!
[OTH],Yeah-
[OTH],OH!!!
Cartman,"Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there!"
[OTH],"Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?"
[OTH],What the hell?
[OTH],Oh wow! We had quadruplets!
[OTH],"We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here."
[OTH],"Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids. What do you want, an autograph or something?"
[OTH],"Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform."
[OTH],"Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?"
[OTH],But where's Phillip?
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],"Phillip, your partner."
[OTH],"Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, ""Hey, where's Phillip?"" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK! You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!"
[OTH],But the guy who replaced him sucks!
[OTH],"Ah, I know. I know he sucks To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?"
[OTH],"Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip."
[OTH],"Ogh, whatever. The point is, Phillip and I are through. And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money."
[OTH],What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
[OTH],"HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do ""more serious"" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto."
[OTH],(Toronto?)
[OTH],But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
[OTH],"Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle."
[OTH],"Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work!"
[OTH],"Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming."
[OTH],That's not true. Global warming is going to kill us all. The Republicans are responsible.
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Oh no, dude."
[OTH],"Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule."
[OTH],"Uuuh, we didn't get them."
[OTH],You what?
[OTH],"They're not together anymore, dude."
[OTH],You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.
[OTH],"Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy."
[OTH],"You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else!"
[OTH],But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
[OTH],"Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements. Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives."
[OTH],"Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada."
Cartman,Weak.
[OTH],Ahhh
[OTH],Part them; they are incensed.
[OTH],"Nay, come, again."
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],"Look to the queen there, buddih!"
[OTH],"They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?"
[OTH],"How is't, Laertes?"
[OTH],"Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery."
[OTH],How does the queen?
[OTH],"Hey guy, she swounds to see them bleed, buddih."
[OTH],"No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. Blagh!"
[OTH],O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.
[OTH],"It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame."
[OTH],"The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work, buddih!"
[OTH],Treason! treason!
[OTH],"O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt."
[OTH],"Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother."
[OTH],Blagh!
[OTH],"He is served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Blagh!"
[OTH],"Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you, buddih--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest, guy; report me and my cause aright, to the unsatisfied."
[OTH],"Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih."
[OTH],"Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end?"
[OTH],"...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh."
[OTH],"Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, buddih!..."
[OTH],Phillip! Phillip!
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
[OTH],"Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there."
[OTH],"Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-"
[OTH],AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
[OTH],But we need you!
[OTH],"Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long?"
Cartman,"Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!"
[OTH],"Yeah, whatever, kid."
[OTH],"He'll do it, dude."
[OTH],"Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."""
[OTH],Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
[OTH],Two thousand dollars.
[OTH],"I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details. Gotta run!"
[OTH],"Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there."
[OTH],"I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times."
Cartman,"Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies."
[OTH],Ih-it'll be okay.
[OTH],"Work faster! Faster, children! Earth Day is coming! Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up."
[OTH],They said they'd come.
[OTH],I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
[OTH],Maybe you kids don't understand how important Earth Day is for the future of our planet. Maybe you need some convincing. Carl?
[OTH],(AAAAHH!)
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?"
[OTH],He's here!
[OTH],"Oh. Very good. Mr. Phillip, I am Jack Farliss, head of the Earth Day Committee. Thank you for being part of this important event."
[OTH],Whatever. Where's my check?
[OTH],"Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?"
[OTH],What's HE doing here?
[OTH],"Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it."
[OTH],Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
[OTH],"Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first."
[OTH],"So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!"
[OTH],My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
[OTH],"Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day. You care about Mother Earth, don't you?"
[OTH],"Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!"
[OTH],Ditto!
[OTH],Fine!
[OTH],See? I told you it would work.
[OTH],"Alright, we'll come off the speech about the dying whales, and thennn, action!"
[OTH],"Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass."
[OTH],Really? Let me take a look.
[OTH],Look closer.
[OTH],"Haha, hahahaha. Hahaha."
[OTH],Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
[OTH],"Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole!"
[OTH],"You're right. It's a better one, asshole!"
[OTH],"Just do the bit right, dickface!"
[OTH],"Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!"
[OTH],I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!
[OTH],That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
[OTH],"I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack!"
[OTH],You can't leave! The show starts soon!
[OTH],"Boys, you've got... three hours to get those two back together. Do I need to remind you what will happen if you don't? Carl!"
[OTH],(OOOWWW!)
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Good luck, boys."
Cartman,"We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us."
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Earth Day 2001 is in full force. Environmental awareness games, booths, and of course, the entertainment on stage, which is being broadcast live all over the country. This eco-happy crowd is thrilled and waiting in anticipation for the arrival of Terrance and Phillip, who are promised by these four boys."
[OTH],"What a touching and true song. You know, it's true. Republicans are ruining the earth."
[OTH],Republicans are ruining the earth.
[OTH],"Alright. Well, I think I know why most of you tuned in today. How about some Earth Day entertainment?!"
[OTH],"Hooray for the earth! We must protect it. And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video!"
[OTH],On video?
[OTH],They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada. But a fast-paced rocket ride to success would bring them to the depths of despair. This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow.
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],What the hell do you call this?!
[OTH],"Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month."
[OTH],"We promised people Terrance and Phillip, not a video documentary! You've ruined the earth for the last time, boys!"
[OTH],Aaaahh!
[OTH],"Terrance was born Terrance Henry Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto. At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies. It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle , a brash young baby from Montreal. Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere. At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show . where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time."
[OTH],"And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have two adorable little boys from Canada. Please put your hands together for the music of young Terrance and Phillip."
[OTH],"Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!"
[OTH],"It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian."
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!"
[OTH],"The Canadian act confused American audiences. But then something happened that would change Terrance and Phillip's act forever. It was the birth of Canadian comedy. Terrance and Phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art, and meeting some of America's most influential people."
[OTH],"Excuse me, which way is the bus station?"
[OTH],"Hey, you're the guy on the screen."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"But it was in 1974, on the Sonny & Cher Show, that Terrance and Phillip finally started to mix their Canadian humor with deep political insight."
[OTH],"You know, Cher, a lot of us real Americans don't know much about Canada."
[OTH],"Well, a lot of us real Americans aren't as stupid and short as you, hm."
[OTH],Please put your groovy hands together for the young and talented Terrance and Phillip!
[OTH],"Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war."
[OTH],Here's a missile for ya!
[OTH],That's better.
[OTH],"With this bold mix of humor and political insight, the world couldn't get enough of Terrance and Phillip. But their fame would come at a price, when Behind the Blow continues."
[OTH],"Okay. Okay, I think we lost them."
[OTH],"Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!"
Cartman,"Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!"
[OTH],"I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!"
[OTH],"Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason."
[OTH],There they are!
[OTH],Haaah!
[OTH],(Aahhh!)
[OTH],Go! Run run run!
[OTH],"As they entered their late teens, Terrance and Phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success. But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues. The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip. Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were on the cover of every magazine. And then in 1998, even a Saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip. Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices."
[OTH],"Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?"
[OTH],"I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas."
[OTH],"Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said?"
[OTH],"As leader of the goat people, I have seen my species nearly wiped out by your dangerous gas."
[OTH],"Wow, that sucks."
[OTH],"The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998, the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called ""Not Without My Anus."" It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show, the John Schneider Variety Hour , was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie , they were enraged, bewildered, and scared. The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others. The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish. Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars. It was the first time the duo tasted failure , and it nearly killed them both."
[OTH],What's going on here?
[OTH],"Sh. We're watching ""Behind the Blow,"" m'kay."
[OTH],"Come on, Kenny, hurry up!"
[OTH],"After years of depression and suicide attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally decided to get together for one last film: the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer. And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 , in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was considered a great success. After almost being executed by the American government , Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada , where they were touted as heroes. They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through. And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow."
[OTH],Terrance...
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too."
[OTH],"I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before."
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],We sssure did go through a lot together.
[OTH],We sure did.
[OTH],"Terrance, I-"
[OTH],"No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault."
[OTH],"That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault. But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did."
[OTH],"No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone."
[OTH],Think of all the endangered species that will now vanish because of you! Carl!
[OTH],(AH how!)
[OTH],"So long, boys!"
[OTH],"Wait! dude, LOOK!"
[OTH],"Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you."
[OTH],"That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks"
[OTH],"Ohohoho, nohoho!"
[OTH],They're back!
Cartman,Alright!
[OTH],"Yes! Earth Day is saved, boys! Everything worked out after all!"
[OTH],It sure did.
Cartman,"Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!"
[OTH],"(Oh, well now that's sweet.)"
[OTH],"Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted?"
[OTH],"He sure did, Phillip."
[OTH],"NO, I'm asking you his name!"
[OTH],"And so, Terrance and Phillip got back together, proving once and for all that fame and fortune are never as important as friendship."
[OTH],"And so, in her career filled with lies, backstabbing, and whoring herself for money, she learned that the price of fame can be pleasing 65 men at once in a dark, dirty alley. And so ends ""Punky Brewster, Behind The Blow."""
Cartman,"Whoa, bummer, dude."
[OTH],"Okay, dude, it's 3:30."
[OTH],It's time for the Terrance & Phillip Show!
[OTH],Yay!
[OTH],"Excuse me, buddy."
[OTH],"Why, did you fart? Oh, no!"
[OTH],"Oh man, this is another rerun."
Cartman,Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
[OTH],"Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch."
[OTH],I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
[OTH],"Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you get to the auto garage!"
[OTH],Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
[OTH],Sure. You go the same way except stick your finger up your ass.
[OTH],"No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?"
[OTH],OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
[OTH],"Alright, no problem, buddy. Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?"
[OTH],You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
[OTH],Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
[OTH],Because I had an itch up my ass.
[OTH],Because I had an itch up my ass.
[OTH],Terrance & Phillip will be right back...
[OTH],...after these messages.
[OTH],When are they gonna make new ones?
[OTH],"Hey kids, don't miss the greatest event of the year! This Thursday night at the Denver Coliseum, see Terrance and Phillip LIVE! And in person!"
[OTH],What's this?
[OTH],"One night and one night only, see all your favorite Terrance and Phillip bits live!"
[OTH],Oh my God!
Cartman,You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
[OTH],Enough! I know!
[OTH],"To order tickets, call TicketSlave NOW!!"
[OTH],Write the number down! Write the number down!!
[OTH],Dude! Did you get 'em?
[OTH],"I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!"
Cartman,Awesome! Give me mine!
[OTH],"Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?"
[OTH],Yep. Tomorrow night.
[OTH],"Alright, children, let's settle down. As you know, this coming Friday is Earth Day. and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival."
[OTH],Oohh.
[OTH],The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it.
[OTH],"Hello children, I know you're all very excited about having the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival put on in your town."
[OTH],"You care very much about the earth, don't you?"
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"Good, because it's up to all of you to get lots of people to come.and make it look great. The festival is on Friday, so we'll start getting it ready tomorrow night."
[OTH],What??
[OTH],We've all gotta pitch in.
[OTH],"Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night."
Cartman,Yeah.
[OTH],You... what??
[OTH],Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
[OTH],And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?
Cartman,"Well yeah, dude."
[OTH],You don't care about Terrance and Phillip. Nothing matters more than saving the planet from Republicans. You don't need to see Terrance and Phillip.
[OTH],"No, dude, we really, really do."
[OTH],Their will is strong.
[OTH],"I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day."
[OTH],"Uhuh, but that's why we're going."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival."
[OTH],You can get Terrance and Phillip to perform? That would be great. Terrance and Phillip would draw huge ratings from children all over the country.
[OTH],"Very well, kids; we'll work on getting the event ready here, and you go get Terrance and Phillip."
[OTH],All right!
[OTH],But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.
[OTH],"Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!"
[OTH],Ladies and gentlemen! Put your hands together for... Terrance!
[OTH],"Hellooo, Den-ver!"
[OTH],"Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat."
[OTH],"Yeah, he looks terrible."
[OTH],"How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh. Hey, do you all remember this one? ""Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass."" ""Reallih? Let me take a look."" ""Look closer."""
[OTH],Uuuuhh.
Cartman,Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
Cartman,Phil-lip!
[OTH],Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip!
[OTH],"And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy!"
[OTH],Hello Terrance.
[OTH],Hello Phillip.
[OTH],Phillip? That's not Phillip.
[OTH],"Say, Phillip, I have a question for you."
[OTH],"Ho-okay, shoot."
[OTH],"Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?"
Cartman,I think this new guy's funny.
[OTH],And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62.
[OTH],"Excuse me, sir. Do you know Who farted?"
[OTH],He sure did.
[OTH],What's the person's name?
[OTH],Who.
[OTH],The guy that farted!
[OTH],Who!
[OTH],The person that passed gas!
[OTH],Who passed gas!
[OTH],"Now, why are you asking me?"
[OTH],That's the man's name?
[OTH],That's Who's name?
[OTH],Yes!
[OTH],"Something very terrible has happened in the world of Terrance and Phillip, and we've got to find out what."
[OTH],"Look, buddy, all I'm trying to find out is What's the guy's name that farted?"
[OTH],"Right, the guy that drank his own urine."
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],"Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this. 'Scuse us."
[OTH],Where do you think you're going?
[OTH],We have to talk to Terrance.
[OTH],"Hyeah, right."
[OTH],It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
[OTH],"Then get in the ""Official Presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club"" line."
Cartman,"Aw, dude, gay!"
[OTH],You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
[OTH],"You and about a thousand other people at one time or another. Now, get out of my face!"
Cartman,Racist!
[OTH],"Man, this sucks!"
[OTH],"Are you guys official presidents, too?"
Cartman,"Don't talk to us, kid."
[OTH],Hey! Look at that line! It's way shorter.
[OTH],I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
Cartman,Kenny's a random slut.
[OTH],"Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on. Sshh."
[OTH],"Mmm. Mmm, yummy. Mmm."
[OTH],It was so great meeting you. I feel like we really shared something.
[OTH],"We sure did, baby. Next?"
[OTH],Hello Terrance. I'm such a huuuge fan.
[OTH],You're a huge fan alright!
[OTH],Can I just have you sign my breasts?
[OTH],But what do I get in return?
[OTH],Whatever you want.
[OTH],"Oh yeah. Oh, that's good, baby."
[OTH],"Oh, Terrance, I love you."
[OTH],You like that?
[OTH],I love you!
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],I LOVE you!
[OTH],Ah good.
[OTH],I LOVE YOU!!
[OTH],Yeah-
[OTH],OH!!!
Cartman,"Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there!"
[OTH],"Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?"
[OTH],What the hell?
[OTH],Oh wow! We had quadruplets!
[OTH],"We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here."
[OTH],"Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids. What do you want, an autograph or something?"
[OTH],"Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform."
[OTH],"Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?"
[OTH],But where's Phillip?
[OTH],Who?
[OTH],"Phillip, your partner."
[OTH],"Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, ""Hey, where's Phillip?"" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK! You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!"
[OTH],But the guy who replaced him sucks!
[OTH],"Ah, I know. I know he sucks To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?"
[OTH],"Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip."
[OTH],"Ogh, whatever. The point is, Phillip and I are through. And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money."
[OTH],What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
[OTH],"HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do ""more serious"" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto."
[OTH],(Toronto?)
[OTH],But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
[OTH],"Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle."
[OTH],"Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work!"
[OTH],"Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming."
[OTH],That's not true. Global warming is going to kill us all. The Republicans are responsible.
[OTH],Thank you.
[OTH],"Oh no, dude."
[OTH],"Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule."
[OTH],"Uuuh, we didn't get them."
[OTH],You what?
[OTH],"They're not together anymore, dude."
[OTH],You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.
[OTH],"Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy."
[OTH],"You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else!"
[OTH],But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
[OTH],"Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements. Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives."
[OTH],"Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada."
Cartman,Weak.
[OTH],Ahhh
[OTH],Part them; they are incensed.
[OTH],"Nay, come, again."
[OTH],Aaaah!
[OTH],"Look to the queen there, buddih!"
[OTH],"They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?"
[OTH],"How is't, Laertes?"
[OTH],"Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery."
[OTH],How does the queen?
[OTH],"Hey guy, she swounds to see them bleed, buddih."
[OTH],"No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. Blagh!"
[OTH],O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.
[OTH],"It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame."
[OTH],"The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work, buddih!"
[OTH],Treason! treason!
[OTH],"O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt."
[OTH],"Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother."
[OTH],Blagh!
[OTH],"He is served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Blagh!"
[OTH],"Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you, buddih--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest, guy; report me and my cause aright, to the unsatisfied."
[OTH],"Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih."
[OTH],"Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end?"
[OTH],"...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh."
[OTH],"Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, buddih!..."
[OTH],Phillip! Phillip!
[OTH],Yes?
[OTH],Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
[OTH],"Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there."
[OTH],"Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-"
[OTH],AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
[OTH],But we need you!
[OTH],"Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long?"
Cartman,"Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!"
[OTH],"Yeah, whatever, kid."
[OTH],"He'll do it, dude."
[OTH],"Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."""
[OTH],Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
[OTH],Two thousand dollars.
[OTH],"I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details. Gotta run!"
[OTH],"Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there."
[OTH],"I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times."
Cartman,"Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies."
[OTH],Ih-it'll be okay.
[OTH],"Work faster! Faster, children! Earth Day is coming! Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up."
[OTH],They said they'd come.
[OTH],I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
[OTH],Maybe you kids don't understand how important Earth Day is for the future of our planet. Maybe you need some convincing. Carl?
[OTH],(AAAAHH!)
[OTH],Oh my God!
[OTH],"Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?"
[OTH],He's here!
[OTH],"Oh. Very good. Mr. Phillip, I am Jack Farliss, head of the Earth Day Committee. Thank you for being part of this important event."
[OTH],Whatever. Where's my check?
[OTH],"Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?"
[OTH],What's HE doing here?
[OTH],"Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it."
[OTH],Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
[OTH],"Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first."
[OTH],"So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!"
[OTH],My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
[OTH],"Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day. You care about Mother Earth, don't you?"
[OTH],"Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!"
[OTH],Ditto!
[OTH],Fine!
[OTH],See? I told you it would work.
[OTH],"Alright, we'll come off the speech about the dying whales, and thennn, action!"
[OTH],"Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass."
[OTH],Really? Let me take a look.
[OTH],Look closer.
[OTH],"Haha, hahahaha. Hahaha."
[OTH],Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
[OTH],"Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole!"
[OTH],"You're right. It's a better one, asshole!"
[OTH],"Just do the bit right, dickface!"
[OTH],"Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!"
[OTH],I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!
[OTH],That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
[OTH],"I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack!"
[OTH],You can't leave! The show starts soon!
[OTH],"Boys, you've got... three hours to get those two back together. Do I need to remind you what will happen if you don't? Carl!"
[OTH],(OOOWWW!)
[OTH],You bastards!
[OTH],"Good luck, boys."
Cartman,"We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us."
[OTH],"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Earth Day 2001 is in full force. Environmental awareness games, booths, and of course, the entertainment on stage, which is being broadcast live all over the country. This eco-happy crowd is thrilled and waiting in anticipation for the arrival of Terrance and Phillip, who are promised by these four boys."
[OTH],"What a touching and true song. You know, it's true. Republicans are ruining the earth."
[OTH],Republicans are ruining the earth.
[OTH],"Alright. Well, I think I know why most of you tuned in today. How about some Earth Day entertainment?!"
[OTH],"Hooray for the earth! We must protect it. And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video!"
[OTH],On video?
[OTH],They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada. But a fast-paced rocket ride to success would bring them to the depths of despair. This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow.
[OTH],Wow!
[OTH],What the hell do you call this?!
[OTH],"Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month."
[OTH],"We promised people Terrance and Phillip, not a video documentary! You've ruined the earth for the last time, boys!"
[OTH],Aaaahh!
[OTH],"Terrance was born Terrance Henry Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto. At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies. It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle , a brash young baby from Montreal. Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere. At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show . where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time."
[OTH],"And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have two adorable little boys from Canada. Please put your hands together for the music of young Terrance and Phillip."
[OTH],"Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!"
[OTH],"Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!"
[OTH],"It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian."
[OTH],Oooh.
[OTH],"Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!"
[OTH],"The Canadian act confused American audiences. But then something happened that would change Terrance and Phillip's act forever. It was the birth of Canadian comedy. Terrance and Phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art, and meeting some of America's most influential people."
[OTH],"Excuse me, which way is the bus station?"
[OTH],"Hey, you're the guy on the screen."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"But it was in 1974, on the Sonny & Cher Show, that Terrance and Phillip finally started to mix their Canadian humor with deep political insight."
[OTH],"You know, Cher, a lot of us real Americans don't know much about Canada."
[OTH],"Well, a lot of us real Americans aren't as stupid and short as you, hm."
[OTH],Please put your groovy hands together for the young and talented Terrance and Phillip!
[OTH],"Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war."
[OTH],Here's a missile for ya!
[OTH],That's better.
[OTH],"With this bold mix of humor and political insight, the world couldn't get enough of Terrance and Phillip. But their fame would come at a price, when Behind the Blow continues."
[OTH],"Okay. Okay, I think we lost them."
[OTH],"Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!"
Cartman,"Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!"
[OTH],"I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!"
[OTH],"Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason."
[OTH],There they are!
[OTH],Haaah!
[OTH],(Aahhh!)
[OTH],Go! Run run run!
[OTH],"As they entered their late teens, Terrance and Phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success. But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues. The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip. Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were on the cover of every magazine. And then in 1998, even a Saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip. Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices."
[OTH],"Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?"
[OTH],"I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas."
[OTH],"Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said?"
[OTH],"As leader of the goat people, I have seen my species nearly wiped out by your dangerous gas."
[OTH],"Wow, that sucks."
[OTH],"The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998, the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called ""Not Without My Anus."" It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show, the John Schneider Variety Hour , was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie , they were enraged, bewildered, and scared. The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others. The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish. Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars. It was the first time the duo tasted failure , and it nearly killed them both."
[OTH],What's going on here?
[OTH],"Sh. We're watching ""Behind the Blow,"" m'kay."
[OTH],"Come on, Kenny, hurry up!"
[OTH],"After years of depression and suicide attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally decided to get together for one last film: the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer. And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 , in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was considered a great success. After almost being executed by the American government , Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada , where they were touted as heroes. They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through. And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow."
[OTH],Terrance...
[OTH],"Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too."
[OTH],"I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before."
[OTH],Me neither.
[OTH],We sssure did go through a lot together.
[OTH],We sure did.
[OTH],"Terrance, I-"
[OTH],"No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault."
[OTH],"That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault. But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did."
[OTH],"No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone."
[OTH],Think of all the endangered species that will now vanish because of you! Carl!
[OTH],(AH how!)
[OTH],"So long, boys!"
[OTH],"Wait! dude, LOOK!"
[OTH],"Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you."
[OTH],"That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks"
[OTH],"Ohohoho, nohoho!"
[OTH],They're back!
Cartman,Alright!
[OTH],"Yes! Earth Day is saved, boys! Everything worked out after all!"
[OTH],It sure did.
Cartman,"Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!"
[OTH],"(Oh, well now that's sweet.)"
[OTH],"Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted?"
[OTH],"He sure did, Phillip."
[OTH],"NO, I'm asking you his name!"
[OTH],"And so, Terrance and Phillip got back together, proving once and for all that fame and fortune are never as important as friendship."
[OTH],"...And so it is with heavy hearts that we say good-bye to Mabel Louise Cartman. She was a good woman, a community leader, a caring wife, a providing mother , and a loving grandmother"
Cartman,"Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday."
[OTH],"Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over."
Cartman,Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
[OTH],"And now, let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how Mabel touched our lives."
Cartman,God! She didn't take this long to die.
[OTH],And now we release the doves to symbolize the Lord taking Mabel into his arms and giving her everlasting peace.
[OTH],Peace.
Cartman,Great. Now can we go?
[OTH],"No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business."
Cartman,Ogh! God-damnit..!
[OTH],"...""And so I leave my stocks and bonds, worth an estimate fourteen dollars and twelve cents, to be divided amongst my loving family."""
Cartman,"Mom, I wanna go home!"
[OTH],"In a minute, sweetie. This is important."
[OTH],"""To my loving son, Stinky: I leave you the house in Nebraska. Look after it as your father and I did."""
Cartman,Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
[OTH],"""To my grandson Eric: You are always my favorite fat little man, my perfect round little pudding-piler."""
Cartman,"Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!"
[OTH],"""For you, Eric, I leave from my life savings, the sum of one million dollars, to be transferred to you immediately."""
Cartman,Hoosajiggawha?
[OTH],A million dollars?
[OTH],"""Eric is the primary benefactor of my estate, since it is likely the rest of you would spend the money on crack."""
[OTH],Oh my.
[OTH],That can't be!
Cartman,"Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?"
[OTH],"Yes, Eric, it's yours."
Cartman,"No, no, wait, you don't understand. since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars..."
[OTH],"And now, you do."
Cartman,Egh...
[OTH],"""There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"" ""You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."""
[OTH],"""No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"""
[OTH],"""It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."""
[OTH],"""Have mercy!"" Yeah ha ha!"
[OTH],"Yeah, awesome!"
[OTH],panting(You guys! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
[OTH],...Why?
[OTH],(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
[OTH],Nuh uh.
[OTH],"(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)"
[OTH],"You'd better not be lying, Kenny."
[OTH],"Nine hundred ninety nine thousand four hundred, nine hundred ninety nine thousand five hundred..."
[OTH],"Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash."
[OTH],Mm-me neither.
[OTH],"...Nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred, one million."
Cartman,"Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface."
[OTH],"Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?"
Cartman,"I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it."
[OTH],On what?
Cartman,On my dream. On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
[OTH],"Excuse me son, I'm an investment broker; I can help you invest that money."
Cartman,"Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it."
[OTH],"Eric, God could sure use that money for a bigger church."
Cartman,"Huh, I think God has plenty of money."
[OTH],"What the hell are you doing, fatass?!"
Cartman,"Not much, just taking my one million dollars out of the bank."
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],Kenny wasn't lying.
Cartman,Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
[OTH],"Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?"
Cartman,"HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!"
[OTH],Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
Cartman,"Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"No... No, this isn't possible."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's unbelievable."
[OTH],"No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?"
[OTH],"Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money."
[OTH],Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
[OTH],...Aaand if we can just get you to sign here... and here... .
[OTH],"Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?"
Cartman,"My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure."
[OTH],"And now you just sign here, Mr. Fun."
[OTH],I can't do it.
[OTH],What?
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"Uh uh I can't sell this poor kid my park. Look, I haven't been honest with you. The park hasn't been doing great business."
[OTH],Frank...
[OTH],"Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris. The truth is, the park is a financial flop. I haven't turned a profit in years because I can't keep attendance up."
Cartman,"Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come."
[OTH],You... you're not?
Cartman,"No no! I'm buying it to keep people out! Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks. But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds, The rides are great, but... All the lines, lines, LINES! If there's one thing I hate, all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!! And then there get to be so many people that they make FastPass. So then there's lines for FastPass. You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras and rare Kartankulas Plinks! ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it."
[OTH],"Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel bad."
[OTH],"Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours."
Cartman,"Gentlemen, I thank you."
[OTH],"Kyle? Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?"
[OTH],"Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park."
[OTH],"Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--"
[OTH],"Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense! What is your logic?! Ow."
[OTH],"Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already."
Cartman,"Yyeessss! Yyeessss! Awesome! Ho ho! Sweet! Yes! Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft! Yes! Yes! Oh, cool! Oh, look how much fun I had! Whoa! Heheheheh. Ah! Heheh. Whoa! Heh, heheh. Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome! Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess! Yehess! I'm so happy! I'm so happy...!"
[OTH],"Oh, hey, dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start."
[OTH],Great.
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid. Ow.
[OTH],"Heh, heh. Sorry."
[OTH],"So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!"
[OTH],"Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins."
[OTH],"Hunh, I guess you're right."
Cartman,"Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises! And the best part is: You can't come!! That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow! It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!! So come on down to Cartmanland now! But don't plan on getting past the parking lot, 'cause remember: So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come! Especially you, Stan and Kyle."
[OTH],"That does it, dude!"
[OTH],Where are we going?
[OTH],We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not!
Cartman,"Whoa! Heheh. Whoa! Whoa! Heheheheheh. Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the, um, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh."
[OTH],"Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts! Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!"
Cartman,What the hell?
[OTH],Hohohooho! Oowwww!
Cartman,You sons of bitches!
[OTH],"Come on, dude!"
[OTH],"Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!"
Cartman,What the hell are you doing?!
[OTH],"Aw, crap."
[OTH],"Oh God, get me off of here!!"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!"
[OTH],"Alright, let's go."
Cartman,That's right! You stay out!
[OTH],"You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!"
[OTH],My life can't get any worse!
[OTH],You'll see! We'll get in!
Cartman,"...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!"
[OTH],So what does does this job pay?
Cartman,"Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them."
[OTH],"Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides."
Cartman,"But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line."
[OTH],I'm not interested.
Cartman,"Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines."
[OTH],"If you need security, I need a cash salary."
Cartman,But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
[OTH],"Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary."
Cartman,Ugh... Two people?
[OTH],This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.
Cartman,"Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park..."
[OTH],I will shoot on sight.
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you.
[OTH],Lucky.
[OTH],"Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you."
[OTH],"Dude, are you okay?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?"
[OTH],"Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in."
[OTH],Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
[OTH],Jesus.
[OTH],"But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude."
[OTH],"Kyle, don't say such things!"
[OTH],"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?"
[OTH],"Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--"
[OTH],No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
Cartman,"Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day."
[OTH],Aw.
[OTH],That's gay.
Cartman,"I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in."
[OTH],Hoh.
[OTH],Oh.
Cartman,The rest of you will just have to try another day.
[OTH],Aw.
Cartman,"'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir. Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland."
[OTH],"Hoh boy, oh boy!"
Cartman,"...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides. Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again! Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah- What are you doing?"
[OTH],We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
Cartman,Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now?
[OTH],"Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house."
[OTH],Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
Cartman,"Ugh, alright, alright, hang on. Security!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it."
[OTH],"Uh, I'm security, not maintenance."
Cartman,But I don't know how it works.
[OTH],Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.
Cartman,"Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person."
Cartman,"Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day. However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood? Alright, let's go."
[OTH],Timmay!
Cartman,Wait a minute! Who are you?
[OTH],Mike Gainor.
Cartman,"HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!"
[OTH],"Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!"
Cartman,I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
[OTH],"It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!"
Cartman,Get him out of here!
[OTH],"Move along, sir."
[OTH],"AGGH! This isn't over, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides! Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared! AAAGGGHHH...."
[OTH],Agh! Agghh!
[OTH],Just a little more. There we go.
[OTH],"Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?"
[OTH],Awesome.
[OTH],"Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible."
[OTH],I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
[OTH],"Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle. Uh, okay. You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago. Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends."
[OTH],"He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor."
[OTH],"He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God."
[OTH],"But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God."
[OTH],Satan talked to God?
[OTH],"Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, ""Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."""
[OTH],"But Satan said, ""Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."""
[OTH],"To which God said, ""Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."""
[OTH],"And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers."
[OTH],Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees.
[OTH],"And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all."
[OTH],"Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, ""The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away,"" and praised God's name."
[OTH],"So then, Job got painful sores all over his body."
[OTH],"He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith."
[OTH],"God said to Satan, ""See? I told you. Job still praises me."""
[OTH],And that's it? That's the end?
[OTH],Basically.
[OTH],That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
[OTH],"Oh. Uhhh, I don't know."
[OTH],"Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God."
Cartman,"...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day... Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... God-damnit! Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today!"
[OTH],Welcome to Cartmanland.
[OTH],"Isn't he getting any better, doctor?"
[OTH],"I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run."
[OTH],"And now back to Money Quest, on HBC."
[OTH],"Welcome back to Money Quest. In just over two weeks, young financial genius Eric Cartman has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands."
[OTH],"And the way he did it is with the brilliant ""You Can't Come"" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing."
[OTH],"Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now."
[OTH],"No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in."
[OTH],Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy's anymore! Get out of here!
[OTH],Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.
[OTH],Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh...
[OTH],Kyle? Kyle? Get the doctor!
Cartman,"Eh! Goddamnit, stop running into me!"
[OTH],(Woohoo!) (Heeheehee!!)
Cartman,AGH! DAAGGHHHH!!
[OTH],"My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!"
[OTH],He sure did!
[OTH],"Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this!"
Cartman,"Hey, there you are!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success."
Cartman,Just give me my money back.
[OTH],What?
Cartman,I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
[OTH],...But it's doing great!
Cartman,"You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!"
[OTH],You bet! I'll go get your money right now.
[OTH],"Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?"
Cartman,"GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!"
[OTH],"Isn't he responding at all, doctor?"
[OTH],"I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life."
[OTH],But then... are you saying...?
[OTH],There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live.
[OTH],"Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!"
Cartman,"Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass!"
[OTH],Excuse me? Eric Cartman?
Cartman,Yeah?
[OTH],"I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy. Seize the assets."
Cartman,"He-hey, that's my money!"
[OTH],There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this.
Cartman,What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
[OTH],"You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court."
Cartman,"Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!"
[OTH],We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.
Cartman,"No! But I don't... ah... ah... Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back."
[OTH],"Nohoho way, José!"
Cartman,"But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!"
[OTH],"""I don't care,"" said Pierre. ""I'm from France."""
Cartman,This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
[OTH],"Kyle, you gotta see!!"
[OTH],"Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald!"
[OTH],"Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?"
[OTH],"Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I--"
[OTH],"Then damnit man, do it!"
Cartman,"It isn't fair! You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair!"
[OTH],"Look, Kyle. Look."
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?!"
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,I'M SO PISSED OFF!
[OTH],"Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property!"
Cartman,"Ey! You used to work for me! Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch!"
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],He's coming back.
[OTH],"That's it, baby. That's it."
Cartman,"Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!"
[OTH],Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is going into remission!
[OTH],"Oh, shit!"
[OTH],"Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable. Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it."
Cartman,It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie!
[OTH],You are up there!
[OTH],"...And so it is with heavy hearts that we say good-bye to Mabel Louise Cartman. She was a good woman, a community leader, a caring wife, a providing mother , and a loving grandmother"
Cartman,"Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday."
[OTH],"Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over."
Cartman,Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
[OTH],"And now, let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how Mabel touched our lives."
Cartman,God! She didn't take this long to die.
[OTH],And now we release the doves to symbolize the Lord taking Mabel into his arms and giving her everlasting peace.
[OTH],Peace.
Cartman,Great. Now can we go?
[OTH],"No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business."
Cartman,Ogh! God-damnit..!
[OTH],"...""And so I leave my stocks and bonds, worth an estimate fourteen dollars and twelve cents, to be divided amongst my loving family."""
Cartman,"Mom, I wanna go home!"
[OTH],"In a minute, sweetie. This is important."
[OTH],"""To my loving son, Stinky: I leave you the house in Nebraska. Look after it as your father and I did."""
Cartman,Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
[OTH],"""To my grandson Eric: You are always my favorite fat little man, my perfect round little pudding-piler."""
Cartman,"Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!"
[OTH],"""For you, Eric, I leave from my life savings, the sum of one million dollars, to be transferred to you immediately."""
Cartman,Hoosajiggawha?
[OTH],A million dollars?
[OTH],"""Eric is the primary benefactor of my estate, since it is likely the rest of you would spend the money on crack."""
[OTH],Oh my.
[OTH],That can't be!
Cartman,"Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?"
[OTH],"Yes, Eric, it's yours."
Cartman,"No, no, wait, you don't understand. since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars..."
[OTH],"And now, you do."
Cartman,Egh...
[OTH],"""There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"" ""You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."""
[OTH],"""No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"""
[OTH],"""It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."""
[OTH],"""Have mercy!"" Yeah ha ha!"
[OTH],"Yeah, awesome!"
[OTH],panting(You guys! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
[OTH],...Why?
[OTH],(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
[OTH],Nuh uh.
[OTH],"(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)"
[OTH],"You'd better not be lying, Kenny."
[OTH],"Nine hundred ninety nine thousand four hundred, nine hundred ninety nine thousand five hundred..."
[OTH],"Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash."
[OTH],Mm-me neither.
[OTH],"...Nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred, one million."
Cartman,"Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface."
[OTH],"Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?"
Cartman,"I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it."
[OTH],On what?
Cartman,On my dream. On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
[OTH],"Excuse me son, I'm an investment broker; I can help you invest that money."
Cartman,"Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it."
[OTH],"Eric, God could sure use that money for a bigger church."
Cartman,"Huh, I think God has plenty of money."
[OTH],"What the hell are you doing, fatass?!"
Cartman,"Not much, just taking my one million dollars out of the bank."
[OTH],Oh my God.
[OTH],Kenny wasn't lying.
Cartman,Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
[OTH],"Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?"
Cartman,"HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!"
[OTH],Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
Cartman,"Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!"
[OTH],"No... No, this isn't possible."
[OTH],"Yeah, it's unbelievable."
[OTH],"No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?"
[OTH],"Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money."
[OTH],Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
[OTH],...Aaand if we can just get you to sign here... and here... .
[OTH],"Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?"
Cartman,"My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure."
[OTH],"And now you just sign here, Mr. Fun."
[OTH],I can't do it.
[OTH],What?
Cartman,What?!
[OTH],"Uh uh I can't sell this poor kid my park. Look, I haven't been honest with you. The park hasn't been doing great business."
[OTH],Frank...
[OTH],"Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris. The truth is, the park is a financial flop. I haven't turned a profit in years because I can't keep attendance up."
Cartman,"Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come."
[OTH],You... you're not?
Cartman,"No no! I'm buying it to keep people out! Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks. But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds, The rides are great, but... All the lines, lines, LINES! If there's one thing I hate, all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!! And then there get to be so many people that they make FastPass. So then there's lines for FastPass. You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras and rare Kartankulas Plinks! ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it."
[OTH],"Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel bad."
[OTH],"Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours."
Cartman,"Gentlemen, I thank you."
[OTH],"Kyle? Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?"
[OTH],"Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park."
[OTH],"Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--"
[OTH],"Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense! What is your logic?! Ow."
[OTH],"Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already."
Cartman,"Yyeessss! Yyeessss! Awesome! Ho ho! Sweet! Yes! Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft! Yes! Yes! Oh, cool! Oh, look how much fun I had! Whoa! Heheheheh. Ah! Heheh. Whoa! Heh, heheh. Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome! Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess! Yehess! I'm so happy! I'm so happy...!"
[OTH],"Oh, hey, dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start."
[OTH],Great.
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid. Ow.
[OTH],"Heh, heh. Sorry."
[OTH],"So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!"
[OTH],"Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins."
[OTH],"Hunh, I guess you're right."
Cartman,"Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises! And the best part is: You can't come!! That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow! It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!! So come on down to Cartmanland now! But don't plan on getting past the parking lot, 'cause remember: So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come! Especially you, Stan and Kyle."
[OTH],"That does it, dude!"
[OTH],Where are we going?
[OTH],We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not!
Cartman,"Whoa! Heheh. Whoa! Whoa! Heheheheheh. Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the, um, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh."
[OTH],"Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts! Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!"
Cartman,What the hell?
[OTH],Hohohooho! Oowwww!
Cartman,You sons of bitches!
[OTH],"Come on, dude!"
[OTH],"Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!"
Cartman,What the hell are you doing?!
[OTH],"Aw, crap."
[OTH],"Oh God, get me off of here!!"
[OTH],Dude!
[OTH],"Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!"
[OTH],"Alright, let's go."
Cartman,That's right! You stay out!
[OTH],"You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!"
[OTH],My life can't get any worse!
[OTH],You'll see! We'll get in!
Cartman,"...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!"
[OTH],So what does does this job pay?
Cartman,"Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them."
[OTH],"Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides."
Cartman,"But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line."
[OTH],I'm not interested.
Cartman,"Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines."
[OTH],"If you need security, I need a cash salary."
Cartman,But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
[OTH],"Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary."
Cartman,Ugh... Two people?
[OTH],This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.
Cartman,"Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park..."
[OTH],I will shoot on sight.
Cartman,Sweet.
[OTH],You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you.
[OTH],Lucky.
[OTH],"Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you."
[OTH],"Dude, are you okay?"
[OTH],"Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?"
[OTH],"Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in."
[OTH],Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
[OTH],Jesus.
[OTH],"But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude."
[OTH],"Kyle, don't say such things!"
[OTH],"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?"
[OTH],"Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--"
[OTH],No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
Cartman,"Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day."
[OTH],Aw.
[OTH],That's gay.
Cartman,"I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in."
[OTH],Hoh.
[OTH],Oh.
Cartman,The rest of you will just have to try another day.
[OTH],Aw.
Cartman,"'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir. Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland."
[OTH],"Hoh boy, oh boy!"
Cartman,"...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides. Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again! Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah- What are you doing?"
[OTH],We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
Cartman,Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now?
[OTH],"Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house."
[OTH],Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
Cartman,"Ugh, alright, alright, hang on. Security!"
[OTH],What?
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it."
[OTH],"Uh, I'm security, not maintenance."
Cartman,But I don't know how it works.
[OTH],Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.
Cartman,"Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person."
Cartman,"Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day. However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood? Alright, let's go."
[OTH],Timmay!
Cartman,Wait a minute! Who are you?
[OTH],Mike Gainor.
Cartman,"HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!"
[OTH],"Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!"
Cartman,I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
[OTH],"It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!"
Cartman,Get him out of here!
[OTH],"Move along, sir."
[OTH],"AGGH! This isn't over, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides! Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared! AAAGGGHHH...."
[OTH],Agh! Agghh!
[OTH],Just a little more. There we go.
[OTH],"Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?"
[OTH],Awesome.
[OTH],"Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible."
[OTH],I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
[OTH],"Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle. Uh, okay. You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago. Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends."
[OTH],"He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor."
[OTH],"He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God."
[OTH],"But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God."
[OTH],Satan talked to God?
[OTH],"Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, ""Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."""
[OTH],"But Satan said, ""Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."""
[OTH],"To which God said, ""Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."""
[OTH],"And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers."
[OTH],Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees.
[OTH],"And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all."
[OTH],"Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, ""The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away,"" and praised God's name."
[OTH],"So then, Job got painful sores all over his body."
[OTH],"He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith."
[OTH],"God said to Satan, ""See? I told you. Job still praises me."""
[OTH],And that's it? That's the end?
[OTH],Basically.
[OTH],That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
[OTH],"Oh. Uhhh, I don't know."
[OTH],"Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God."
Cartman,"...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day... Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... God-damnit! Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today!"
[OTH],Welcome to Cartmanland.
[OTH],"Isn't he getting any better, doctor?"
[OTH],"I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run."
[OTH],"And now back to Money Quest, on HBC."
[OTH],"Welcome back to Money Quest. In just over two weeks, young financial genius Eric Cartman has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands."
[OTH],"And the way he did it is with the brilliant ""You Can't Come"" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing."
[OTH],"Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country."
[OTH],"I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now."
[OTH],"No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in."
[OTH],Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy's anymore! Get out of here!
[OTH],Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.
[OTH],Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh...
[OTH],Kyle? Kyle? Get the doctor!
Cartman,"Eh! Goddamnit, stop running into me!"
[OTH],(Woohoo!) (Heeheehee!!)
Cartman,AGH! DAAGGHHHH!!
[OTH],"My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!"
[OTH],He sure did!
[OTH],"Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this!"
Cartman,"Hey, there you are!"
[OTH],"Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success."
Cartman,Just give me my money back.
[OTH],What?
Cartman,I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
[OTH],...But it's doing great!
Cartman,"You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!"
[OTH],You bet! I'll go get your money right now.
[OTH],"Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?"
Cartman,"GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!"
[OTH],"Isn't he responding at all, doctor?"
[OTH],"I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life."
[OTH],But then... are you saying...?
[OTH],There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live.
[OTH],"Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!"
Cartman,"Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass!"
[OTH],Excuse me? Eric Cartman?
Cartman,Yeah?
[OTH],"I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy. Seize the assets."
Cartman,"He-hey, that's my money!"
[OTH],There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this.
Cartman,What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
[OTH],"You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court."
Cartman,"Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!"
[OTH],We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.
Cartman,"No! But I don't... ah... ah... Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back."
[OTH],"Nohoho way, José!"
Cartman,"But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!"
[OTH],"""I don't care,"" said Pierre. ""I'm from France."""
Cartman,This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
[OTH],"Kyle, you gotta see!!"
[OTH],"Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald!"
[OTH],"Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?"
[OTH],"Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I--"
[OTH],"Then damnit man, do it!"
Cartman,"It isn't fair! You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair!"
[OTH],"Look, Kyle. Look."
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,"You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?!"
[OTH],Huh?
Cartman,I'M SO PISSED OFF!
[OTH],"Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property!"
Cartman,"Ey! You used to work for me! Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch!"
[OTH],Kyle!
[OTH],He's coming back.
[OTH],"That's it, baby. That's it."
Cartman,"Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!"
[OTH],Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is going into remission!
[OTH],"Oh, shit!"
[OTH],"Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable. Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it."
Cartman,It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie!
[OTH],You are up there!
[OTH],"""So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"""
[OTH],"""No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."""
[OTH],"""That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures"""
[OTH],"""Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"""
[OTH],"""Scream for me, bitch!"""
[OTH],"""AAAAAAAH!"""
[OTH],Whoa! Awesome!
Cartman,"Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!"
[OTH],"Oh no, what now?"
Cartman,"No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on!"
[OTH],"What's this all about, Kenny?"
[OTH],(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
Cartman,"Watch this. It's sooo funny. Come 'ere, Garland, come on. Good dog. Red rocket red rocket. Red rocket. Red rocket. Come on."
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
Cartman,I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
[OTH],No they don't!
[OTH],(Yeah they do!)
Cartman,"Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it. Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket! Ohooohhh!"
[OTH],"Whoa, cool!"
[OTH],That's awesome!
Cartman,I told you guys.
[OTH],I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Cartman,"Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away."
[OTH],"You ""beat off?"""
Cartman,That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off. Don't you guys know anything?
[OTH],"Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?"
Cartman,"Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here!"
[OTH],I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
[OTH],Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
[OTH],"Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?"
[OTH],But it's super-cool!
[OTH],"Later, sweetie. Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery."
[OTH],Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.
[OTH],"Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence:"
[OTH],"Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket."
[OTH],"""Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"" ""-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."" It's amazing how with three images he puts you right there, and..."
[OTH],"Red rocket, red rocket!"
[OTH],WAAAH!
[OTH],"Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!"
[OTH],"I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket."
[OTH],"STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!"
[OTH],My room? Why?
[OTH],"Go, Stanley! Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades."
[OTH],"Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company! Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!"
[OTH],Why?! What's the big deal?!
[OTH],"Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??"
[OTH],"I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out."
[OTH],"No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual."
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],"You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!"
[OTH],"Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out. Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!"
[OTH],What things??
[OTH],Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!"
[OTH],Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone!
[OTH],"Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time."
[OTH],"Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age."
[OTH],School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.
[OTH],It isn't soon enough.
[OTH],"Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog."
[OTH],"Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while."
[OTH],"Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex."
[OTH],The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
[OTH],"No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education. From the school."
[OTH],"Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to."
[OTH],"Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like ""penis"" and ""vagina."" Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay. Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum. STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral! M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh... let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm."
[OTH],"Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?"
[OTH],"Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh... I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??"
[OTH],"Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it."
[OTH],"Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited."
[OTH],"Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we? SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!! That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?"
[OTH],I didn't mean that-
[OTH],"Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, ""It's not going to happen to me."" You say, ""Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado."" WRONG! Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences! You think that sex is about fun and games and love? Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes."
[OTH],AAAHHH!
[OTH],And here's a little syphilis for you!
[OTH],AAAHHH!
[OTH],"That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!"
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],Hey Chef.
[OTH],How is sexual education class going?
[OTH],It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
[OTH],"Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life."
[OTH],"Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?"
[OTH],"...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line."
[OTH],Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey Wendy, did you guys get-"
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],What the hell is wrong with them?
[OTH],"You guys, we just wanna know-"
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],"Stay away from me, Stan!"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Are you wearing a condom?
[OTH],...A what?
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],Do any of you have your condoms on?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
[OTH],Nuh uh.
[OTH],"Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS."
Cartman,AIDS?
[OTH],"Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas."
[OTH],Is that what you learned in sex ed?
Cartman,Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
[OTH],"Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything."
[OTH],"You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS."
[OTH],"But Wendy, we don't understand how that-"
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],"Oh my God, dude."
[OTH],"Uh what are we gonna do, huh?"
[OTH],"Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Can I help you boys?
[OTH],"Yeah, we need condoms!"
[OTH],Condoms?
[OTH],Yeah. Quick!
[OTH],How old are you boys?
[OTH],Why does that matter?
[OTH],Ha-I'll be nine next week.
[OTH],"Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms."
[OTH],Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
[OTH],I just don't think kids your age should be-
[OTH],"Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them."
[OTH],But... they're... children!
[OTH],Would you rather them do it unprotected?
Cartman,"Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!"
[OTH],I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
[OTH],"Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected."
[OTH],"Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side."
[OTH],I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
[OTH],"Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty."
[OTH],"Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?"
[OTH],"No, you have to change it."
[OTH],"Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things."
[OTH],"Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik."
[OTH],"Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway."
[OTH],"Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... ""missed"" anything."
[OTH],Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.
[OTH],"Right! Oral sex, which of course would be..."
[OTH],Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.
[OTH],"Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay."
[OTH],It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.
[OTH],"Yeah, why d-uh, did you?"
[OTH],Did I what?
[OTH],"Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers."
[OTH],"Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin. But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college. I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses. The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm... I'm sorry."
[OTH],"People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand."
[OTH],"Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh, anyhow And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college."
[OTH],Your nickname?
[OTH],"""That guy with the really big head."""
[OTH],...Right.
[OTH],"Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm."
[OTH],"Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me."
[OTH],Neither have I.
[OTH],"Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?"
[OTH],"Uh not me! Huhuh, okay."
[OTH],"Well, back to the lesson plan, then."
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"Okay. ""Oral Sex"""
[OTH],Doesn't it give any other directions?
[OTH],"Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener. ""If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"""
[OTH],"Uh, what are ""studzes"""
[OTH],"How the heck should I know? Why, it's just a little doughnut. Hoh- it's all gooey."
Cartman,"Just put it on, Butters."
[OTH],Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
Cartman,"Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?"
[OTH],"Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man. O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky."
[OTH],It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
[OTH],"I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see."
[OTH],"Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!"
Cartman,"I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
[OTH],"Ah, I got rubber bands."
[OTH],"Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh. Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on."
[OTH],How do you feel?
[OTH],...Pretty good.
Cartman,Do you feel protected?
[OTH],"Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it."
[OTH],"Alright, here, everybody. Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on."
[OTH],Timmehah!
[OTH],"Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use."
[OTH],"I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade."
[OTH],But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
[OTH],...Kindergarten.
[OTH],Kindergarten?!
[OTH],We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.
[OTH],"Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!"
[OTH],I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
[OTH],I guess we have no choice.
[OTH],"Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is? Yes, Jenny?"
[OTH],It flies around and it's endangered.
[OTH],"That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor. Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs. Yes, Filmore?"
[OTH],Can we do fingerpaint?
[OTH],"NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom. First of all you remove the condom from its package. Then you find which way the condom rolls out. Put it in your mouth... And apply. And it's as simple as that. Any questions?"
[OTH],"Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all. PREGNANCY! That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?!"
[OTH],Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth. The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking.
[OTH],Eeeeww.
[OTH],"Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born. but Mom's not done yet."
[OTH],Eeww.
[OTH],She still got some afterbirth to push out of her.
[OTH],AAAAAAAA!!!!
[OTH],That's right.
[OTH],Girls! Girls! Where are you going?!
[OTH],"Man, this condom's driving me crazy."
[OTH],Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
Cartman,"Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier."
[OTH],"Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay. M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening. This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?"
Cartman,I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
[OTH],Why are you wearing a condom?
Cartman,So I don't get AIDS.
[OTH],"Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex."
[OTH],From sex??
[OTH],Yes.
[OTH],"You mean, intercourse with a girl?"
[OTH],"Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye."
[OTH],All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
Cartman,I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
[OTH],Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
[OTH],"Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!"
[OTH],"Yeah, come on guys, this is war!"
[OTH],Yeah! That's right! Come on!
[OTH],"And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay."
[OTH],"Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?"
[OTH],Miss'nary position?
[OTH],"Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?"
[OTH],Doggie?
[OTH],"That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm."
[OTH],Pile driver?
[OTH],"Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid."
[OTH],The Filthy Sanchez?
[OTH],"Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez."
[OTH],Hot Karl?
[OTH],"Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure."
[OTH],"There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out."
[OTH],"Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!"
[OTH],Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
[OTH],Ha! They're your diseases!
[OTH],Yeah! You get out of town!
Cartman,"Here, talk to them, Butters."
[OTH],"Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?"
Cartman,"Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence."
[OTH],Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
[OTH],"Man, he's pretty good."
[OTH],We'll never walk away. Never!
[OTH],(Waa-ooo!)
Cartman,"Oh, bitch!"
[OTH],That does it! Attack!
[OTH],"M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay."
[OTH],I've already gone through that with the girls. It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?
[OTH],"Why, sure. Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm... Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan."
[OTH],Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse.
[OTH],"Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples."
[OTH],Or the... shaft... of the penis?
[OTH],"It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay."
[OTH],"Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the... clitoris of the woman."
[OTH],And these... are the two areas most important to-
[OTH],"Sexual stimulation. Oh, is this wrong?"
[OTH],"I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong. I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik."
[OTH],Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?
[OTH],I go crazy.
[OTH],Do you touch yourself?
[OTH],Yeah. Hmm.
[OTH],Haawww. Haawww.
[OTH],"G'oh, m'kay."
[OTH],"Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!"
[OTH],"Huh, what's wrong?"
[OTH],It's your turn.
[OTH],"Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. M' kay! M'kay!"
[OTH],Do you want me?
[OTH],I do.
[OTH],Tell me.
[OTH],I want you. M'kay.
[OTH],Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?
[OTH],Well. No.
[OTH],"Oh well, fuck it Oh God, give it to me!"
[OTH],Oh yeah. Woh.
[OTH],"Woh. Ooh, that's it baby! That's it!"
[OTH],"Aw, this feels so good, m'kay."
[OTH],WAAAAHHH!!
[OTH],Waaaahh!!
[OTH],What the hell was that?
[OTH],Did you feel something?
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],Jesus Christ.
Cartman,"Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now."
[OTH],"Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves."
[OTH],We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
[OTH],I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.
[OTH],Oooohhh.
[OTH],"Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know, someone who has a bad opinion of it, or even a complete pervert."
[OTH],Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?
[OTH],He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.
[OTH],This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
[OTH],"It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject."
[OTH],Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?"
[OTH],"It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17."
[OTH],Seventeen?
[OTH],Seventeen.
[OTH],So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
[OTH],"Nope, just 17."
[OTH],"But, what if you're not ready at 17?"
[OTH],Seventeen! You're ready.
[OTH],"Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?"
[OTH],Yeah. Thank God.
Cartman,"Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy! That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now."
[OTH],"Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm."
[OTH],"""So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"""
[OTH],"""No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."""
[OTH],"""That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures"""
[OTH],"""Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"""
[OTH],"""Scream for me, bitch!"""
[OTH],"""AAAAAAAH!"""
[OTH],Whoa! Awesome!
Cartman,"Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!"
[OTH],"Oh no, what now?"
Cartman,"No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on!"
[OTH],"What's this all about, Kenny?"
[OTH],(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
Cartman,"Watch this. It's sooo funny. Come 'ere, Garland, come on. Good dog. Red rocket red rocket. Red rocket. Red rocket. Come on."
[OTH],"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
Cartman,I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
[OTH],No they don't!
[OTH],(Yeah they do!)
Cartman,"Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it. Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket! Ohooohhh!"
[OTH],"Whoa, cool!"
[OTH],That's awesome!
Cartman,I told you guys.
[OTH],I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Cartman,"Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away."
[OTH],"You ""beat off?"""
Cartman,That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off. Don't you guys know anything?
[OTH],"Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?"
Cartman,"Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here!"
[OTH],I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
[OTH],Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
[OTH],"Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?"
[OTH],But it's super-cool!
[OTH],"Later, sweetie. Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery."
[OTH],Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.
[OTH],"Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence:"
[OTH],"Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket."
[OTH],"""Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"" ""-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."" It's amazing how with three images he puts you right there, and..."
[OTH],"Red rocket, red rocket!"
[OTH],WAAAH!
[OTH],"Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!"
[OTH],"I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket."
[OTH],"STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!"
[OTH],My room? Why?
[OTH],"Go, Stanley! Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades."
[OTH],"Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?"
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company! Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!"
[OTH],Why?! What's the big deal?!
[OTH],"Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??"
[OTH],"I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out."
[OTH],"No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual."
[OTH],Huh??
[OTH],"You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!"
[OTH],"Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out. Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!"
[OTH],What things??
[OTH],Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?
[OTH],No!
[OTH],"Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!"
[OTH],Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone!
[OTH],"Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time."
[OTH],"Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age."
[OTH],School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.
[OTH],It isn't soon enough.
[OTH],"Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog."
[OTH],"Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while."
[OTH],"Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex."
[OTH],The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
[OTH],"No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education. From the school."
[OTH],"Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to."
[OTH],"Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like ""penis"" and ""vagina."" Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay. Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum. STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral! M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh... let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm."
[OTH],"Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?"
[OTH],"Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh... I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??"
[OTH],"Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it."
[OTH],"Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited."
[OTH],"Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!"
[OTH],Yeah!
[OTH],"Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we? SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!! That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?"
[OTH],I didn't mean that-
[OTH],"Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, ""It's not going to happen to me."" You say, ""Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado."" WRONG! Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences! You think that sex is about fun and games and love? Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes."
[OTH],AAAHHH!
[OTH],And here's a little syphilis for you!
[OTH],AAAHHH!
[OTH],"That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!"
[OTH],"Hello there, children."
[OTH],Hey Chef.
[OTH],How is sexual education class going?
[OTH],It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
[OTH],"Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life."
[OTH],"Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?"
[OTH],"...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line."
[OTH],Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey Wendy, did you guys get-"
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],What the hell is wrong with them?
[OTH],"You guys, we just wanna know-"
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],"Stay away from me, Stan!"
[OTH],Why?
[OTH],Are you wearing a condom?
[OTH],...A what?
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],Do any of you have your condoms on?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
[OTH],Nuh uh.
[OTH],"Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS."
Cartman,AIDS?
[OTH],"Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas."
[OTH],Is that what you learned in sex ed?
Cartman,Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
[OTH],"Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything."
[OTH],"You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS."
[OTH],"But Wendy, we don't understand how that-"
[OTH],AAAAHHH!
[OTH],"Oh my God, dude."
[OTH],"Uh what are we gonna do, huh?"
[OTH],"Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick."
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Can I help you boys?
[OTH],"Yeah, we need condoms!"
[OTH],Condoms?
[OTH],Yeah. Quick!
[OTH],How old are you boys?
[OTH],Why does that matter?
[OTH],Ha-I'll be nine next week.
[OTH],"Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms."
[OTH],Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
[OTH],I just don't think kids your age should be-
[OTH],"Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them."
[OTH],But... they're... children!
[OTH],Would you rather them do it unprotected?
Cartman,"Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!"
[OTH],I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
[OTH],"Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected."
[OTH],"Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side."
[OTH],I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
[OTH],"Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty."
[OTH],"Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?"
[OTH],"No, you have to change it."
[OTH],"Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things."
[OTH],"Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik."
[OTH],"Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway."
[OTH],"Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... ""missed"" anything."
[OTH],Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.
[OTH],"Right! Oral sex, which of course would be..."
[OTH],Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.
[OTH],"Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay."
[OTH],It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.
[OTH],"Yeah, why d-uh, did you?"
[OTH],Did I what?
[OTH],"Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers."
[OTH],"Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin. But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college. I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses. The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days."
[OTH],"Oh, I'm... I'm sorry."
[OTH],"People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand."
[OTH],"Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh, anyhow And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college."
[OTH],Your nickname?
[OTH],"""That guy with the really big head."""
[OTH],...Right.
[OTH],"Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm."
[OTH],"Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me."
[OTH],Neither have I.
[OTH],"Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?"
[OTH],"Uh not me! Huhuh, okay."
[OTH],"Well, back to the lesson plan, then."
[OTH],Right.
[OTH],"Okay. ""Oral Sex"""
[OTH],Doesn't it give any other directions?
[OTH],"Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener. ""If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"""
[OTH],"Uh, what are ""studzes"""
[OTH],"How the heck should I know? Why, it's just a little doughnut. Hoh- it's all gooey."
Cartman,"Just put it on, Butters."
[OTH],Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
Cartman,"Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?"
[OTH],"Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man. O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky."
[OTH],It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
[OTH],"I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see."
[OTH],"Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!"
Cartman,"I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!"
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
[OTH],"Ah, I got rubber bands."
[OTH],"Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh. Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on."
[OTH],How do you feel?
[OTH],...Pretty good.
Cartman,Do you feel protected?
[OTH],"Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it."
[OTH],"Alright, here, everybody. Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on."
[OTH],Timmehah!
[OTH],"Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use."
[OTH],"I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade."
[OTH],But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
[OTH],...Kindergarten.
[OTH],Kindergarten?!
[OTH],We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.
[OTH],"Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!"
[OTH],I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
[OTH],I guess we have no choice.
[OTH],"Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is? Yes, Jenny?"
[OTH],It flies around and it's endangered.
[OTH],"That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor. Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs. Yes, Filmore?"
[OTH],Can we do fingerpaint?
[OTH],"NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom. First of all you remove the condom from its package. Then you find which way the condom rolls out. Put it in your mouth... And apply. And it's as simple as that. Any questions?"
[OTH],"Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all. PREGNANCY! That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?!"
[OTH],Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth. The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking.

[OTH],"Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure."
[OTH],"There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out."
[OTH],"Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!"
[OTH],Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!

[OTH],We'll never walk away. Never!

[OTH],I've already gone through that with the girls. It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?
[OTH],"Why, sure. Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm... Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan."
[OTH],Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse.
[OTH],"Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples."
[OTH],Or the... shaft... of the penis?
[OTH],"It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay."
[OTH],"Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the... clitoris of the woman."
[OTH],And these... are the two areas most important to-
[OTH],"Sexual stimulation. Oh, is this wrong?"
[OTH],"I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong. I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik."
[OTH],Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?
[OTH],I go crazy.
[OTH],Do you touch yourself?
[OTH],Yeah. Hmm.
[OTH],Haawww. Haawww.
[OTH],"G'oh, m'kay."
[OTH],"Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!"
[OTH],"Huh, what's wrong?"
[OTH],It's your turn.
[OTH],"Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. M' kay! M'kay!"
[OTH],Do you want me?
[OTH],I do.
[OTH],Tell me.
[OTH],I want you. M'kay.
[OTH],Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?
[OTH],Well. No.
[OTH],"Oh well, fuck it Oh God, give it to me!"
[OTH],Oh yeah. Woh.
[OTH],"Woh. Ooh, that's it baby! That's it!"
[OTH],"Aw, this feels so good, m'kay."
[OTH],WAAAAHHH!!
[OTH],Waaaahh!!
[OTH],What the hell was that?
[OTH],Did you feel something?
[OTH],"Oh, no!"
[OTH],Jesus Christ.
Cartman,"Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now."
[OTH],"Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves."
[OTH],We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
[OTH],I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.
[OTH],Oooohhh.
[OTH],"Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved."
[OTH],Huh?
[OTH],"Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know, someone who has a bad opinion of it, or even a complete pervert."
[OTH],Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?
[OTH],He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.
[OTH],This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
[OTH],"It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject."
[OTH],Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
[OTH],Hooray!
[OTH],"But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?"
[OTH],"It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17."
[OTH],Seventeen?
[OTH],Seventeen.
[OTH],So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
[OTH],"Nope, just 17."
[OTH],"But, what if you're not ready at 17?"
[OTH],Seventeen! You're ready.
[OTH],"Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?"
[OTH],Yeah. Thank God.
Cartman,"Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy! That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now."
[OTH],"Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm."
[OTH],HA! I killed you!
[OTH],"HA, I blew your head off!"
[OTH],"(Aw, Goddamnit!)"
[OTH],"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?"
[OTH],"Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?"
Cartman,Let a man take a crap!
[OTH],"Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet."
[OTH],"Hyeah, that poor, poor thing"
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!"
Cartman,"I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper."
[OTH],"Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?"
Cartman,"Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody."
[OTH],Are you guys still playing that video game?
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom."
Cartman,"Look. But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through."
[OTH],"Eric, put that down!"
Cartman,Why?
[OTH],Just go put it back in the trashcan!
Cartman,"Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive."
[OTH],No that... that came from me; just put it away.
Cartman,This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
[OTH],"What is it, Mom?"
[OTH],"Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?"
[OTH],"Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing. I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting."
[OTH],The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],Cool!
Cartman,"Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!"
[OTH],There it is. The Okama GameSphere.
[OTH],"Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],"Don't know, but it kicks ass. Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park."
Cartman,"Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere."
[OTH],"Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!"
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Awesome! Oh, crap."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
[OTH],"Dude, we got GameSphere."
[OTH],"I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake."
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, ""Don't forget to bring a towel."""
[OTH],...O-kay.
[OTH],"Thanks, Towelie."
[OTH],Do you wanna get high?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games."
Cartman,"Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere."
[OTH],"Here you go, boys."
[OTH],AAAAAA.
[OTH],"Okay, turn it on."
[OTH],"""Okama GameSphere""!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Thirst For BLOOD!
Cartman,"Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it."
[OTH],"Oh, this is so cool."
Cartman,"Bring it, bring it!"
[OTH],"Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late."
[OTH],"G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere."
Cartman,"Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Nothing. Come on, Randy."
[OTH],"Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got- wha-what is it?"
Cartman,Date-rape psychosis.
[OTH],"Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon. I don't have to go outside!"
Cartman,Awesome!
[OTH],"She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight.."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!"
Cartman,We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
[OTH],"Well, it's alright. We can still play for six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball."
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel.
[OTH],Uh no.
[OTH],"When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, ""Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."""
[OTH],"Okay, we will."
[OTH],Alright! Do you wanna get high?
[OTH],No we don't wanna get high!
[OTH],Okay... You sure?
Cartman,"Yes! Go away, you stupid towel!"
[OTH],"Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!"
Cartman,That's... so... cool!
[OTH],"Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now."
[OTH],"No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer."
[OTH],"No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school."
Cartman,It's Monday?
[OTH],"Oh, uh, I'm sick."
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],"No, you're not sick. Now get to school. All of you."
[OTH],But Mom...
[OTH],Go!
[OTH],Aagh!
[OTH],Can't believe we have to go to school!
[OTH],"Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid."
[OTH],We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere.
[OTH],"Hello, boys, how are you?"
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere."
[OTH],What? You mean Towelie?
[OTH],"Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at... Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado!"
Cartman,"What, dude?"
[OTH],This is gonna be one looong-ass day.
[OTH],That was the longest day of school ever!
[OTH],"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29!"
[OTH],Where is it?
[OTH],It... it was right here.
[OTH],Where the hell is it??
Cartman,"Come on, man, this isn't funny! I need my fix!"
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel."
[OTH],What? Who-who is this?
[OTH],Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else!
[OTH],Don't hurt it!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
Cartman,No! ...No!
[OTH],"Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!"
[OTH],Towelie!
Cartman,"Hey, towel!"
[OTH],Where the hell is he?
[OTH],(I don't know. Where could it be?)
[OTH],"I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him."
[OTH],What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Cartman,Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. Gebaayybeh! Gebaayybeh!
[OTH],That's a towel call?
[OTH],This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
[OTH],"Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water."
[OTH],"Hey yeah. Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! Aaah. Let's go take a shower! Let's go waterskiing!"
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel.
[OTH],There he is!
[OTH],Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. .
[OTH],"Come on, dude!"
[OTH],Where are we goin'?
[OTH],Just come on! It's getting dark.
[OTH],Are we gonna get high?
[OTH],Are you sure this is where they said to be?
[OTH],They said the gas station outside of town.
[OTH],"Well, I'm gonna get a little high."
[OTH],Hold it!
[OTH],Who is that?
[OTH],Step... away... from the towel!
[OTH],"There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you."
[OTH],"If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel."
[OTH],"It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you."
[OTH],"'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games."
[OTH],Your what?
[OTH],"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!"
[OTH],I don't know what you're talking about.
[OTH],You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
[OTH],"Omigod! IT""S A TRAP!!"
[OTH],Cover! Cover!
[OTH],"Goddamnit, what now?!"
[OTH],"Run, towel!"
[OTH],"Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere."
[OTH],Where's the towel?!
[OTH],"It can't be far! Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!"
[OTH],Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!
[OTH],Where is our Okama GameSphere?
[OTH],"Get the towel home They will explain everything. Please, hurry!"
[OTH],"Aw, God-damnit!"
[OTH],"Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?"
[OTH],"What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away."
[OTH],"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys."
[OTH],Well?
[OTH],"They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air."
[OTH],Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel. They must have some unexplainable bond with it.
[OTH],"Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T."
[OTH],"It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B."
[OTH],You mean...?
[OTH],Yes. Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius.
[OTH],Are we getting close?
[OTH],I think so.
[OTH],"A little more gas, Kenny."
[OTH],How long has it been since you've been back there.
[OTH],"I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important."
Cartman,No it isn't.
[OTH],Is!
Cartman,No it isn't.
[OTH],"Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road."
[OTH],"Brake, Kenny, brake."
Cartman,Egh!
[OTH],M-maybe it's down that dirt road.
[OTH],"Dude, don't you remember where it is?"
[OTH],"I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high. then I'll remember where it is."
[OTH],"Alright, so where is it?"
[OTH],Where's what?
[OTH],Agh!
[OTH],The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is!
[OTH],"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!"
[OTH],Well calm down.
[OTH],That's it! You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
[OTH],"That's my last joint, asshole!"
[OTH],I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
[OTH],"Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit."
[OTH],"Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil. Kevin, is that you?"
[OTH],Harris! Reach bang and clear!
[OTH],Hello? WAAH! Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod!
[OTH],"Alright, it's clear! It's clear!"
[OTH],HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
[OTH],Let's go let's go!
[OTH],Get it!
[OTH],What the?
[OTH],Throw it down!
[OTH],"Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures!"
[OTH],"Alright, let's go!"
[OTH],Huh where are you goin'?
Cartman,This is where you came from?
[OTH],"Yeah, I think so. Oh man."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on.
[OTH],"Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400."
[OTH],"Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?"
[OTH],We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
[OTH],"Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth"
[OTH],We don't care.
[OTH],"You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly."
[OTH],"Dude, we don't care."
[OTH],"Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off."
[OTH],We... don't... care.
[OTH],"All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?"
[OTH],"Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop."
[OTH],Who's they?
[OTH],"Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction."
[OTH],"Don't care, don't care, don't care."
[OTH],"Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again."
Cartman,"Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!"
[OTH],"I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at ""their"" base."
[OTH],"Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?"
[OTH],You mean to go right into their base? Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.
[OTH],"Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!"
[OTH],"Ah yes. Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?"
[OTH],Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.
[OTH],Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this.
[OTH],"Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles."
[OTH],"Hmm... So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!"
[OTH],Oo we...
[OTH],"He must have outsmarted us, sir."
[OTH],Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
[OTH],In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks."
[OTH],That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
[OTH],"Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you."
[OTH],"We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?"
[OTH],"Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Go go go go!
[OTH],"Dude, I figured it out."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!"
[OTH],"So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?"
[OTH],Seven and a half.
[OTH],"Hurry up, stupid parachute!"
Cartman,"Alright, I think we go over there."
[OTH],Let's see. No.
[OTH],"Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks."
[OTH],Hey it's been a long time!
Cartman,You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
[OTH],"Don't preach to me, fatso!"
Cartman,"I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!"
[OTH],You're stupid!
Cartman,"Yeah, and you're a towel!"
[OTH],You're a towel! Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.
[OTH],"Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! Here's your stupid lighter."
[OTH],Hold on. Wait a second That's it!
[OTH],That's it?
[OTH],"Yeah. That's the melody to ""Funky Town."" Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town."
[OTH],"No, Towelie, the entry code!"
[OTH],For what?
[OTH],"God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence."
[OTH],Well let's look in here.
[OTH],Kill... me... Kill... me.
[OTH],Oh my God! No-o-o-o!
[OTH],Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.
[OTH],What are these things?
[OTH],"Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid."
[OTH],Kill... me.
[OTH],Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
[OTH],"You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story."
[OTH],"Oh God, don't care, don't care."
[OTH],"Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret."
[OTH],Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
[OTH],What terrifying secret?
[OTH],That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
Cartman,"We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?"
[OTH],"Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know."
[OTH],And we don't care.
[OTH],"You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down."
[OTH],So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
[OTH],Oh yes. It has been all along.
[OTH],"Can I kill the towel now, sir?"
[OTH],Go ahead.
[OTH],"No, wait. Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all."
[OTH],But we don't care!
[OTH],What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!
[OTH],The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.
[OTH],We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!
[OTH],Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier.
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel!
[OTH],"Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. Then upload this encryption disk into their computers."
[OTH],We're just going in to get our video game back.
[OTH],"If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle."
[OTH],"Photon rifle, whatever."
[OTH],"Hello? Hello, anybody here?"
[OTH],"Welcome to the party, boys! HAAARRRHHHH!!"
[OTH],Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.
[OTH],HAAARRRHHHH!!
[OTH],"So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?"
[OTH],"Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move! Don't make a move, you bastards!"
[OTH],"Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children."
[OTH],Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
[OTH],"Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!"
[OTH],"Ohmigod, look!"
[OTH],Our GameSphere!
[OTH],"Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays."
[OTH],"You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!"
[OTH],"Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!"
Cartman,"Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level."
[OTH],Sweet!
[OTH],But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar!
[OTH],"Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!"
[OTH],Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.
[OTH],"And now you know the horrible truth, boys."
[OTH],"Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over!"
Cartman,Could you turn it up?
[OTH],"Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out! I think I can get it from here, boys!"
[OTH],What are you doing? You'll kill us all!
[OTH],"Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings."
[OTH],Oooww!
Cartman,"Hup hup. Come on, hang on."
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],(Help help! Heeelllppp!)
Cartman,Kenny!
[OTH],(Nooo!)
[OTH],Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer!
[OTH],"Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart!"
[OTH],What are you doing?
[OTH],"Get away from me, you evil towel!"
[OTH],"Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them."
[OTH],No way! They're my friends!
[OTH],"They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now."
[OTH],I've almost got it!
[OTH],"You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness. Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!"
[OTH],"Aw, crap!"
[OTH],"You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high."
[OTH],You asshole.
Cartman,"Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!"
[OTH],"Come, Towelie! Make your decision!"
[OTH],I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both!
[OTH],I got it!
[OTH],Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
[OTH],"Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!"
[OTH],Alright!
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],"Oh, dude, we finished level 50!"
[OTH],Awesome!
[OTH],"Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on."
[OTH],Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
[OTH],"Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level."
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel.
Cartman,"You're the worst character ever, Towelie."
[OTH],I know.
[OTH],HA! I killed you!
[OTH],"HA, I blew your head off!"
[OTH],"(Aw, Goddamnit!)"
[OTH],"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?"
[OTH],"Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?"
Cartman,Let a man take a crap!
[OTH],"Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet."
[OTH],"Hyeah, that poor, poor thing"
[OTH],"Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!"
Cartman,"I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper."
[OTH],"Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?"
Cartman,"Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody."
[OTH],Are you guys still playing that video game?
[OTH],"Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom."
Cartman,"Look. But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through."
[OTH],"Eric, put that down!"
Cartman,Why?
[OTH],Just go put it back in the trashcan!
Cartman,"Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive."
[OTH],No that... that came from me; just put it away.
Cartman,This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
[OTH],"What is it, Mom?"
[OTH],"Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?"
[OTH],"Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing. I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting."
[OTH],The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
[OTH],Sure.
[OTH],Cool!
Cartman,"Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!"
[OTH],There it is. The Okama GameSphere.
[OTH],"Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM."
[OTH],What's that?
[OTH],"Don't know, but it kicks ass. Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park."
Cartman,"Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere."
[OTH],"Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!"
[OTH],(Woohoo!)
[OTH],"Awesome! Oh, crap."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
[OTH],"Dude, we got GameSphere."
[OTH],"I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake."
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel.
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, ""Don't forget to bring a towel."""
[OTH],...O-kay.
[OTH],"Thanks, Towelie."
[OTH],Do you wanna get high?
[OTH],No.
[OTH],"Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games."
Cartman,"Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere."
[OTH],"Here you go, boys."
[OTH],AAAAAA.
[OTH],"Okay, turn it on."
[OTH],"""Okama GameSphere""!"
[OTH],Whoa!
[OTH],Thirst For BLOOD!
Cartman,"Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it."
[OTH],"Oh, this is so cool."
Cartman,"Bring it, bring it!"
[OTH],"Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late."
[OTH],"G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere."
Cartman,"Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"Nothing. Come on, Randy."
[OTH],"Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got- wha-what is it?"
Cartman,Date-rape psychosis.
[OTH],"Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon. I don't have to go outside!"
Cartman,Awesome!
[OTH],"She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight.."
[OTH],"Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!"
Cartman,We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
[OTH],"Well, it's alright. We can still play for six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball."
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel.
[OTH],Uh no.
[OTH],"When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, ""Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."""
[OTH],"Okay, we will."
[OTH],Alright! Do you wanna get high?
[OTH],No we don't wanna get high!
[OTH],Okay... You sure?
Cartman,"Yes! Go away, you stupid towel!"
[OTH],"Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!"
Cartman,That's... so... cool!
[OTH],"Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now."
[OTH],"No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer."
[OTH],"No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school."
Cartman,It's Monday?
[OTH],"Oh, uh, I'm sick."
[OTH],Me too.
[OTH],"No, you're not sick. Now get to school. All of you."
[OTH],But Mom...
[OTH],Go!
[OTH],Aagh!
[OTH],Can't believe we have to go to school!
[OTH],"Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid."
[OTH],We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere.
[OTH],"Hello, boys, how are you?"
[OTH],Fine.
[OTH],"Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere."
[OTH],What? You mean Towelie?
[OTH],"Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at... Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado!"
Cartman,"What, dude?"
[OTH],This is gonna be one looong-ass day.
[OTH],That was the longest day of school ever!
[OTH],"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29!"
[OTH],Where is it?
[OTH],It... it was right here.
[OTH],Where the hell is it??
Cartman,"Come on, man, this isn't funny! I need my fix!"
[OTH],Hello?
[OTH],"If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel."
[OTH],What? Who-who is this?
[OTH],Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else!
[OTH],Don't hurt it!
[OTH],What?
[OTH],They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
Cartman,No! ...No!
[OTH],"Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!"
[OTH],Towelie!
Cartman,"Hey, towel!"
[OTH],Where the hell is he?
[OTH],(I don't know. Where could it be?)
[OTH],"I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him."
[OTH],What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Cartman,Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. Gebaayybeh! Gebaayybeh!
[OTH],That's a towel call?
[OTH],This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
[OTH],"Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water."
[OTH],"Hey yeah. Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! Aaah. Let's go take a shower! Let's go waterskiing!"
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel.
[OTH],There he is!
[OTH],Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. .
[OTH],"Come on, dude!"
[OTH],Where are we goin'?
[OTH],Just come on! It's getting dark.
[OTH],Are we gonna get high?
[OTH],Are you sure this is where they said to be?
[OTH],They said the gas station outside of town.
[OTH],"Well, I'm gonna get a little high."
[OTH],Hold it!
[OTH],Who is that?
[OTH],Step... away... from the towel!
[OTH],"There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you."
[OTH],"If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel."
[OTH],"It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you."
[OTH],"'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games."
[OTH],Your what?
[OTH],"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!"
[OTH],I don't know what you're talking about.
[OTH],You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
[OTH],"Omigod! IT""S A TRAP!!"
[OTH],Cover! Cover!
[OTH],"Goddamnit, what now?!"
[OTH],"Run, towel!"
[OTH],"Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere."
[OTH],Where's the towel?!
[OTH],"It can't be far! Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!"
[OTH],Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!
[OTH],Where is our Okama GameSphere?
[OTH],"Get the towel home They will explain everything. Please, hurry!"
[OTH],"Aw, God-damnit!"
[OTH],"Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?"
[OTH],"What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away."
[OTH],"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys."
[OTH],Well?
[OTH],"They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air."
[OTH],Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel. They must have some unexplainable bond with it.
[OTH],"Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T."
[OTH],"It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B."
[OTH],You mean...?
[OTH],Yes. Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius.
[OTH],Are we getting close?
[OTH],I think so.
[OTH],"A little more gas, Kenny."
[OTH],How long has it been since you've been back there.
[OTH],"I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important."
Cartman,No it isn't.
[OTH],Is!
Cartman,No it isn't.
[OTH],"Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road."
[OTH],"Brake, Kenny, brake."
Cartman,Egh!
[OTH],M-maybe it's down that dirt road.
[OTH],"Dude, don't you remember where it is?"
[OTH],"I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high. then I'll remember where it is."
[OTH],"Alright, so where is it?"
[OTH],Where's what?
[OTH],Agh!
[OTH],The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is!
[OTH],"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!"
[OTH],Well calm down.
[OTH],That's it! You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
[OTH],"That's my last joint, asshole!"
[OTH],I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
[OTH],"Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit."
[OTH],"Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil. Kevin, is that you?"
[OTH],Harris! Reach bang and clear!
[OTH],Hello? WAAH! Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod!
[OTH],"Alright, it's clear! It's clear!"
[OTH],HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
[OTH],Let's go let's go!
[OTH],Get it!
[OTH],What the?
[OTH],Throw it down!
[OTH],"Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures!"
[OTH],"Alright, let's go!"
[OTH],Huh where are you goin'?
Cartman,This is where you came from?
[OTH],"Yeah, I think so. Oh man."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on.
[OTH],"Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400."
[OTH],"Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?"
[OTH],We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
[OTH],"Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth"
[OTH],We don't care.
[OTH],"You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly."
[OTH],"Dude, we don't care."
[OTH],"Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off."
[OTH],We... don't... care.
[OTH],"All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?"
[OTH],"Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop."
[OTH],Who's they?
[OTH],"Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction."
[OTH],"Don't care, don't care, don't care."
[OTH],"Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again."
Cartman,"Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!"
[OTH],"I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at ""their"" base."
[OTH],"Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?"
[OTH],You mean to go right into their base? Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.
[OTH],"Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!"
[OTH],"Ah yes. Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?"
[OTH],Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.
[OTH],Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this.
[OTH],"Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles."
[OTH],"Hmm... So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!"
[OTH],Oo we...
[OTH],"He must have outsmarted us, sir."
[OTH],Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
[OTH],In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
[OTH],Okay.
[OTH],"I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks."
[OTH],That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
[OTH],"Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you."
[OTH],"We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?"
[OTH],"Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?"
[OTH],Yeah.
[OTH],Go go go go!
[OTH],"Dude, I figured it out."
[OTH],What?
[OTH],"If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!"
[OTH],"So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?"
[OTH],Seven and a half.
[OTH],"Hurry up, stupid parachute!"
Cartman,"Alright, I think we go over there."
[OTH],Let's see. No.
[OTH],"Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks."
[OTH],Hey it's been a long time!
Cartman,You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
[OTH],"Don't preach to me, fatso!"
Cartman,"I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!"
[OTH],You're stupid!
Cartman,"Yeah, and you're a towel!"
[OTH],You're a towel! Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.
[OTH],"Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! Here's your stupid lighter."
[OTH],Hold on. Wait a second That's it!
[OTH],That's it?
[OTH],"Yeah. That's the melody to ""Funky Town."" Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town."
[OTH],"No, Towelie, the entry code!"
[OTH],For what?
[OTH],"God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence."
[OTH],Well let's look in here.
[OTH],Kill... me... Kill... me.
[OTH],Oh my God! No-o-o-o!
[OTH],Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.
[OTH],What are these things?
[OTH],"Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid."
[OTH],Kill... me.
[OTH],Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
[OTH],"You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story."
[OTH],"Oh God, don't care, don't care."
[OTH],"Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret."
[OTH],Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
[OTH],What terrifying secret?
[OTH],That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
Cartman,"We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?"
[OTH],"Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know."
[OTH],And we don't care.
[OTH],"You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down."
[OTH],So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
[OTH],Oh yes. It has been all along.
[OTH],"Can I kill the towel now, sir?"
[OTH],Go ahead.
[OTH],"No, wait. Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all."
[OTH],But we don't care!
[OTH],What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!
[OTH],The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.
[OTH],We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!
[OTH],Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier.
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel!
[OTH],"Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. Then upload this encryption disk into their computers."
[OTH],We're just going in to get our video game back.
[OTH],"If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle."
[OTH],"Photon rifle, whatever."
[OTH],"Hello? Hello, anybody here?"
[OTH],"Welcome to the party, boys! HAAARRRHHHH!!"
[OTH],Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.
[OTH],HAAARRRHHHH!!
[OTH],"So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?"
[OTH],"Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move! Don't make a move, you bastards!"
[OTH],"Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children."
[OTH],Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
[OTH],"Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!"
[OTH],"Ohmigod, look!"
[OTH],Our GameSphere!
[OTH],"Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays."
[OTH],"You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!"
[OTH],"Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!"
Cartman,"Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level."
[OTH],Sweet!
[OTH],But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar!
[OTH],"Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!"
[OTH],Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.
[OTH],"And now you know the horrible truth, boys."
[OTH],"Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over!"
Cartman,Could you turn it up?
[OTH],"Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out! I think I can get it from here, boys!"
[OTH],What are you doing? You'll kill us all!
[OTH],"Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings."
[OTH],Oooww!
Cartman,"Hup hup. Come on, hang on."
[OTH],Whoa.
[OTH],(Help help! Heeelllppp!)
Cartman,Kenny!
[OTH],(Nooo!)
[OTH],Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer!
[OTH],"Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart!"
[OTH],What are you doing?
[OTH],"Get away from me, you evil towel!"
[OTH],"Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them."
[OTH],No way! They're my friends!
[OTH],"They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now."
[OTH],I've almost got it!
[OTH],"You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness. Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!"
[OTH],"Aw, crap!"
[OTH],"You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high."
[OTH],You asshole.
Cartman,"Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!"
[OTH],"Come, Towelie! Make your decision!"
[OTH],I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both!
[OTH],I got it!
[OTH],Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
[OTH],"Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!"
[OTH],Alright!
Cartman,Hooray!
[OTH],"Oh, dude, we finished level 50!"
[OTH],Awesome!
[OTH],"Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on."
[OTH],Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
[OTH],"Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level."
[OTH],Don't forget to bring a towel.
Cartman,"You're the worst character ever, Towelie."
[OTH],I know.
